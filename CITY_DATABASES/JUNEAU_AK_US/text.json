        "wiki": "The Alaska State Museum is a museum in Juneau, Alaska, United States.  After a $139 million renovation, it re-opened after a two-year and three-month closure. The museum closed temporarily on February 28, 2014 for the creation of a new facility that joined the State Libraries, Archives and Museum (SLAM) together in a comprehensive research facility. The old structure, designed by Linn A. Forrest, was demolished in August 2014, and a new facility opened on the same footprint (but larger), on June 6, 2016. The new building was named after the first curator for the Alaska State Museum, the Russian Orthodox priest, Father Andrew P. Kashevaroff. This building is also known as the APK.\nThe Museum's collections include cultural materials from the people of the Northwest Coast (Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian), the Athabascan cultures of Interior Alaska, the Inupiaq of the north coast, and the Yup'ik of the southwest of Alaska, the Alutiiq people of Prince William Sound and Kodiak Island, and the Unangax from out along the Aleutian chain. Artifacts from the state's Russian colonial eras, state and political history, fine art (including contemporary art), natural history, industry and trades can also be found on exhibit.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Altho this excellent museum concentrates on the history, geography, wildlife, and Native cultures of Southeastern Alaska, it also displays information about the other regions of Alaska. Very good displays!",
          "The artifacts are marvelous and the building is beautiful. The legends in the displays telling you about individual items are not well-organized. That is disappointing and can be frustrating. It's not always clear what the organizing principle is--is there a chronological",
          "It was a rainy day in Juneau so we decided to go into this museum and kill some time. The museum building is very new and modern compared with other buildings in town. It is mainly split into two sections: natural history and World War Two period. I was particularly interested",

          "I've been to a lot of museums throughout the U.S., and this one holds up very well. It's moderately priced to get in ($7 per person), and it's packed with stuff that is interesting, including original artifacts. If you're going to be in Juneau, this is an absolute must-stop.",

          "My friend and I went here especially to get out of the rain. What a wonderful museum!! So many displays and artifacts!! Well worth seeing and well worth the price of $12.00 dollars.We spent a couple of hours in here. Very interesting!! Would recommend seeing this great museum!!",
          "This was part of cruise excursion and we were frankly more interested in the other two portions when we booked. We were told we would have about 1.5 hours here, and we thought that was plenty of time. However, our tour driver warned it wasn't nearly enough to really appreciate",
          "We thought the museum was excellent. It provided a good start to learning more about Alaska in preparation for our inside passage cruise. Great gift shop, too!",

The museum has Science on a Sphere\u00ae, or \u201cSOS.\u201d This is a display system that uses computers, video projectors, and a six foot diameter sphere to create an animated globe. The museum staff stopped to demo",

          "Our glacier tour was delayed due to weather, so we decided to check out the Alaska State Museum and I'm so glad we had a chance to go! We walked from the cruise port...a bit of a walk but not terribly far. The museum itself really isn't that large, but they have so many",
          "The Alaska State Museum is absolutely packed with artifacts that help tell the story of Alaska's past. A visitor needs to be on the lookout for exhibits both overhead as well as underfoot! Explanations of each exhibit are clear and helpful. This is a must-see in Juneau.",
          "I think this museum is a must see if you are in Juneau. The collection is displayed beautifully and isn't overwhelming. We learned so much about the history of Alaska from the First People, the Russians and finally the United States. The museum covers so much including the",
          "A new and well-designed building lends itself to a sensitive, beautiful, and descriptive display about all of the different Nations that made up what is now Alaska. There are also small, poignant displays on the Russian imperialist and US-imperialist times. Then, you move on",
          "A very interesting museum, however I really don\u2019t have enough background on the Alaskan native population to appreciate the finer points. The exhibits on attempts to map Alaska, the early Russian influence, and the sale to America, were all vary informative.The movie on the",

          "I was an anthropologist and the Alaskan native history is so beautifully told it is hard to describe.",
          "The displays are really amazing! I could have spent all day here... The staff in the archives room were particularly helpful; found and copied several old documents for my spouse. The building is lovely, clean, worth a visit just for itself.",

          "This museum has some nice features for young kids including a play ship and a globe exhibit which provides different views of the world. The architecture is beautiful and modern as well. A great 2 hour visit, but better in the morning before the kids get too tired.",
          "We arrived here like everyone else--on a ship. But instead of just shopping or looking for wildlife, I decided to get some culture. Really glad I did, because other than some patronizing indoctrination about the oppression and exploitation of the Native Alaskans, I enjoyed",
          "Overall a very good museum, and as expected, it was a bit dry for our teenagers. They did have a really cool interactive (2-person) video game that mollified them, however. Also, you can create your own art (fun - I put mine on the wall!). The SS Princess Sophia exhibit was an",
          "This is a very well done museum on both the culture and history of this wonderful land. Do spend some time watching the video screens in the entry way about AK and its size, population, tribal areas, etc. This is one Giant state!",

          "Our tour stop of 90 minutes was inadequate. This is a very nice small museum packed with displays and information. If you have some flexibility, it would be great for a rainy day as there are a lot of outdoor activities to draw you away. Very informative, thorough, and",

          "The museum is well laid out and has loads of information about the history of Alaska. You could spend all day here if you wanted to read everything and not miss anything. There is a cost, but very reasonable.",
          "Interesting historical exhibits telling the story or Alaska and Juneau. Did leave feeling rather sorry for the native peoples - who seemed to have had a \"choice\" of being exploited by the Russians, or exploited by the Americans at different points int time. But also impressed",
          "Great museum with lots of variety and loads of history that you don't read about in the lower 48. Excellent collection of artifacts.",
          "First of all, the venue is terrific and very well utilized in terms of all spaces. The quality of Tlingit, Tsimshian & Haida artefacts is suburb. Exhibits flow from Russian occupation to the sale of Alaska in 1867 to the USA. Mining, logging & fishing industries are well",
          "This museum is a little off the beaten tourist path if you\u2019re arriving by cruise ship. Our ship only mentioned the closer Juneau city museum, which we didn\u2019t visit. We\u2019re sure that one is fine too, but we really enjoyed the state museum. It has something for everyone and covers",
          "This is a great spot to learn about Alaskan culture and history. Very attractive museum space that you can tour easily on your own. Native cultures, World War II, the Gold Rush, and the fishing and lumber industries are all on display with artifacts and photos. Nice gift shop,",
          "So much information to see, read, and absorb. The large chainsaw was awesome. The amount of information is so much maybe browsing is best to just get the highlights and previews of what you have seen and what you will see while in Alaska.",
          "Very, very interesting. I learned a lot and could go at my own speed. If your interested in learning about the Alaskan way of life in the early days, this is the place!",
          "This is a very well-done museum in a beautiful building. There is a very large collection of Native American artifacts, as well as exhibits on Russian Alaska and the forgotten battles of World War II. The layout of the museum makes it easy to navigate. This was a great escape",
          "The museum was initially not high on my list of activities that I wanted to do when I visited Juneau, but I was extremely glad that I went here. There is an amazing collection of beautifully displayed Tlingit and Haida artifacts, both modern and dating back to before the little",
          "This is a wonderfully curated museum with a smooth flow. You move through time... and state history... as you walk past the exhibits. Excellent exhibits. I especially enjoyed the section about the Gold Rush and mining. Juneau is lucky to have a museum of this caliber! Nice",
          "This was a very nicely displayed and well thought out look at Alaskan culture and history. Displays were carefully planned and the themes easy to understand. Their history sections on the Alaskan Gold Rush and World War II in the Aleutian Islands were particularly useful.",
          "We enjoyed 2 hours walking around this museum that displays the Alaska history and artifacts. It is definitely worth a visit although it is small but items are nicely displayed!",
          "Enjoyable, informative and never felt crowded. I was in the museum when a large group came in on a tour. The museum never felt crowded. It was great to see people of all ages enjoying the museum. This is a place that one could come back to several times and learn something new",
          "The Museum is state of the art exhibits that are interactive, and full of history. The other delight is the Raven Cafe (not to be confused with the one on Front Stree) They serve the most delicious Adobe burrito filled with tasty soft pork and chicken. The couple who manage this",
          "Loved the art of Nathan Jackson, did not know at the time that I will see him in person the following day in Ketchikan at the Saxman Totem Park, where he has his studio. The museum is quite new, I believe two years old and was extremely informative and impressive.",
          "We arrived just before the threatening rainstorm and entered after enjoying a coffee from the shop that shares the building. The museum is well laid out with the progression of history leading you to the present. There is a lot of information and a variety of items to keep you",
          "The Alaska State Museum is a gem and the best excursion in town. Twelve dollars for adults will get you in to spend as little or as much time as you want. The museum is a walkable distance from the ship and filled with great exhibits, information and history of the area. While",
          "Visited as part of my post cruise tour. I found it interesting. History of Alaska, stuffed animals from Alaska. It also has a current Alaska art section.",
          "We are so glad we stopped to checkout this museum. Yes, it is a little small but it is a great size for getting out of the rain and a short stay from a cruise ship. The history to be found was both fun and educational. A very good way to spend a few hours. We very much enjoyed",
          "We popped in to see this place. It is VERY small but informative. Do it. And check out the store next to it where you can purchase some native art at very reasonable prices.",
          "You can easily walk here from the cruise ships, if that is how you have arrived in Juneau. The museum has recently been re-done and it is excellent. A good overview of Alaskan history with everything from the 5,450 year old Thorne River basket through the Second World War. You",
          "It's a small museum but worth a visit because it shows the different periods of Alaska's habitation. Lots of interesting artifacts, and a great place to visit during a rainy day in Juneau",
          "Interesting visit and informative, some of the guides on hand to answer questions are first nation and gave interesting respinses when we asked about certain aspects of the museum and local history. A much better way to spend time than the Lumberjack show down the road. Learning",
          "The Alaska State Museum is great! There is a lot of history about the Native culture and persecution as well as Russian influence. This is a fun adventure into history for all ages. The admission really is awesome, and the artifacts are preserved nicely.",
          "I'm not usually a huge museum fan, but I spent an entire morning walking around this one. They had an impressive display of exhibits, showing the evolution of Alaska and Alaskan traditions through time. Definitely one of the best ones I've been to.",
          "We weren't sure what to expect. Turns out, we found a very enjoyable afternoon exploring Alaskan history. The artifacts were well laid out and had a good story to tell. Of particular interest to us was the early inhabitants and the Russian influence. I suspect it can get",
          "Such a neat experience and variety of culture and history. Can't beat free admission! Offers great admission pricing for standard tickets, children, seniors, and military. So much to learn. Hours vary upon the websites you look up, but they definitely close at 4p. Excellent show",
          "No pun intended there - Juneau was the start of our Alaska trip, and we stumbled into the museum on a rainy day. We were late, with only 45 minutes left in their day, but we got in for half price. It's gorgeous and sweeping and well-signed and features high-value, high-interest",
          "I was impressed by the quality of exhibits and the sense of history the museum instills. Kudos to the curators.",
          "Relatively new museum, with more artifacts on display since the previously upgraded museum. Informative interactive displays, paying special interest to Alaska Native culture and historical developments over time.",
          "We decided to do some more of the local things whilst in Juneau. We spent almost 3 hours in there just learning about the culture of the area, They have a very unique collection of indigenous artefacts that I have seen. I would recommend anyone who is going for a day to see the",
          "Very well presented museum with lots of history and exhibits. We were fortunate to also see a current exhibition. Good activity for a rainy day or to while away a couple of hours. The library upstairs looks excellent.",
          "This very attractive and well organized museum manages to cover a lot in a in a fairly compact space. Both the history and the native art of the state are represented, including such little remembered periods as the Russian rule over Alaska, and the Japanese occupation of some",
          "This is a beautiful building with attractive displays. We spent about two hours there and left feeling like we should have spent more time. They do an excellent job of presenting the early history of Alaska. There is so much there that you could get tired of reading. This",
          "We had extra time while waiting to go to he airport in Juneau so we decided to go explore downtown. We are glad we had time to experience the Alaska State Museum. We don't normally take the time to visit museums but this was a good experience for us. Another positive is that",
          "Alaska should be proud of their state of the art museum . The design and information is presented in a beautiful format. Amazing how much is provided in such easy flow space. Fortunate for us we were able to see the special art exhibit! We have Grand children that would have",
          "This museum provided a great overview of Alaska and its history. It is a short 4 block walk from the cruise ship pier and is an inexpensive way to spend an afternoon while avoiding all of the pricier tours offered.",
          "Spent a couple of hours here on a cruise ship stop. Lots of stuff to see and learn here from first nations to present day. Some good exhibits. Admission a bit pricey but hey ho.",
          "We visited the State Museum in mid-September. The collection of coastal Alaska Native American art and artifacts is absolutely spectacular! If visitors only do one thing in Juneau, it should be this beautiful museum with its wonderful collection. The story of the development of",
          "Wheelchairs and elevators available. Parking garage under the museum. The design and flow of the museum are well though out. This building appears to be fairly new---there were display drawers throughout that didn't yet have items in them. It will not take away from the",
          "Went here to see the history of Alaska as the first stop on a cruise. We were not disappointed. The interactive displays and artifacts were well presented and not boring.",
          "This is a huge place, like the State. It has wonderful exhibits from the earliest days with the various tribes, up to present day activities. Make sure you see the original Alaska state flag and the exhibits on Steward.",
          "A quick tour of Alaska history and culture. Best parts were how Native Alaskans made kayaks and then hunted whales from them, and WWII in Alaska. Also a section on shipwrecks.",
          "This was a wonderful museum to get such an overview of Alaska. it is a beautiful place to begin with and filled with so much. It is put together so you are not overwhelmed with stuff but really get an understanding of Alaska and its history. It is just a short walk from where",
          "Caught a guided tour of this museum and thought the knowledge of the guide was outstanding. A much better experience of the history of the land than if I was wandering around myself. Great museum. Very well done.",
          "This quiet little museum is a great place to get a little insight into Alaska's area and history. The building is right next to the river walk that takes you downtown.",
          "We loved the informative, colorful displays, and the gift shop had some excellent items at good prices!",
          "Vibrant colors & design of the Aboriginal Art, way of life & culture. Small museum. Staff were friendly. But, no actual tours were given.",
          "$12 entry fee for a loop around the first floor. If you haven't seen one of the Alaska museums you should see this one. Quick side trip just a few minutes walk from the cruise dock.",
          "The Alaska State Museum is a great activity for a rainy day. You need about 90 minutes to check out all of the exhibits but you can easily spend more time if you watch all the videos and read all of the artifact descriptions. Bring your camera as there will be many",
          "Nicely done and apparently newly opened museum. Very informational and easy to follow. I enjoyed the Native American section at the beginning and the art displays at the end the best.",
          "Walking distance to Cruise Port. A lot to see inside. Nice gift shop. They have a great library where you can access everything you need. Free Wi-Fi if you were stuck in the cruise without one.",
          "This was included as part of our John Hall's Alaska land tour. Senior pricing was available. A weekly children's program was available for the locals. A very complete museum including a planetarium for an additional charge.",
          "The turbulent story of Alaska's history is told, with artifacts, stories, and photos. There is even a section on AK becoming a state, ; the code talker medals from WWII; and a unique art gallery. We learned a lot.",
          "Beautiful museum with a rich story of Alaska. It was the perfect place to get to know the history of the land.",
          "A perfect place to visit on a rainy, cold day in Juneau. It is very well done with history and memorabila of Alaska. Four of us walked from the cruise ship to it's location.",
          "Spending 2-3 hours at the fantastic musium is a must. Just the right amount of display and detail, along with tour guides makes if worth while.",
          "Beautiful new museum with plenty of great information about the history and culture of native people. I couldn't enjoy the excellent displays about killing seals and WWII.",
          "We spent two hours at the museum, Fascinating exhibits. We traveled with my two grandsons, age 13 and 18. They loved it!",
          "this museum is well worth a visit while in juneau.it is a beautiful building and has many items of alaska.",
          "This museum offers fascinating and well-organized exhibits on the complex history of Alaska. Do not miss the great explanation of the native cultures of Alaska by region, including fascinating artifacts and beautiful crafts. If you ever wondered how people could survive and",
          "The history of Alaska is rich and this museum takes you through this chronologically dating back to 14,000 years in the with mammoth remains all the way through modern Alaska... A must see in Juneau",
          "Some fabulous native tribe clothes and utensils. Hard to beat. Spent half hour here. Then room of history of gutting Alaska (my take) resources, oil, whatever was a walk through for me. Exxon Valdez soured me... Then 2 rooms of contemporary/ native art. Alas one room is a temp",
          "We had a whole day in Anchorage and decided to visit this museum. It's a 4 storey building, with great information on science and the Alaskan culture. I would skip the planetarium, it was not very impressive and is very small. Overall nice place to spend few hours (2-3 hrs).",
          "This museum is so well done. It's one of the best museums I visited on our 2 week tour of Alaska. Great history, art, gift shop, views of downtown Juneau. Don't miss the large Eagle next replica in the lobby! If you're a history lover, YOU MUST GO!",
          "Like many travelers I have visited numerous museum around the country and world - this is in the top 5 for sure. The building is beautiful and the collections curated in a clear, chronological, creative fashion. Kids will not be bored here and adults completely engaged!",
          "Especially great if it rains out, but if you have spare time, go there. It's small, but well stocked and presented. Make sure to pull out drawers underneath display cases for more artifacts.",
          "I loved that this museum told the history of Alaska from the perspective of the colonized, rather than the colonizer. This is an important museum that taught me so much about the rich Alaska Native history and culture.",
          "The Alaska State Museum launched me to a more intellectual adventure. My mind was transported back thousands of years, and walked through Alaskan heritage and history from the first North Americans to modern day artists and pop culture. This was the best Native American, or",
          "This museum is especially useful in understanding the Tlingit people and culture. They have amazing artifacts and present a vivid portrait of how the native people survived and thrived in harsh conditions. I highly recommend a visit as well as a similar museum in Sitka",
          "A great museum for people of all ages. It has a nice collection of archaeological exhibits, as well as art and other special things.",
          "Only open a little over a year. This place houses so much cultural and native history of the pioneers of Alaska. It was really interesting. I stayed about 2 1/2 hours could have spend more time but was catching a boat out of town.I was fortunate that the museum Director happened",
          "Loved this museum! Beautifully laid out and with a wealth of artefacts depicting early Alaskan history. Also loved the section devoted to current creative artworks by native Alaskans",
          "this is only a year old, state of the art museum about all things, Alaska. Items that we have never seen before, and we go to a lot of musuems, all relevant and well displayed. Sometimes the signage isn't as clear as to what item it refers to but most of the time there is no",
          "Enjoyed this museum for overall history of area. It was a little expensive to get in, but all very thoughtfully presented and cozy. Artifact details were on the glass which made the presentation cases look much less cluttered.",
          "We walked here from the cruise ship terminal after a visit to the Mendenhall Glacier. We had learned a bit from lectures on our ship about Alaska and this Museum brought it to life. I covered everything - the native peoples, Gold Rush, Russians, etc. Plenty to see, probably more",
          "Great insight into Alaskan history & culture. Very clean. Many boat exhibits. History from Russian times to today.",
          "Good descriptions of more modern Alaskan history, the gold rush, mining, logging, wars, etc. I would have liked to have seen more about the distant past, how the first Alaskans might have got there and when. Also the discussion of climate warming/melting is obviously made",
          "When our cruise ship got to Juneau we were scheduled for a whale watch and glacier visit, but a cold rain was falling so we took a walk from the ship into town and visited several shops and this museum. The building is modern and the exhibits are attractive; we particularly",
          "My husband and I both enjoyed our visit to the Alaska State Museum in Juneau while visiting by cruise ship The museum is 10000 square feet and covers all of Alaska history including its part in World War 2 This Museum is new and definitely worth a visit",
          "This museum building is new and gorgeous. Beautiful displays make learning about Alaska's fascinating history and cultures a rewarding experience. When I was there, I was particularly impressed with the display of contemporary art by native artists. This is definitely a museum",

          "This well laid out museum was really a treasure and even though we were quite tired when we visited we did most of it in about 2 hours. Well laid out exhibits tell the cultural, military, and political history of the state. Our only complaint was that we got inconsistent",

          "We only had an hour to explore this museum and really could have used twice that amount of time. This is a little away from the tourist trap area of Juneau - reason enough to visit! - and is well worth the visit. It provides a very good description through its exhibits of the",

          "We had a couple hours to spend on a rather wet day in Juneau and decided to go to the museum. Not a disappointment! Wish we had had a little more time. At the Globe near the exit, you are able to view three dimensional presentations of global features including time lapses of",
          "Juneau was our first port on our cruise. We walked around the city on our own, and this wonderful museum was easy to walk to. Looking at the displays of Alaskan history and highlights turned out to be a great activity that set the scene for everything we would be experiencing on",
          "We spent a lot more time here than expected. Limited number of locally relevant subject areas covered very well with several push-a-button options on maps and diagrams that add way more depth than the size leads you to expect.",
          "The recent reviews are an accurate reflection of what's going on with this place. It is definitely small compared to other state museums but it's extremely detailed and efficient. I arrived 1.5 hours before closing and I could have easily stayed a little longer. It was the",
          "The museum offers an extensive display of artifacts from wooly mammoth tusks up to a modern day art collection. Of most interest to me were the artifacts from the indigenous tribes characterizing their way of life. There is also a display including short video clips of the",

          "This museum is world class - don't miss it! We found it by chance as it was mentioned on a map of Juneau, and what an absolute gem. The new building is just over a year old apparently, and a huge amount of thought has gone into the layout, the exhibits and the ambience. We",
          "Had a fun and educational time learning all about the native culture and their innovations. A must see for anyone interested in how our 49th state came about.",

          "Much bigger than it looks, appears shiny and new, lots of great exhibits. Kids get in free but there is not much for them to keep them entertained. I thought many of the exhibits were interesting. Waaaaayyyyy too much emphasis on the native tribes, too much detail. Would",

          "Had an afternoon to spend waiting for our ship so we decided to check out the State Museum. Boy are we glad we did! The museum covers Alaska, it's Native people and history very well. We got a wonderful overview of this magnificent state. The exhibits are presented very well and",
          "Allocate 90-120 minutes for this wonderful museum. I was surprised at how fascinating Alaskan history is. I had forgotten, for example, that Japan occupied a couple Alaskan islands in WWII for a year. The last room you go through has a really cool electronic exhibit. If you",

          "You could easily spend a day or more here. Incredible exhibits on Alaska's Native peoples, as well as those who came later, including Philippinos, Japanese, Chinese, Russians, and Americans from the lower 48. This is not history that's been glossed over--it presents what really",
          "Leaving our cruise we stopped at the Library at the top of the cruise terminal parking lot to use the free internet. Then we walked to the Juneau City museum which has a very good exhibit on gold mining historically in the area. Then we walked to the Alaska State Museum. This",

          "Surprisingly good museum in a small city - excellent displays about indigenous culture. Good facilities for visitors.",
          "We especially enjoyed the current (May 2017) exhibit \"De-Colonizing Alaska\". The museum is new, admission is very inexpensive. We spent 3 hours there and barely scratched the surface. Worth a morning or afternoon in Juneau on one of their (many) rainy/foggy days.",
          "A great museum. Not too big but big enough and with lots to see so make sure you allow enough time. I spent 3 hours and would have loved to come back. There are convenient benches to sit throughout. Several of the displays are very children friendly (and very adult enjoyable,",

          "Great way to spend a few hours out of the cold on a Fall day & learn about a vast range of Alaskan history & culture. The new displays are well presented, easy to access & provide plenty of information to read & take in. From animals to native culture, science & history & then",
          "Just a few months old when we visited inAug. '16. Well worth the price of admission, maybe $10 . I don't remember exactly. Very professional exhibits. Very educational start to 18 days in Ak.",
          "Had some friends come visit Juneau during the offseason. Brought them to the Museum. It is a very nice, new, and well designed. It is great for adults and take about 30 to 60 minuets. I will say it is seriously lacking in interactive exhibits for kids. If brining young ones with",
          "Most of Juneau has ugly 60s style governmental buildings that are concrete coffins without any taste. Contrast that to the newest addition to the city - the Alaska State Museum and Library. Opened in 2016, this building is bright and airy, and it features a one floor showcase of",
          "The state museum is in walking distance of the cruise dock. It is new and has a great deal of locale history and artifacts. Plan 2 hours if you can. We had to keep moving to make it in a hour..",
          "First off, don't do what we did and arrive there late in the day. There's just too much wonderful stuff to see to give this short shrift. We arrived 30 minutes before closing and were allowed to enter for half-price. There are lockers available if you have more stuff than you",
          "Visited here briefly, not long after it opened. It is not a large museum, but they have done an excellent job of packing in many interesting displays and artifacts representative of the people and events that have carved their imprints into what is today Alaska. I would",
          "My husband and I were in Juneau for the day and finished up our day with a city tour. The very nice trolley driver took us around town. He dropped us off at the museum and picked us up an hour later. I was so very impressed with the presentation of artifacts and the stories",
          "While not free ( I think it was around $11) this is a great way to spend a couple of hours in Juneau. It is an easy (flat) walk from the cruise ship docks. Refurbished in 2015 it clearly sets out all aspects of Alaskan history in extremely interesting exhibits. It is also very",
          "This museum is a must visit if want to learn about Alaskan history, the way the historical time line is set out and the quality of exhibits make this museum an absolute must see. We are people who frequent museums often and this one rates right at the top for us. The displays",
          "What an incredible museum! We learned so much about the native people as well as about the Russian settlers and early American setters. Nice collection of artifacts as well as some mammoth tusks. They even have a great restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the museum.",
          "Beautifully curated. The exhibits are stunning: you need to look in every direction (including up at the ceiling) to take in all there is to see! We enjoyed the exhibit of contemporary Alaskan art as well as the displays of Russian artifacts from the seventeen and eighteen",
          "Great museum. Renovated, space for much more. Lots of history of native Alaskans, early Russian and American history of the area. Many artifacts, some natural history too. Spent an hour or so - could have spent more. Part of our trip with Alaskan Dream Cruises.",
          "We visited it at the end of August 2016 during a cruise trip. In short, it is excellent in its size and I strongly recommend it. When we took the bus to Mendenhall Glacier, the driver strongly recommend it and then we decided to add it to our Juneau list on our way back to the",
          "First opportunity to review this Museum ,following our visit in July .Newly refurbished I have never been anywhere quite like it .Who ever designed it really knew what they were doing .One of the best features was the fact that the signing around the exhibits was such that you",
          "This museum opened the week before our visit and it is terrific. Superb treatment of native peoples and of the Russian and early American era.",
          "Neat museum that describes Alaska's history from the native populations to today. We had about two hours but could have spent a bit more time. For those who don't want to read everything, two hours is probably about right.",
          "Great selection of First Nation artefacts and the various stages of Alaskan history. Makes a colourful and engaging display of history. Worth a visit.",
          "I really liked the Alaska State Museum before, but I love it now. We visited shortly after they reopened, while the exhibit labels were still being added. There were a number of items not yet labeled, and a couple of items mislabeled, such as a miners' oil cap lamp labeled as a",

          "We walked to this wonderful new museum from our cruise ship mooring, about a :15 walk. The museum was well worth the walk, but we found the signage hard to read and wondered if we were in the right place or if the museum was open. Spent an hour there and wished we'd had",
          "The museum is a brief walk from downtown. It provides an instructional and enjoyable overview of the history and culture of Alaska and it's residents over time. The artifacts and educational displays are exceptional for a small state museum. In addition, it offers a very nice",
          "I visited the new location of the Alaska State Museum in Juneau September 2016, on one of the last cruise ship stops for the season. The exhibits are all spectacular in the new location, but I did miss the gift shop, where I had planned to buy lots of gifts to take back home.",
          "The museum has been around for a long time but just opened in a fresh, new, impressive structure in June 2016. It's a bit of a walk from the piers but well worth it. It's beautifully laid out chronologically, with excellent and well-maintained exhibits, and a friendly staff.",
          "Great museum to learn about the culture, history, and economic development of Alaska. This is the place to spend 2-3 hours and understand the state. There is a focus on the southeast tribes culturally, but they do have artifacts from other regions. But, the interior of the state",
          "This newly re-modeled and re-opened museum is well worth a visit. The building is very nice and the displays are very interesting, going all the way to the indigenous people who first migrated to Alaska. We spent 2 hours at the museum but could easily have spent more time",
          "The new museum just opened in June, 2016. The facility houses the museum, state library and archives. It has the best collection of diverse native Alaskan cultural items that we saw on our Alaskan trip. This is not a large facility, but it is well done. We also wanted some",
          "This museum is completely new and reopened only 2 months ago. The dsiplays were so intelligently and LEGIBLY presented it was a joy to go through. The museum showed the different groups of native Alaskans with their distinctive clothing, boats/kayaks, hunting methods, art and",
          "We loved this museum and were sorry that we had only allowed a couple of hours to visit - we could have spent much longer. They have excellent exhibits on the native Alaskan people groups, and detailed information on their long history, culture, technology, trade, etc.",

          "This is a beautiful Museum/Library. It is well worth visiting just to see the building. The floor in the entryway is made of white and gray granite composing a large map of Alaska with markings indicating locations of cities/towns. The library on the upper level has a",
          "The Alaska State Museum just reopened this summer after a major renovation. We found a very nice structure with excellent exhibits where we enjoyed a pleasant two hours inspecting displays of the history of Alaska. The first exhibits inside the door are native Alaskan culture.",
          "The displays on Alaska's native and Russian heritage were excellent. I learned a lot. The natives have been in Alaska for the past 14,500 years and the Russians arrived in the 1741. They stayed for 135 years until they sold Alaska to the U.S. in 1867. The artifacts are very",
          "AK has done a great job with the displays in the new museum. The Alaskan Natives displays are of great interest.",
          "An amazing museum. I only wish we had more time to enjoy it. I advise at least 2 hours to fully appreciate all the exhibits. Of particular interest, the exits on Alaska's role in WWII was quite complete and introduced those of us from the Lower 48 to a bit of fairly obscure",

          "A recently renovated museum devoted to the history of Alaska. They do a good job covering the basics without overwhelming - from the native peoples to the Russians to Alaska's statehood. Of particular interest to us was the part Alaska played in World War 2.",
          "Your walk through the museum takes you step by step through known history, starting many thousands of years ago. The displays give a very thorough review, especially, of Alaskan indigenous peoples, but also the Russian and US periods.",

          "We were in Juneau for five days in July. It rained hard and was foggy four of the five. The Alaska State Museum was close by and we made it a morning activity. The exhibits exceeded my expectations. I understand this museum was recently remodeled. They did a great job with the",
          "Well laid out and very informative and gives you a good background on the history of the region. Well worth the visit if you're in the region.",
          "We spent 2.5 hours in this wonderful state museum and could have logged on another few hours but had museum fatigue... There is an amazing Native American crafts exhibit. It is beuatifully curated. Organized historically which helped us understand how Alaska came to be.",

          "The Alaska State Museum in Juneau underwent a $139 million renovation over the last couple years, joining together the Museum, Library, and Archives in one contemporary facility. Having only opened as recently as June 6, 2016, sad to say the museum was immediately hit with",
          "Excellent exhibit, helpful staff. The timeline presented, from early 1st Nation peoples up through current time was an excellent way to present the history and culture of the area. Very well done....as good as many of the high budget exhibits run by the national government",
          "The museum openned only a few weeks ago, so they are still a work in progress. No gift shop or cafe yet, and some of the f the displays aren't labeled yet. However, the facility is gorgeous and the Alaska Native peoples displays were incredible. We were so inspired and learned",
          "A nice little break from the Disneyland'esque nature of downtown Juneau or an add-on to other activities in the Juneau area. If you are interested in history, you will appreciate the scope of the displays and the attention to be culturally sensitive to chronicling the history of",
          "The exhibits are well done and the building is attractive. When we visited it was only in it's 6th week of operation so a lot of it was still under construction. There are a few rooms of nice contemporary Alaskan art, and good artifacts tracing the chronological history of",

          "Got free vouchers to visit here, it only took us about an hour to have a look around as we had seen similar things in other museums in Alaska. Believe the space needs greater utilisation - two rooms of contemporary art work. The building is nicely designed and attractive upon",
          "The newly re-opened State Museum is a gem, I cannot begin to describe the outstanding exhibits and artifacts contained in the many rooms. If possible, get a volunteer guide. Our older lady guide was fabulous in describing the exhibits and their history.",

          "Just opened. Chock-full of historical artifacts of native peoples and a good overview of Alaskan history. Wish we had had more time. The museum closes at 5 pm...quite early considering sunset is so late during the Summer tourist season. Some features are not yet open (gift",

          "We found out the museum had just opened and we were excited but we were disappointed that the exhibits were relatively disorganized and disjointed. Some of the text repeated itself from exhibit to exhibit, and it wasn't always easy to follow where we were supposed to go. They",
          "as part of our cruise the entrance to the state museum was included. we arrived much earlier than the rest of the group, and we had no trouble getting in. as the museum had been open for less than a month you could tell the staff was still trying to get the hang of things!",
          "The Alaska State Museum is housed in a brand new, beautiful building and we loved it! I decremented the rating from EXCELLENT to VERY GOOD because the building is somewhat difficult to find. We visited the museum on a rainy Saturday in June and since we were \"out of towners\" we",
          "When we got off our cruise ship, we bypassed all tourist shops not sure of where we would go in our first stop in Alaska. We saw the signs for a museum and followed them to discover the Alaska State Museum that had been open only 6 weeks in its new location. What a beautiful",

          "We wandered in here early morning on one of the first days it had reopened (the sign on the walking trail still said it was closed!). Loved the sphere - I can't describe it, you have to see it. Exhibits were well done and put things in context, so it was a learning experience as",
          "This museum is easy to get to in downtown Juneau, a short walk from the cruise terminal & so much more interesting than the tourist trap shops clustered around there. It looks like it has undergone a recent renovation &is well set out with lots of interesting displays. It is",
          "This new museum tells the unvarnished story of Alaska's difficult history, through the eyes of those who first inhabited the land. The gift shop and coffee shop were not open yet but the museum is a gem that needs to be on the itinerary of anyone traveling through Juneau.",
          "The new museum just opened and it's beautiful inside and out! Stunning decor, great displays and showcases - they have lots of things to boast and be proud of! The only thing I was disappointed was the display of the check for 7.2 mln dollars for purchasing Alaska. The new",

          "We visited the new museum location a week after it opened, they were still taking notes for what needed doing. But the exhibits were fantastic, highly recommend you go! There is a lot of information about Native Alaskans and the history from Russia to the purchase by the U.S.",
          "Staff at the museum seem proud of their museum, with reason. The museum is easy to navigate, exhibits are presented in an elegant, informative and attractive manner. We learnt much about the culture and history that we came to find out about. The added bonus of the art",
          "The museum just opened 5 weeks prior to our visit, so they were still getting maps and brochures made, but a staff member had sketched one up which worked just fine. The museum offers a lot of history of Alaska, the natives, the immigrants (Russians and Americans, etc.).",
          "This is a great new museum. There is way more stuff than you can see in one visit; exhibits span the centuries and have a variety of historic items and artifacts. It would be an excellent choice if the weather is not good in Juneau. Fee.",
          "I've visited the old museum several times and loved it, but this place is a huge step forward modernization. The store and cafe weren't open yet, but the exhibits were lots of fun and very interesting. You coud spend hours here. Good for all ages.",
          "This museum has been closed for about 3 years to expand and rebuild and just reopened this spring. It is awesome!! There is so much history here in Juneau, from the first settlement of the various Indian tribes, the gold rush times, World War II . They have incredible",
          "I am so glad I took the time to go there. I expected to be in and out but ended up staying over two hours (and would've stayed longer if I could). There are wonderful exhibits on the history of Alaska and the interaction between the different cultures. This museum is a \"must",

          "If you have any interest in culture or history, you don't want to miss this. We had some extra time in Juneau so my wife talked me into going to the new museum she had heard about. We proceeded to spend the next two hours looking at very good exhibits and could have spent more",
          "The museum has been close for a while and recently opened a couple of months ago. It's a small collection of history and art. They have two galleries. One is art including photos through the years by locals. The other is the more larger collection of artifacts throughout",
          "Apparently brand new, no restaurant yet. $12 to get in, have privet locker room for bags. We are been lot's of museum being from Europe and travelled all over US, this is one of the best. Not only artifacts, but explonations stories, history. Learned a lot and we though we knew",

          "This is a brand new museum - just opened this month. I really enjoyed my visit. The exhibits are very well laid out and the photographs of each item on display along with their description and historical info are such a good idea - it makes it so easy to identify what you are",
          "Had some great exhibits.Had some really good native exhibit along with mining information.Also had a small art area.Well worth your time",
          "The museum just reopened the week before we arrived after 3 years of a total renovation of the building. Very impressive the artifacts on display. Close to town so anyone on a cruise ship can easily walk to the museum. The tour around the exhibits shows the history of Alaska",
          "Plan on spending upwards of 3 hours if you really want to dig into the displays and LEARN stuff about Alaska. As an Alaskan I got an annual pass so I can go back on a rainy day and visit often. There are interesting historic events including one of my favorite unknown events",
          "This is not a huge museum, but the artifacts of the native people are well displayed and have plenty of information. When we visited the museum had only been open a few days (no gift shop in June of 2016) and was not busy. We were there for about 1.5 hours, and could have used",

          "I went here with my two boys (7 and 10) a week after the grand opening. This is a beautiful new building and we all enjoyed the exhibits. The staff have done a great job of providing not only interesting items, but also excellent descriptions of each. Looking forward to",
          "It just re-opened a week ago after a rebuild. Great exhibits on Native Alaskan groups, WW II, mining, taxidermy animals and a modern Alaskan art exhibit at the moment. Too new to have a gift shop or restaurant yet. Watch out for taxi drivers collecting too much $! The town is",
          "We toured the museum the same week it re-opened. There are absolutely incredible displays of Native Alaskan art and lifestyles. Learn about the different types of boats, depending on tribe and usage. Learn about the many different tribes who thrive in the Alaskan environment.",
          "This is one of my favorite museums in Alaska! It is just a short walk from where the cruise ships dock, and you can shop along the way. They just have real life displays of the history of Alaska & Juneau. Well worth whatever it costs. I have been to visit it at least 6 times",
          "If you are interested in Alaska history, Alaskan art or modern museology, this museum is well worth a visit. The displays are imaginative, informative, and interestingly arranged. It is somewhat difficult for a relatively small museum to serve to entertain historically,",

          "Great museum but there was construction going on when we were there. I'm sure it will be even greater when the construction is complete. Well worth the nominal charge.",
          "This is a great museum that highlights different time periods and key events in Alaska's history. From native life to gold mining to sustainable fisheries, there are movies, panoramic scenes and historical artifacts for review. Allow at least one hour for a walk through and",
          "It was ok, but nothing overly amazing. I would watch the video which was interesting. This is right downtown.",

          "This is a nice little museum- takes maybe 2 hours tops. I enjoyed the natural history and Alaska native history sections. There very nice animal specimens and many native arts and artifacts. The museum's contemporary art section is definitely not a strong point.",
          "The museum is being torn town and replaced with a bigger and better one but not until 2016. Construction zone all around the museum. Stay away.",
          "We really wanted to go but drove by only to find out that it was closed for renovations until 2016. We had to go down to the Red Dog Saloon instead :-)",
          "Wanted to kill some time and check if it`s worth to go... and it`s definitely worth to spend 1-2 hours nature, history, geography and... very well designed Native section! 6 or 8 $. I `ll go next time.",
          "bummer this was on the top pf my to do list. We had sporadic internet action but I don;t think this was showing closed on the website. I asked the busdriver on the way to Mendenhall and she said it was closed.",
          "Often overlooked by cruisers, but should definitely be visited. A short walk from the downtown shopping, not crowded. The museum offers a first time visitor to Alaska a fine overview of Alaskan history and heritage of her people. Don't miss it!",
          "The Alaska State Museum is a good place to spend a few hours during a dreary and drizzly Juneau day. Lots of history and artifacts of the early Alaskan life and culture. Even though we are Alaskan, we learned plenty of things we didn't know and enjoyed the displays. Great staff",

          "With a grandiose title of a \"state\" museum one would expect a resplendent display of the cultural and historic uniqueness of the 49th state. The museum seems cramped, the layout disconcerting as their is no natural flow from one small exhibit to the next. There is a childrens",
          "We were on a cruise and wanted to get away from some of the regular touristy attractions and walk about the town a bit, and take in some culture of a different form. We really enjoyed this museum; from the wide variety of displays, to the educational aspects, to the games for",

          "This is a wonderful museum - lots to see and a lot of information of Alaskan history. We spent at least 2 hours looking at everything. Very informative. This is a must see attraction in Juneau",

          "Spent an hour here on a cruiseship stopever. Within easy walking distance to the cruiseship terminal. It is a smaller museum but very interesting. One display was of native weaving and that was lovely. Small gift shop, not much in it. Staff were nice and friendly.",

          "The museum has exceptional Native Alaska exhibits with items from numerous cultures depicting the entire state along with gold rush history and displays from current artists. The exhibits are well done and gave detailed information about each culture. The museum was quite",
          "Of course its a smaller one compared to some cities but you can see the effort and detail put into it. Very friendly staff and a nice gift shop. (check the on sale print rack for cheap but high quality gifts). Perfect size for a quick Cruise tour destination and walking distance",
          "Just got back from my NCL Cruise to Alaska. I am not a Museum fan, but this was an excellent Museum to bring the family. The exhibits were well documented and I have an even higher regard for the creativity and ingenuity of the original Native Alaskans and the original",
          "Very good Alaska Native Culture exhibits with items from across the entire state, not just SE Coastal areas. Also some gold rush history, some new works by current artists. Moderate size, very approachable, and good destination in the rain. Opens 8:30am in summer, something",
          "The new exhibits by Tommy Joseph, the carver were wonderful. But the weaving exhibit by Kay Parker was even better. The Ravenstail tunic with sleeves was goregeous.",

          "The Alaska state museum is breathtaking. The lower floor features native Alaskan early history, clothing, hunting implements, weaving, religious practices, masks and robes - it is well documented and beautifully arranged. The walk to the upper floor is a lot of fun, walking",
          "This is a must see while in Juneau. Set aside at least 4-5 hours to get a cursory idea of what Alaska was and is. Native American and Inuit history, mining and commerce were all part of this experience.",
          "What a great place to find in Juneau. I had a day to explore Juneau before getting on an \"uncruise\" ship. So I choose this museum and planned to spend an hour. After two hours, I still did not see everything but I had to leave for the organ recital at noon in the State",
          "Interesting exhibits of Alaska mining, history, and nature. We spent several hours there. Staff was helpful with local info.",
          "One of the nicer state museums we have seen. Good mix of natural history and history of the development of Alaska.",
          "What a significant and splendid tribute to the people of Alaska. This museum has a great section displaying indigenous cultural aspects of the various Alaskan peoples. It has a special emphasis on the Russian period of Alaska\u2019s early",
          "Wonderful well laid out museum explaining Alaska's history, arts, culture and environment. We spent an hour inside but could easily have spent more time.",
          "The museum showed a video about the first two towns that really established Alaska economically, and historically. You also get to see different artifacts that were used in the Gold Rush in Alaska",
          "I concur with fellow Trip Advisor recommendations that visitors should plan to spend a few hours learning and savoring the extensive exhibits.Wtnessing the ingenuity and artistry of the native people was indeed impressive. We were pleased but surprised that photos of all",
          "Went here before a week long cruise. It is 2 floors, with native history and a Russian section. It is small enough to get around in an hour, but you can spend more time if a particular part interests you more. Well worth a visit.",
          "Wow. there is so much in this little museum (which may be about to be closed for renovation--check their website). the permanent exhibits on native cultures and the history of Alaska are terrific. there was an incredible temporary exhibit of revived native weaving/patterns of",

          "My wife and I spent about 3 hours on a guided tour of the Alaska State Museum. The docent was excellent and we learned a lot about Native Americans of Alaska, the flora and the fauna of the State. The stories the docent shared with us about how the Native Americans learned to",
          "Excellent small museum. Contains thousands of artifacts which are carefully explained and offer insight into the lives of the first peoples to have lived in the area. Outstanding display of kayaks, clothing, and hand made items. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "My husband and I loved it. The exhibits were very well documented. We were under some time constraints or we would have lingered longer. We bought some excellent books in the book store. We recommend it.",
          "This museum had a good presentation of Native American artifacts & culture. I enjoyed it very much, learned a lot, there is a ton of information. Definitely worth an hour or two, but then I like anthropology & native american stuff. They do a very good job on the Alaska",
          "A nice museum tucked a few blocks from the cruise ship docks - worth stopping in if you have the time. Their exhibits ranged from detailed Native Alaskan artifacts (not just from SE AK, but from all over the state) to history of European involvement to modern art created by",
          "Although it's not a very large museum, there is a wealth of information and wonderful artifacts in the Alaska State Museum. We could easily have spent twice as much time here (and we did spend at least 2 hours) and still not have done justice to it all. The first-floor exhibit",
          "We enjoyed the Anchorage Museum but were told this is better. For me its a line ball. Both have excellent sections showcasing indigenous culture. This one deals better with the Russian era in Alaska. Anchorage deas better with the history and importance of flight in opening up",
          "Great for a rainy day! This museum was very interesting- almost as good as the state muse on Anchorage. Great collection of totems. Natural history and Alaskan history parts were the best- I didn't enjoy the modern art display as much.",
          "Some cruisers may be attraction-weary and wallet depleted after their cruise berths in Juneau. We were done with our Alaska Zipline (separate review) by noon and I had 4 hours until the ship sailed. So I started a walkabout, first stopping in the tourist information center",
          "This museum is about the native Alaska people more than anything else. I don't think I saw anything about the gold rush. However, the artifacts and exhibits relative to the Alaskan natives was outstanding. Not to be missed.",
          "Easy stroll from the cruise ships and therefore ideal to get away. A unexpectedly excellent place with loads of interest especially the 24 hour globe, could spend all day there! Well laid out and not overwhelming, we learnt a lot about Alaska",
          "This museum was a wonderful overview of the history and culture of Alaska. It answered questions about the Russian American period, explained some of the important stories of the population, and had some impressive art pieces. I was amazed at the basket weaving with rye, what",
          "This is a small, but very well curated museum. It has fascinating exhibits on local culture, artistic innovation, natural history, and the settlement of Alaska. It's an excellent introduction to many facets of Alaska. It's also not really very far from the tour boat docks.",
          "IF you are passing it is worth the small entrance fee. Typical Alaska museum with lots to see. 1-2 hours maximum",
          "Enjoyed a couple of hours here browsing through the exhibits. Covers history and culture of native people as well as Russians, European explorers, and U.S. purchase of Alaska. Lots of interesting items to see. A nice break from expensive excursions/tours and endless tourist",
          "The museum is a great place to get a broad overview of the history of Alaska, its regions, and the people that populate them. We spent about 1-1/2 hours browsing the exhibits. Admission was $7/pp for adults.",
          "We had done some tours in Juneau before, so this time we just went to the State Museum. It was pretty interesting if you like that sort of thing -- lots of history on pre-European, Russian and U.S. eras.",
          "Excellent but a long walk to get there . Displays well laid out and if you want you can take the guided tour.",
          "This is a great museum and not so overwhelming that you can't enjoy it in an hour or so. Also seemed to have hands-on activities for kids -- that I just walked by. The circular walk-up past a central diorama is great.",
          "Wonderful presentations of historical artifacts from Native, Russian and United States Control. We spent about 1.5 hours going through the museum and had a wonderful time.",
          "Unfortunately, we docked in Juneau on a holiday and the museum was closed. I was really looking forward to learning more and going through this museum. I personally don't think museums should be closed just because it is a holiday. That is the time when more people could",
          "Easy to walk to, it was just behind the hotel. An excellent variety of artifacts and displayed nicely. It will be closed for a while because they are adding on to the facility.",
          "Nice and interesting museum to visit for 3 bucks. A good introduction to the culture of Alaskan natives.",
          "You can easily kill an hour in here, maybe a little more. Lots of history about the local native tribes. For three dollars you literally cannot go wrong. There are some very neat displays of the hunting techniques that the Native Americans used historically. There are some",
          "Don't miss this. This is a small museum by most standards, but that makes it possible to enjoy the whle thing without getting exhausted. It's conveniently located downtown, and is packed with the most interesting and important information and exhibits about local peoples and",
          "Especially interesting to me were the exquisite baskets on display. I saw some extremely fine woven examples.",
          "I had an extra day on my own and went to the Alaska Museum. It was not only very well put together, but there was hardly anyone there so I didn't feel rushed or overcrowded. Interesting history that you can only find in a museum.",
          "With the emphasis on aboriginal works, this museum stand proud. There does seem to be a limited selection (for the area and especially the State), but it is nonetheless worth the admission and more. An expanded gift shop might pay for more acquisition and I would like to see",
          "This is a small museum. Their native artifact collection mixes historical and modern pieces in the same case - very odd curation. The Anchorage museum has a better collection by far, both native art and modern white history. Except if you are in Juneau, stop here anyway if",
          "We had a blast here! The kids got in free and so did my husband b/c he is active duty military. We only paid $3 for admission for me. It's always great to find a place to go that doesn't cost a fortune. The kids had a blast in the kids area. They offered lots of hands on",
          "This is the state museum and I enjoyed the visit it has some great displays of Alaska history and animals as well. The museum is not too big and well laid out. It does have a long very gradual spiral ramp to get to the upstairs and I am not sure of an elevator so handicapped",
          "The giant globe, stuffed animals along the ramp to the top, the boat is fun for kids, hands on displays for kids, art work displays change regularly so there's always something new, lots of local Native culture",
          "Take the time to see this museum. Juneau is a lovely town, with lots of interesting nooks and crannies and you shouldn't miss out on her charms!",
          "The Tlingit and Inuit Indians of Alaska were ingenious carvers, seamstresses, and survivors. All of their handmade items are on display in the Alaska State Museum! - a fascinating place to visit!",
          "Their exhibits are usually interesting to go see, photographs from various indiduals, photographs of different seaweeds, even a lecture on the subject of seaweeds was given. Their gift shop has some beautiful art crafts that is worthy of purchase for those with an interest and",
          "This museum has different themes on each floor. Great historical displays for mining and early Juneau and early Alaska. The bottom floor has an ever changing display featuring Alaskana themes.",
          "Not a huge museum, but very informative -- a nice leisurely visit will give you a lot of information about the state and it's history.",
          "Great museum, with a very good displays of Alaska in WWII and of native artifacts. One thing they have now is a show by an artist who has a very droll sense of humor. It takes a while moving around the show to understand what he is doing, but when you do it is hard not to",
          "As far as museums go, it is smaller than a lot, but does have a good reflection of life in Alaska. The best part is the wildlife display with the real stuffed animals.",
          "We went to the Museum from our cruise ship. The costs was cheap, he video show of the First People was great and the layout and exhibits were very good. It was pleasant and informative. The gift shop was also nice, with lots of selections for such a small place. We recommend",
          "It was right next to our hotel after a 7 day adventure cruise and a good couple of hours of history and culture for the whole family. The highlight was a special exhibit on World War II which our 10 year old son loved",
          "Definitely not a bad way to spend a few hours in Juneau. It comes as a part of a package if I remember correctly. You get an insight into the heart of Alaska and its origins. While it is not that big itself, the museum encompasses wild-life sculptures, art work, and a decent",
          "We really enjoyed this museum because the exhibits were well planned and maintained and we learned a lot about the area. We especially enjoyed the eagle exhibit, but they had everything from World War II to the mining industry on display.",

          "Walked in the rain to reach the museum. Lockers were available to store your packs and clothes rack for jackets. Beautiful \"wilderness\" display of bear and eagles. Very detailed exhibit of native's artifacts. Informative showing of the Japanese invasion. This museum gave us",

          "It doesn't take more than a hour to see all the exhibits in this museum but none the less they are interesting and show what the state is really about. I recommend this museum.",
          "We decided to skip the cruise ship excursions and explore Juneau on our own. One of our stops was the Alaska State Museum. We spent about 1.5hrs in the museum which was enough. The WWII exhibit was very interesting and well done especially the scavenger hunt they had for the",
          "I'm sure that over 90% of visitors to Juneau, Alaska get there by way of a cruise ship. Because of the generic tourist shops and variety of over priced excursions, I'd also venture a guess that most visitors miss the two best sites in Juneau - the Alaska State Museum and the",
          "Juneau is a small city as as the State Capital teh local State Museum is small by comparison to other similar museums. But it is informative and has some good displays. I found the WWII area the most interesting. 1-2 hours is more than enough time to see the place.",
          "You must make the time to visit the Alaska State Museum the next time (or the FIRST time!) you are in Juneau. The exhibits are excellent. The museum is really well pulled together. Very worth the time!",
          "A great intro to the local fauna, culture and history. Small enough that you can take it all in without getting \"museum feet\". Allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
          "Not a large museum but well worth a visit. There is a permanent exhibit of native animals (a great place to get a close up of a brown bear and an eagle\u2019s nest) plus interesting displays of native and European art. A current exhibit is an interesting display and discussion of",

          "This museum has a lot of stuff packed into it, but it is on the small side. I liked the tribal art work there. It was interesting but not overly exciting.",
          "We really liked everything about the first floor of this museum, which featured Alaska's wartime history and it's native peoples. But we were disappointed at the rest of the museum and felt it left out a great deal of information about the logging and fishing industries, so",
          "This is a very nice museum and well laid out. They have a whole exhibit on the Alaskan contribution to the second world war. I had no idea the Japanese had landed there until our visit to the museum. There are lots of examples of native handicrafts as well. All in all, it's",
          "We really enjoyed seeing the exhibits though we did think perhaps it was a bit pricey. Still interesting and nicely exhibited animals and artifacts of Alaska.",
          "Yes, seniors gripe about costs - but how about a $5 entry fee for those over 65 - but considering how well the exhibits are maintained, the double cost was well worth the walk from town. And, by walk - how about 1/2 mile? Don't miss this visit - great place to learn about",

        "wiki": "The Juneau mining district is a gold mining area in the U.S. state of Alaska.\nIn 1880 a local inhabitant, Chief Kowee, revealed to prospectors Joe Juneau and Richard Harris the presence of gold in what is now named Gold Creek in Silver Bow Basin. The city of Juneau was founded there that year.\nThe strike sparked the Juneau gold rush which resulted in the development of many placer and lode mines including the largest, in their time, gold mines in the world: the Treadwell complex of lode mines on Douglas Island (across a narrow sea channel from Juneau) and the AJ lode mine, in Juneau itself. The steep, wet, timber-covered, seaside mountain setting  provided water power, transportation, and lumber such that, \"extraordinarily low costs of operation make available low grade ore that under conditions only slightly different would be valueless.\"The first claims of what was to become the Treadwell complex were staked in 1881. Mining the Treadwell site began by sluicing residual placers over the lode deposits. Underground mining began with a five-stamp mill operating in 1883. In the mid-1910s, with 960 stamps grinding ore and tunnels reaching as far as 2,400 feet (730 m) below the surface and extending under the sea, Treadwell was one of the most technologically advanced mines of its day. Up to 2000 people worked at the mine before a collapse allowed the rising tide to flood the tunnels in 1917. All operations at the Treadwell ceased by 1922.As the Treadwell mines declined and closed, the AJ (Alaska Juneau) mine rose in prominence. After years of losses and labor problems, the mine became profitable in the mid-1920s: with 600 workers it was setting production records. Through the decade, it was the main economic engine of Juneau. In the 1930s, with 1000 workers, it was an important factor in softening the impact upon Juneau of the Great Depression.Economic pressures of WWII lead to the closure of the AJ in 1944; this was the end of the dominance of mining in the Juneau economy.Although those two mines are long-since closed, as late as 2010 one of the hydropower plants built to power the AJ was still in use. Fires and time have destroyed most traces of the Treadwell complex; the AJ mine buildings were burned by vandals and little can be seen by visitors these days because of the growth of alders.\nThe Juneau mining district; comprising the area between the Canada\u2013US border, Lynn Canal, Admiralty Island, and Frederick Sound, has produced over 7 million ounces of lode gold and 80,000 ounces of placer gold.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeriod of 1869\u20131921\n\nThe year 1869 was historic in Alaskan history as it marked the first discovery of gold tracers at Powers Creek and Windham Bay, which resulted in the first gold production in Alaska. The initiative to establish mines were from Treadwell and Alaska Juneau establishments and  both became large mining complexes. The emphasis in the initial stages was to extract gold from on gold tracer deposits. However, in the early 1880s, importance shifted to Lode deposits. In 1881, in order to increase production the Treadwell (They were a complex of three firms with four mines) established their first stamp mills in Silver Bow Basin and production started rising, particularly of lode extraction. John Treadwell (1842\u20131927) a Canadian gold miner owned and operated the Treadwell gold mine through the Treadwell Mining Company. He was responsible for initiating low-grade gold mining in Alaska adopting most advanced operations on a big scale, which boosted the economy of the wilderness areas. His four mines formed the largest complex in the world at that time. Treadwell's mine complex \"put Juneau on the map\".The Alaska Mill and Mining Company was established in May 1882. Explorations on an experimental basis included a five-stamp mill. The results proved profitable and the company expanded with a bigger sized 120-stamp mill in 1883 and another in 1887. In the initial years, the Treadwell Complex had four mines (Treadwell, Ready Bullion, the Mexican and the Seven-Hundred-Foot)) and five mills. The gold yield was worth about US$70 million.\nDuring 1890 to 1915, many smaller mines came to be established in addition to the major players in the field. the smaller mines were: the Sumdum Chief, the Crystal, Comet, Jualin, Silver Queen, and Eagle River mines. Production figures of  Treadwell complex (including the Treadwell, 700 Foot, Mexican, and Ready Bullion Mines) peaked to a record production record of 5,000 short tons (st) of ore every day. However, by 1917 the smaller miles folded up and Treadwell had sudden closure of operation due to a major mining accident in which their mines got flooded; a cave in occurred and the sea water flooded the mines. After this incident they traded in Ready Bullion. However, the old Perseverance Mine got reestablished as the Alaska Gastineau Co, adopted innovative techniques for mining by adopting ball mills pattern that had been successfully  adopted in the porphyry copper ore extracted in the American southwest. Their production peaked for a time and then went down due to problems to the mines and mining. They closed their mines in 1921. Treadwell had ended producing about 3.1 million oz gold from ore that averaged 0.13 oz/st gold by the time they ended their operations.\nPeriod 1915\u20131921The Alaska Juneau Mine, however, were successful, after overcoming  initial teething troubles, to increase their production using the same innovative technique which the Alaska Gastineau Co had used. The use of ball mill for ore grinding became a success and they could extract 12,000 short tons of ore per day. Their profit was reported as an average of 0.04 oz/st gold.\nPeriod 1921\u20131944Between 1930 and early 1940s, the Alaska Juneau Mine became the largest and lowest-grade gold mine in the world and also were the largest in lead producers. However World War II, the inflation that followed  and a fixed price for gold could not sustain their operations and they closed their mines in 1944. Their operations resulted in total production of 2.9 million troy ounce (oz) gold, 1.9 million oz silver, and 40 million lbs lead.\nPeriod 1970\u20131985Since the late 1970s, with gold prices rising to $600-$800 an oz, many claims were staked again. Old prospects and mines were reexamined but did not proceed further than that. It was only in 1985, that efforts were made to reestablish the old great Alaska Juneau Mine.The yield from the Mines in the Juneau Gold Belt during the period 1980\u201383 was worth $157,000,000 from 6.7 million oz gold, 3.1 million oz silver, and 45 million lbs lead.\nPeriod 1985\u2013Since 1985, many mining establishments are examining possibilities of restarting some of the mines like the great Alaska Juneau Mine. Alaska Mining Centre undertook the reevaluation study of the old mines under the Bureau of Mines, as part of the Mineral Land Assessment Program in the Juneau Mining District. This study by the Bureau covered about 85 mines from where 675 samples were collected to examine the further prospects. For the purposes of studies and sampling, the gold belt was geographically examined in three areas of: a)the Berners Bay, Bessie Mountain, Yankee Basin, and Eagle River areas; b) Spaulding Meadows and the Juneau and Douglas areas; and c) Areas south from Taku Inlet to Holkam Bay.\n\n\n== Mines ==\n\n\n=== Treadwell mine ===\n\nFrench Canadian prospector Pierre Erussard, known as \"French Pete,\" found gold on Douglas Island, across Gastineau Channel from Juneau.  A consortium led by John Treadwell, a carpenter from California, purchased the claims and adjoining gold-bearing land. The resulting mine/mill complex produced more than 3 million troy ounces (93 tonnes) of gold before closing in 1922.\n\n\n=== Kensington & Jualin mines ===\nThe underground Kensington hardrock mine is approximately 45 miles (72 km) north of Juneau. The mine site is within the City and Borough of Juneau and the Tongass National Forest.\nDevelopment and ore production occurred at the Kensington mine site from 1897 through 1938. The adjacent, also underground, Jualin mine was discovered in 1895 and operated from 1896 to 1928.  Together the mines produced 40,513 ounces of gold from 75,208 tons of ore.\nInterest in the dormant mines was renewed during the 1980s and 1990s. The Kensington Project is now in the final stages of permitting. The proposed underground mine will produce approximately 2,000 tons of ore per day and 400 tons per day of development rock over an estimated 10 years. The project now encompasses both the Kensington and Jualin prospects. The proposed mine, access roads, and tailings disposal areas are located on federal land overseen by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), State of Alaska tidelands, and on private patented property. The project will employ approximately 300 to 400 people during the 22 months required for construction of the facilities and 225 full-time employees to operate the mine and processing facilities. The operation will use a froth flotation process which involves crushing the ore then flooding the ore with water containing chemicals which combine with gold, float to the surface, and are skimmed off.\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a 6-3 decision which ruled that the United States Army Corps of Engineers had properly issued a permit allowing mine slurry, crushed rock mixed with water, to be discharged as \"fill\" into Lower Slate Lake, a 23-acre (93,000 m2) lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet (15 m). The Environmental Protection Agency deferred to the decision of the Corps of Engineers with respect to the discharge of waste into the lake, issuing a permit for discharge of treated water from the lake. While waste is being discharged into the lake surface waters are routed around it. A dam will be built to impound water as the original lake is filled by waste, the area of the lake being enlarged to 50 acres (200,000 m2) over the life of the project. At the termination of the project the bottom of the lake will be coated with native material and the lake restocked. The alternative to use of the lake for waste disposal was building of tailing ponds which would have displaced wetlands. Enlargement of the lake will produce additional wetlands, at least according to the majority opinion in the Supreme Court case. Environmental groups maintain that this decision was made possible by an administrative rule change made by the Bush administration:The Clean Water Act allows \"fill material\" to be put into waters for constructive purposes such as the creation of levees, seawalls, and the like, under permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers. For decades the regulatory definition of \"fill material\" expressly excluded waste, meaning the Army Corps could not permit waste dumps in waters. In 2002 the Bush administration changed the definition of \"fill\" so that most solid material, including waste and contaminated materials, could be placed into waterways. In the Kensington Mine case, the Bush administration expanded its interpretation of the rule, through an informal EPA memo that was never subject to public notice or comment, to allow dumping of toxic, industrial wastewater slurries directly into lakes and other water bodies, a practice that had long been prohibited by EPA rules. The Court based its ruling on this informal memo.\nThe rule could be overturned by pending legislation, The Clean Water Protection Act, H.R. 1310, amending the Clean Air Act sponsored by Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Dave Reichert (R-WA) and 151 cosponsors. Also a new or amended rule could be adopted or the informal memo withdrawn. A related controversy, also involving mining, and affected by the same rule change, is the practice of Mountaintop removal mining which involves dumping overburden into stream beds in adjacent valleys.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGold mining in Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"High court to hear dispute over Alaska gold mine\" by Matthew Daly, Associated Press, January 12, 2009.",

          "I think anyone who enjoys small local museums would enjoy visiting this museum. I watched the 30 minute video, which was much more interesting than I thought it would be. I spent an additional 1/2 hour looking at the museum exhibits, the special art exhibit & reading the 1958",

          "This museum is within a short walking distance of the capital building. It is fairly small, but has plenty of interesting local history. I didn't have time to watch the video, but the displays were very informative. They have displays on the native Alaskan history as well as",
          "Some locals at a sandwich shop recommended this quaint little museum to us as a \"must do\" something indoors to do on a damp afternoon. We enjoyed watching the very informative film about local history in their little \"theatre\" room. They have several nicely done displays of the",

        "wiki": "Google Street View was first introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007, and until November 26, 2008, featured camera icon markers, each representing at least one major city or area (such as a park), and usually the other nearby cities, towns, suburbs, and parks. Many areas that had coverage were represented by icons.\n\n\n== Key additions ==\n\nOn May 25, 2007, Street View was announced.\nOn May 30, 2007, at the Where 2.0 Conference, Immersive Media was identified as the contractor that captured the imagery for four of the five cities initially mapped by Street View, using its patented dodecahedral camera array on a moving car. Immersive Media continued to do image capture for Street View until Google developed its own capability to do so. Since July 2007, Google has used imagery that belongs exclusively to Google.\nOn April 16, 2008, Street View was fully integrated into Google Earth 4.3.\nOn May 12, 2008, Google announced that it was testing face-blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan. The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google's image database for faces and blurs them, according to John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Google Maps.\nOn June 10, 2008, two other features included in the update were an effective mask of the \"Google Car\" and the application of face-blurring technology on all photos, which effectively lowered the resolution across all photos, even the formerly impressive high resolution images of San Francisco. Also, many nearby metro areas were included, but they did not receive their own camera icons.\nOn July 2, 2008, Google Street View was introduced in France and Italy, providing the first service outside the United States and the debut of Google's new 4th Generation Cameras. On this day, 19 camera icons were added, mostly showing small towns and areas along the Tour de France route and part of northwestern Italy.\nOn August 4, 2008, 28 icons of major metropolitan areas of both Australia and Japan were added to Google Street View. Included in the update were approximately 40 new U.S. hub cities.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Street View button and all the camera icons were deleted. Instead of clicking the \"Street View\" button, this is now accessed using the \"pegman\" button in the left hand corner. When the \"pegman\" icon is dragged over the map blue polylines appear where Street View is available and a small window will show the current Street View. If this is dropped on the map the Street View opens and takes over the whole map window.\nOn December 1, 2008, New Zealand was added to Google Street View. Faces were blurred upon recommendation by the New Zealand Privacy Commission, but vehicle registration plates were not obscured.\nOn April 9, 2009, Street View became available with a full-screen option.\nOn June 5, 2009, Smart Navigation was introduced which allows users to navigate around the panoramas by double-clicking with their cursor on any place or object they want to see.\nIn mid-June 2010, Google added blue dots to its maps that display user-submitted images in all locations around the world, including land areas where Street View is not available and bodies of water. These images can be pulled up on the screen in the same manner as a Street View image with the pegman by dragging it onto the blue dot.\nOn October 30, 2012, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn February 14, 2013, Wii Street U was released for the Wii U.\nOn June 27, 2013, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy non-Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn April 23, 2014, a new historical Street View option was introduced to new Google Maps. The date of panoramas can be selected from the timeline.\nStarting in August 2017, Google allows users to create their own street view-like blue paths, for the connected photospheres that are sufficiently close to one another.\n\n\n== Timeline of introductions ==\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n* Limited coverage.\n\n\n== Coverage by country \u03bfr territory ==\nBelow is a table showing the countries available on Street View and the year they were first added. Plain text indicates that a country has only views of certain businesses and/or tourist attractions.\n\n\n=== Current coverage ===\nBold with an asterisk (*) indicates countries with public street view available\n\n\n=== Future coverage ===\nBelow is list of the countries that do not currently have official coverage where Street View vehicles are currently driving, where Street View is officially planned, or have reported by media to be driving.\nPublic streets in Guernsey and India (Bangalore), as well more places in Germany were filmed but at this time the images are not online due to some privacy concerns.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStreet View coverage map and current driving locations\nAvailable indoor views of public transportation facilities as airports and railway stations and transportation museums\nAvailable inside views of university campuses",

          "This is an interesting place and has an interesting story. Didn't realize it was a re-mediated landslide area plus most of it is part of the forest system vs. private land. The upsidedown trees are cool but many were left unfinished or not planted yet with flowers. I expected it",
          "Be very mindful of the time of year you visit the gardens. Our May 2019 experience was terrible from when we boarded the public bus system to the entry of the gardens. The $2 bus seems easy enough but the bus drivers and directions are non existant. We had a bad experience with",
          "An interesting garden and the history behind the formation of the garden. Upside down trees with the root balls filled with flowers. Visit the sales room and see the many decorative umbrellas hanging from the ceiling",
          "The upside down trees are very cool, and it was a nice tour. It's a bit slow to get started with the tour, as everyone has to ride on a large golf cart, and the line is long.",
          "I took my Norwegian Cruise Line Alaska trip on the week of May 12-19 and my trip to the Glacial Gardens in Juneau was disappointing due to being too early for any flowers to have bloomed. The grounds are very unique and if the flowers had been in bloom, it would have been",
          "An odd way to present a garden. They planted trees upside down so the roots were pointing upwards. Then they planted flowers in the roots. Weird but very effective. The trees were pushed down from a mudslide a few years ago. Liked the hanging baskets of flowers inside as well.",
          "Lovely tranquil and relaxing gardens with great views and the opportunity to see an eagle on a live video feed as well as take photos of it as it flew back and forth from its best! Obviously more flowers etc would have been there a little later in the season as we were there",
          "Beautiful gardens but it wasn't yet open for the season. But the owner was very nice to let us wander around the property.",
          "Very beautiful gardens. The tram ride up the mountain was very scenic, and very informative. Great guides, conveniently located.",
          "This was one tour I really did not want to go on, but so glad I was overruled! These are gardens that were made with love and patience. There is an excellent tram ride through the gardens. My sister is in a wheelchair and they were more than accommodating!",
          "When we went in May it was just opening for the summer season. We ended up with a private tour. And our guide was great.",
          "We drove here with our rental car. It is on the way back to Juneau from Mendenhall Glacier. There are 50 acres of rainforest, ponds, waterfall, a greenhouse with plants and cafe, but the best part by far is the view at the top. They give you about 20 minutes at the top to",
          "Glacier Gardens is a must see while in Juneau! The fauna and flora are amazing! unlike anything you have seen before! Steve and Cindy have made it a true Rainforest Adventure!",
          "If you've been to Juneau before and seen most of the sights, try Glacier Gardens. Surprisingly beautiful and interesting gardens reclaimed after a landslide. Upside down trees are not to be missed. A peaceful and inexpensive tour!",
          "Whenever I visit Juneau with friends I love showing them this beautiful garden created by a local family. The famous upside-down trees and plants are a must see. On this recent trip, I brought my in-laws who are gardeners. I was extremely disappointed with the rude behavior of",
          "This was a tour organized by the cruise ship line and it was a unexpected marvel. The work and planning that has gone into these gardens is wonderful. It was a really enjoyable couple of hours. The gift shop is full of great gifts for family and friends. The garden guides",
          "Denali is a Great bus tour guide, he had so many great stories and information about the local Native Americans from the area Everyone who worked there was so polite and informative....even the young people. I highly recommend stopping in, The bus lets you off at the top",
          "Arriving in Juneau by cruise ship means you have a brief time to explore the area. This place is easily accessible by bus - have the right cash ready. Some of the cultivated plants were past their best but the golf cart trip through the rain forest proved an insightful",
          "One of the most memorable experiences on our Alaska adventure was the precipitous bus ride from the carefully tailored garden to the Tongass Natural Forest. We entered the forest on a rainy day, and though we got a bit damp, we certainly had an authentic rainforest experience.",
          "A little tour for the tour van driver to find and enter -- we passed it up and then he scraped something as we entered. Later heard he may have entered the wrong entrance. It was a chilly drizzly day and it was a bit rushed. I was surprised that our small tour group walked",
          "The Bohay's opened Glacier Gardens Rainforest Adventure in 1998 after years of rehabilitating a storm damaged stream that runs through their 50 acres of property. Glacier Rainforest Adventure is a unique botanical garden. Enjoy the garden.",
          "Glacier Garden was great! We had reviewed their website before we went and their eagle cam was a bonus. We have mating pairs on a lake nearby in Southern Illinois but to a actually watching the eagles l estate up close was phenomenal. The garden was such a surprise. To see",
          "We booked this tour - which included the Mendenhall Glacier - via our cruiseship, Royal Caribbean Explorer of the Seas. The descriptions led us to believe that the garden itself was much larger and the 'tour' would be longer. Both were exaggerated and embellished to quite a",
          "Not sure I would have made the stop except it was part of the 'highlights' tour. A bit tough to find -- tour van missed it on first pass.",
          "I'm not exactly a plant person, but I enjoyed learning about and seeing all the flowers and trees. Cody was very informative and funny as he led us up the tramway. It is such a great little stop on a wonderfully sunny day. The view from the top is worth the price of admission",
          "I'm a flower hiking rain forest lover so I always do these kind of things... This was pretty cool & unique. The guy pulls out trees turns em updise down and then uses em as flower pots. Brilliant. and hey now you can get busloads of people to visit! :)",
          "This property has a very dedicated staff: All the plants are placed on the upside-down dead trunks during the summer and then put in the greenhouses during the winter - so much work! The place is a flower-lovers paradise. You ride in a golf cart up the mountain to the overlook.",
          "Our ship was the only one in Juneau so we had the Glacier Gardens to ourselves. Matt provided an excellent tour or the loverly gardent and rainforest. We purchased delicious hot tea and souvenirs.",
          "The pictures you see on the internet are real and that part of the garden is quite impressive however it is quite small. We were expecting much more throughout the property. We had a guided trolley ride through the property which was informative but really just visiting a",
          "We went to the gardens as part of our glacier tour. The gardens are beautiful and they provide a tram ride up the hill to an overlook of Juneau. Our driver was very knowledgeable about the area. The upside down flower towers were amazing. The flowers were beautiful. There",
          "What an amazing experience. Our tour guide did awesome and was full of knowledge. Would definitely return. :) thank you for sharing.",
          "Went here as part of shore excursion and glad we did. Beautiful plants, little tram ride up so that you can see a wonderful view. They had an eagles nest that you could see but even better they had put a camera on it with viewing in the coffee shop. I must say the one coffee",
          "The gardens are well named -- except for the \"Adventure\" portion. You ride up a very steep grade through the forest to the top of the mountain and a lovely look-out over Juneau and glaciers. Then, you ride down again. A staff member does the driving, and narrates the geology,",
          "The tram tour and visitor center were both wonderful. The rainforest is absolutely beautiful and our tour guide was very informational! Definitely recommend stopping here!",
          "Wonderful views (it was sunny), good explanations of the forest ecosystem. Friendly employees. Quite an accomplishment for a private individual to have built it.",
          "Absolutely Stunning! We went as part of a tour group and were So Happy that we got to see this. The guides are Wonderful and the trip up the mountain (and back down again) is completely Magnificent! Don't miss this one when you are in Juneau!",
          "Lovely tour of wooded gardens leading to the top of the mountain with a spectacular view! We would definitely do this again.",
          "Loved the gardens and the tour however the Carol at the beginning made it hard for us all to enjoy the remaining part of the tour. Carol was extremely rude and treated us very poorly. I almost took my family and left but I was determined not to allow her to have that power. I'm",
          "Very nice garden and beautiful view when we were at the top. Tour guide was very informative on the way up and down.",
          "So beautiful. We had a private driver and arrived right when they opened ahead of the buses. Very relaxing and wonderful site. The climate makes for amazing floral and fauna.",
          "Just a unique beautiful garden with upside-down trees used for different floral arrangements. We had a very informative tour guide who made the ride up to the view-point through the rain forest very interesting.",
          "Such an interesting place. The flowers and landscaping was gorgeous and a the story of how it begin was incredible. If you like flowers I highly recommend this place",
          "It's just a really unique place to visit. They have \"upside-down\" trees you won't see anywhere else. Very pretty and laid out nicely. Educational tour about the rainforest you're driving through and the plants and berries unique to Alaska. Very pleasant tour, I highly recommend",
          "Based on the advertising I expected a large garden and an informative rainforest tour. The gardens was pretty but very small, and the golf cart drive up the road was conducted by a very chatty tour guide who told corny jokes about his wife and kids. I guess I expected to learn",
          "This was better than we expected. The botanical and floral arrangements are designed so well into this temperate rainforest mountainside, that turning almost every corner is a surprise and a delight. We saw things there we've never seen anywhere else (such as botanical gardens",
          "This was a wonderful place to visit on an otherwise miserable day. The gardens were beautiful, and I really liked the umbrella display too! Really good views from the top and the guides were very friendly and knowledgeable too. Most of the staff was helpful, and they have a",
          "These gardens are a true vision of a husband and wife who enjoy the outdoors and the love of the lady. Especially to use of dead trees planted upside down in the ground with exposed root systems holding the most unique arrangements of planting\u2019s to ever be seen. Many of the",
          "First, the bad part. The tour guide we had would make any sailor blush with her language. My rating would be much higher if the operation was more courteous and professional. The second guide we had (a young man) was much better and I wish we had him the whole time. The",
          "The place is so worth a visit. Its amazing how they have turned old trees upside down and planted flowers in them. It is so colourful and nicely presented. You get a ride up the mountain through the rainforest and our guide gave us a lot of information on the place. We had nice",
          "Who knew there is a thriving rain forest in Alaska?!! Most amazing flora and fauna. The air is clear and the scent is refreshing.",
          "I expected more. The garden is interesting but very small. Most of the time is spent riding a golf cart up the mountain through the forest to a look out place and then rode back down. Learned about the forest. Interesting... but would gave preferred something else.",
          "You will absolutely cherish the time you spend at the Glacier Gardens. From the incredible Panorama view of Juneau to the upsidedown tree planters and the great stories form the guides, you will have incredible memories to take home with you and a million pictures of flowers :)",
          "Loved this---It is so beautiful and interesting. My Grand kids, ages 20 and 21 also enjoyed it . We bought our tickets online and took a cab from the port instead of doing an excursion. The guide was great and knowledgeable and did a great tour of the gardens.",
          "The price seems a little high, but not really. The flowers are beautiful. The setting is one of a kind. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and very humorous. The tour is basically a ride climbing 600 feet of winding trails through the rain forest to the top of the hill. Aside from",
          "Yes it was pretty but would not have visited if it weren\u2019t already incorporated into the excursion package. Old tree trunks are flipped upside down and buried deep in the ground then flowers are planted in the base. A little hokey. The best part was the view at the top and also",
          "Interesting spot to see local flora and what one person's dream has accomplished. Upside down trees tipped with flowers is unique",
          "I visited this garden as part of a Juneau tour. I thought it was going to be a time filler but it was a beautiful surprise. The history of the garden is interesting and the use of the land is in response to the history. There is a tram that will take you to the top of the",
          "This stop is pretty, hanging flowers everywhere. The best part of this attraction is the ride to the top of Thunder Mountain. From there you can take some nice photos of Juneau and the glacier mountains in the background. Not sure if i would do it if it wasnt included already",
          "Glacier Gardens is a botanical garden located on the side of a mountain in the Juneau rainforest. The Gardens are famous for the upside down flower trees. The attraction would have been more highly rated but the staff was more interested in driving you as quick as possible up",
          "A must do when in Juneau, the gardens are so well done and the guided tour to the lookout was fantastic. 10/10 to the creator & staff",
          "After spending a few days in Vancouver, and seeing the beautiful shrubs in bloom, flowers all over the place, I expected \"Glacier Gardens\" to be spectacular. Perhaps it is because it was late May, but it was not great. Yes, there were the upside down tree trunks with some flower",
          "the unique tree root flower baskets, the open tram up the rainforest mountain, the views at the top, and the flower and umbrella filled visitor's center (plus the live eagle's nest cam) make this a unique and happily memorable tour.",
          "This is an amazing garden and green house. After a disastrous land slide which took out a large amount of the trees, the owner had a tractor run-in with one of the fallen trees and then turned the tree roots up and stuck it in the ground. And he got an idea. With the roots up",
          "Even though it was a rainy day, we truly enjoyed our visit at these gardens. The owners of these wonderful gardens are very accommodating and friendly. This is a must see for all!!!",
          "very nice place to visit, calming and the guides are very good in telling the history and its family oriented.",
          "Such a lovely place with a great variety of plants, but the price tag is not really worth it. Had a lovely tour but could\u2019ve spent our money elsewhere.",
          "This is an absolute must see and most of the attractions are actually near the ticket counter. They ask you not to click pictures until you have paid for tickets. You pay for a ride to the vista point atop and commentary but the visuals are mostly around the ticket green house",
          "juneau has lots of interest .day trips up the fjords bears seals glacier food available or take your own",
          "Was absolutely beautiful, I recommend the Gardens for everyone. Just make sure u slow down when getting close or you might miss the turn off.",
          "We had booked the helicopter ride to the Mendenhall Glacier and then dog sledding. When our ship pulled into port, they cancelled our ship because of the fog. I was really really disappointed. We opted for this tour and we were pleasantly surprised. The creativity is boundless.",
          "The tour was very interesting and our guide was great! The flowers were amazing! The upside down tree s with flowers on top were very unique.",
          "The gardens are beautiful, and the story of how they came about was very interesting. The trip to the top of the gardens was very unexpected and exciting! We had a great time here, and are so glad our excursion included this stop.",
          "The views and the flowers and plants were breathtaking. The admission price was a little steep, but we still had a good time. The driver/tour guide Chris(?) was charming and knowledgeable. One of the other guides was giving off a real \"cult of Steve\" vibe, but maybe we've just",
          "Beautiful gardens and very informative but I'm not sure that it was worth the money. You get to go all over the mountain in a golf buggy and get a good overview of all the plants. It was lovely but be prepared to pay $26 for an hours tour.",
          "First of all if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful walk through a garden this is NOT your tour. When you enter you will be placed on large golf carts and carried up into the mountain. There are sudden drop offs and although I never felt unsafe, I am afraid of heights and",
          "Included on a tour of Juneau we didn't quite know what to expect. But it is a special slice of the Alaskan rainforest. You are transported through the rainforest with its unique views and plants, including their upside down trees; dead trees stuck in the ground with the roots",
          "We loved the upside down trees planted with annuals. What the owners have done to restore this property is amazing. Visionary and backbreaking.",
          "Visited this rain forest in June 2018. Some highlights of this experience: the park had spectacular view overlooking the Juneau airport at the top of rain forest, the gift shop area had very pretty flowers hanging in the pots at the start of tour. Enjoyed the unusual",
          "The highlight of the tour is literally the upside tree stumps that they have transformed into planters. I took this as part of an excursion off a cruise. We arrived and took a two minute walk basically up to where they put us on large jeep/bus that held about 20 people. A",
          "The flowers are too beautiful to describe! These gardens are spectacular and well worth the time for a visit. There is also a small gift shop and snack bar to visit.",
          "We toured the gardens on Wed. 6/13/18 and had a wonderful time. Our tour guide, Russell, even gave us a short off-road experience as we approached the peak of the mountain. We now call that section of the trail \"Russell's Ridge\". Kudos to the staff and guides for a truly",
          "I was very happy and still am at visiting Glacier Gardens during May 16th. Everyone was welcoming and genuinely kind. Geno and Chris were my tour guides. I enjoyed the beautiful tree gardens and the fresh tempature of the Forest. I am an avid bird watcher and did enjoy the",
          "We were fascinated at the photos of the upside down trees, so we booked this excursion. It was interesting to hear of their reclaiming project and the scenery was beautiful, but not as impressive as I had hoped. I did appreciate the snack bar for a soda, but thought their gift",
          "We took the narrated ride through the forest to the top of the mountain. Our tour guide did excellent job explaining things in the forest and how this place started. When we got to the top of mountain she lets out to see the views and take some pictures. On the way down the",
          "This place is so beautiful and romantic, I had the pleasure of getting down on one knee and asking the girl I love to marry me in front of a beautiful display of flowers. Staff was very accommodating and nice. Will love to visit this place again!!!",
          "So it's been said before but the are upside down trees with plants planted on the bottom/top. That's not all. There are beautiful gardens and a deck that you are brought to via golf cart. Everyone is gracious and you get to hear about the family that owns it and their love",
          "The tour was absolutly beautiful..was so impressed with the tour guide we had..loved the backstory of how the gardens started and the upside down trees..would recommend this trip and did to family who are going in July..",
          "Unfortunately with the early spring snow, many of the flowers had not yet been planted. But still was a very enjoyable tour with the upside down trees, the rivers and ponds, and also massive trees. Wonderful views of the mountains surrounding Juneau from the top of the garden.",
          "This is quite a unique place. The gardens are in a temperate rain forest and show the native flora to good advantage. You travel through the rainforest and the guide explains what you are seeing and explains this unique ecosystem in fair detail. If you thought Alaska was just",
          "Glacier Gardens was a one-of-kind tour. The gardens are an eclectic mix of upside down trees and your garden variety flowers. The landscaping is remarkable and the owner does it all himself. A golf cart takes you up 580 feet into the forest and you get a spectacular view of",
          "Glacier Gardens is an amazing 50-acre Alaskan botanical garden. Visitors take a guided tram tour iinto the heart of the Tongass National Forest. After the tour, explore streams and waterfalls as they bubble through beautiful display gardens.",
          "This whole garden began as an elaborate display of a husband's love for his wife. You will travel up and down a mountain side of beautifully manicured temperate rain forest gardens. The individual displays are unique and artistic. If you like plants and landscaping, you will",
          "I would be remiss if I didn't offer a review of our visit to Glacier Gardens Rainforest Adventures. My wife and I booked a last minute Alaskan Cruise less than two weeks before sailing south in June on the HAL MS Noordam from Seward to Vancouver. Aware that two days before",
          "This was a part of a shore excursion for a cruise I was on. I really enjoyed the experience. Beautiful trees and plants. I was there in October so very late in the season (we were probably the last tour they had). Guides are friendly and knowledgable. The tour stops at a",
          "Something to be seen they have created this amazing upside-down trees planted with so many beautiful coloured flowering plants. Take the bus to the top for the view its wonderful. The history of this garden is fascinating.",
          "This Rainforest gardens that are run by a family is so beautiful and very different to anything that I have seen before, especially the upsize down trees that have flowers growing from the trunks. The garden is huge and to see everything you need to be driven around by golf",
          "We really enjoyed the upside down trees and the magnitude of the grounds. A great achievement, the staff were also lovely.",
          "While more expensive than I really wanted to spend, it was an unusual tour of a very intriguing garden area. The tram ride on the steep and winding road was at times a little disconcerting, and a good experience.",
          "Well worth visiting. Travelled there by public bus, stops out front, short walk up drive to centre. Was raining so hurried around the lovely garden -tree root hanging gardens are fascinating. Inside we enjoyed coffee & cake while admiring the absolutely beautiful interior",
          "This is well worth a visit beautiful plants and trees you go round on little golf carts the veiw at the top is amazing you go up about 600 feet . The trees are upside down and planted out like huge flower baskets . The owners son took us around on a private tour well worth the",
          "Absolutely too beautiful to describe! Easy walk well maintained trails. Also can view the salmon and bear from safe distance during their run season.",
          "The Glacier Gardens and Rainforest were such a surprise. Who knew Alaska had a temperate region? Lush, green, dense forest, and all protected in the Tongass National Forest. The gardens were amazing. I especially liked the fallen trees that were uprooted, stood on end, and",
          "This place is amazing. The reception area is lined with dozens of incredible hanging baskets. The area outside the reception area has a number oi upside down trees planted into the ground with the roots acting as a hanging basket. You are then transported via a golf buggy up",
          "Too bad it was raining. Seemed to be our luck on the cruise to Alaska. You are taken up the mountain road on a tram-like vehicle. 600 feet up the steep road; sometimes very windy road. But once you are at the top the view of the area is magnificent. The family who started",
          "These gardens were really something to behold. After a landslide wiped out most of the trees, the owner inverted the trees into the ground and planted flowers in the base where roots had been. Beside the lower gardens, you are driven up to the top of the property to get a great",
          "This garden is set into the side of a hill, with open vehicles taking you up 500 ft for terrific views of the area and coast. The owner ingeniously inverted trees into he ground so that the former roots serve as the planning base for a variety of plants. Lots of beautiful",

          "After being on cruise with thousands people I wanted some quiet time. I took the city bus for $2 to Glacier Gardens. Taxi guy wanted 25 from cruise terminal. I enjoyed travelling with the locals who were sooo friendly. Upon arrival, a tour bus just finished and when I",
          "The flowers are gorgeous! The tour guides give you a background history of the venue and then take you on a golf cart ride up to the top of the mountain (about 600 feet). Wear warm clothes since the golf cart is open and it's chilly! After viewing downtown from the top, they",
          "This garden is very unique in many ways. Particularity the garden on the inverted dead wood trees. The Bald eagle nest was also a nice experience. to watch. The variety of flowers was very interesting.",
          "This garden is a rare gem. The garden itself is wonderfully full of gorgeous flowers in tree towers and the ride to the top was informative. Tyler was a super guide. The rainforest is exotic and lushly green. A wonderful morning spent at this magical place",
          "It rains all the time in Juneau, it seems, but this is a rain-or-shine garden! A large electric cart takes about 15 guests at a time up the side of the mountain to show off the work of a man who has a passion for flowers. The driver/guide is witty, explaining the grounds.",
          "Another must see while in Juneau. Built on the side of a mountain in a rain forest and it is just beautiful. The tour includes a ride to the top of the mountain with incredible views of the the town and bay.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the gardens! You have to go through on a guided tram tour, but you wouldn't want to walk the steep trails anyway. The view from the top is spectacular - you don't even need to go up the tramway because you can see all of Juneau from here. The creativity",
          "This is a must. The flowers are beautiful and the forest equally interesting and pretty. Our tour guide, which was on a cart, was very informative who explained the rainforest and the flowers. Loved it.",
          "Interesting upside down plants. You take a tram up and around the property and nice view of Juneau from the top. Better than we expected. Nice gift shop, plants and they have a coffee shop too.",
          "So many pretty flowers. You go up over 500 feet from sea level. This place is beautiful. So many different types of flowers cultivated. If you love flowers and nature, this is it. Please consider this as an excursion. Well worth your time. So pretty.",
          "Best activity for those who are less mobile because they provide carts to be transported in. They actually use them for all their tours of the garden. I hesitated going since I already previously visited the Butchart Gardens but glad I went because it is wonderful and unique",
          "You won't find anywhere like this in the world. A very unique visit. We took a friend from out of town- we no longer live in Alaska- and we loved it. Stunning view from up top. Easy for those with limited mobility. Great opportunity to see the Tongass National Forest.",
          "Was absolutely spectacular. The flowers and views were breathtaking. The employees were friendly and informative. Some walking involved. The cart ride up and down the mountain, riders were given a short lecture on the fauna. If you have some time, make this a stop.",
          "This is a beautiful rainforest garden that has upside down trees with flowers growing on them. There is a great lookout point for photos. The golf cart tour into the woods is the only way to go.",
          "The staff is very knowledgeable about the plants and forest. The buggy ride up/down the mountain is GREAT!",

          "Made a stop here as part of an excursion. The flowers were beautiful, my grandma was in heaven, she stayed in the visitor centre had some soup and a coffee and took on all the beautiful flowers. I went up the mountain, the views were beautiful and breathtaking. Watched some",
          "Having a rental car helped getting there, but it is worth a cab ride. $25/adult, less than tramway, beautiful landscape inside rain forest, explanation of fauna, got to see some deer, great view at the top. they even provided umbrellas. Got to taste the various berries.",
          "This was a GEM we stumbled upon. The Glacier Gardens were absolutely beautiful. The staff are so knowledgeable in sharing the history of the area & how the gardens were formed. Highly recommend seeing the beautiful creation & the views when you get to the top of the rain",
          "Our original plan was to take a shuttle to the Gardens which was $55 return including $25 admission to the Garden. We got off the ship before 10 and the first shuttle was at 11:30. We knew there was local bus service so we went to the Info center to get details. The bus was",
          "There is a lot going on here, but the main claim is the upside down trees and it feels like you pay a lot of money to seem them. Just remember I'm not a gardening person so completely lost on me",

          "We expected a lot more for the $25 we paid per ticket to visit the Glacier Gardens Rainforest Adventure. What we got was a golf cart ride up and down the hill through the same forest you see while hiking. There wasn't much of a garden to see. This is unfortunately a tourist",
          "We visited the garden on a rainy day (like most of the days in Juneau). The work that was done there is very interesting and the garden is nice. Also the tour of the mountain (with a golf cart) was interesting and the view from the hill on the airport and the river is very nice.",
          "Wasn't worth the money especially if you take cab. Otherwise nice views and nice knowledgable guides. If you have other opportunities to see the forest than pass on this. I can see people who have difficulty walking finding this to be a great view of the Alaska Forrest because",

          "This exursion was part of a packaged deal with Mendenhall Glacier and the Salmon Hatchery in Juneau. You definitely get your money's worth out of this exursion. Make sure you don't plan any other excursions on the day you plan this one because it takes up like 75% of your day.",

          "The Glacier Gardens are beautiful! I was truly amazed at the unexpected lushness of the flowers and forest. I guess with so many hours of daylight, the flowers really take advantage of the summer. I've never seen upside down trees - they're used as planters and are gorgeous.",
          "The flowers are pretty and I guess if you aren't a hiker, the golf cart tour through the woods is pretty. We took the local bus to get there. For me, it wasn't one of the best things I did in Juneau but I would guess that many people like it. it would be much better if there",
          "If you like flowers/gardens...this if for you. Tram ride through forest with narrative by driver. The ride itself is pretty exciting. A learning experience along with beautiful scenery. Worth a visit.",

          "This was my favorite part of our cruise to Alaska. There was a little bit of fog and it made the rainforest look like a scene from a movie. The guy who did the overview of the garden when we first arrived was a little over the top. Sounded like a drill Sargent telling you how",

Situated on 46 acres, the site contains a stone chapel, crypt, labyrinth, columbarium, lodge, cabin, and retreat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1925, St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux was named the patroness of Alaska. In the 1930s, the Jesuit priest, Father William LeVasseur came up with the idea of a retreat center in her name. Bishop Joseph Raphael John Crimont provided support for its establishment, buying federal land. Thousands of stones were used to construct the chapel and other structures, which were gathered by volunteers. The first mass was held in 1941. In 1945, Bishop Crimont died and was buried at the shrine's crypt.In 1953, Bishop Robert Dermot O'Flanagan started The League of the Little Flower to help make the shrine self-sufficient. The shrine fell into disrepair and stopped holding retreats in the 1960s but underwent renovation under the leadership of Fr. James Manske from 1968\u201369. For financial reasons, the shrine was forced to close in 1985 but reopened the following year after 25 locals came together to save the shrine.In 1998, the columbarium was built and is open to all Christians who want their cremains placed at the shrine. In 2000, a new cabin was built to commemorate the Great Jubilee, and in 2001, the Merciful Love Labyrinth was built.On October 1, 2016, Bishop Edward J. Burns announced that the Shrine of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se had been raised to the status of national shrine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shrine of St. Therese, Juneau at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

I didn\u2019t want to leave the Shrine of Saint Therese. By far this is my very favorite excursion of all the ports we\u2019ve",

          "If you see one thing in Juneau! See this place amazing view of the bay. Extremely special, short hike for all ages!",
          "hidden gem. we thought it would be just a church but it is so much more. the church is set on a tiny island reached by a footbridge , hidden behind the trees with all sorts of statues around it. it faces out onto the ocean with scenic views of the islands and a whale if lucky.",
          "Take a beautiful drive to the shrine, you will pass several rivers and glaciers along the way. Once you arrive you can walk through this tranquil setting, take your time and pause to enjoy the relaxing and spiritual setting. A must see when you are in Juneau.",
          "What a beautiful spot, not far from Juneau. It was amazing there was snow all along the shoreline until you walked out to this lovely shrine. A must see if you go to Juneau.",
          "We arrived about 9pm and that didn't give us much time to explore. They were open til 10pm. We just basically walked out to the church that appears to be on an island. It was still open and quite quiet inside. We wandered around the church for a few minutes then headed back to",
          "Nestled by the bay about 20 miles north of Juneau, this is an awesome place just to meditate, pray, and soak in the scenery. While the Church Shrine is relatively austere, the church itself is located on a rocky outcrop overlooking the bay. Surrounded by trees, there is an",
          "I found this through a things to do while in Juneau Google search. The drive out to the Shrine was beautiful and the Shrine itself was so peaceful. My husband and I walked the grounds. We took pictures of the Shrine and of the surrounding Stations of the Cross. We took the",
          "We didn't really know what to expect and just stopped in because we were driving down the coast road and saw a sign for the shrine. It was definitely worth a stop! You drive down into a parking lot and then walk a short trail to the shrine itself. It is surrounded by forest but",
          "Loved this hidden attraction. Very interesting landscape and church with unexpected gardens and other items around. Would recommend as a stop while in Juneau.",
          "This shrine sits on some of the most scenic landscape in Juneau. You can walk around the grounds which are full of trees, flowers and the ocean very close by. Some people were combing the beaches for star fish etc. others were admiring the plants and fruit trees and how",
          "Gorgeous location, with pretty gardens (complete with a cat who will come by to cuddle if you stay long enough), a columbarium, a labyrinth, walking trail with stations of the cross, a beach, and a picturesque chapel on a peninsula, connected to the main Shrine by a small",

          "We found the Shrine of St Therese on a drive out toward Auke Bay. The site is a retreat site and has a waking labyrinth, stations of the Cross, and a beautiful Chapel. The site is on the water which adds to the serenity to the site. Very Peaceful Walk on the grounds.",
          "We went here by accident as I had not really realized what it was. It is a beautiful little church on a small island with the stations of the cross and a garden. It is Catholic, so I would recommend it for anyone interested in Catholic churches.",
          "If you enjoy visiting beautiful religious shrines in scenic locations, this is one you'll want to see when you are in the Juneau area. You can drive into their parking lot and walk the causeway to the shrine on what was probably an island before. Or, if you are disabled, you can",
          "Beautiful spot, very peaceful, quiet. Well worth the stop. Would like to have spent more time. Great place to wonder around and take some nice pictures. The church is quite something. Not touristy at all.",
          "It could have been a great stay but the sewer made it less attractive because of the smell. Warning not to go into the sea because of this, came to my attention on the way back. Beds not to good, positions even stranger.",

          "An absolute must while in Juneau ! We were glad that we drove up here to this beautiful and charming shrine in a wonderful setting indeed. I think one would miss something by not visiting this out of the world Shrine.",
          "If you are in Juneau you shall visit this shrine, it is far form the city, you will need a car, but it is worthy the visit. The place is beautiful, relaxing and inspiring. Views are excellent as well as the small chapel. Do not miss it.",
          "Be sure to go to the arboretum next door (beautiful spot). This whole area is just one of the most beautiful spots on earth. You have to take a cab or tour out there. About a 30 minute drive.",

          "Well kept grounds with picturesque small shrine/chapel located on a small isthmus off the main property. Beautiful setting and apparent retreat location for Catholics.",
          "North of the Juneau airport there is a place that should not be overlooked. The Shrine of St. Theresa will only take about an hour out of your day. I was the only person there until I was leaving. The church construction is fitting for the surroundings. It is built on a island",
          "A unique church, it is built out of the stone and cedar from the environment that surrounds it. The tree roots form staircases around the Shrine, and you almost forgot that you are surrounded on all sides by the Pacific ocean. You cannot help but feel serene and thoughtful",
          "This was a beautiful spot on the water, fairly well maintained. We saw some ravens, and walked the ground a little bit. I can see why this would be used as a retreat house.",
          "Came here while our ship was docked! Really peaceful and very pretty! Lovely look around and was very surreal! The place is well looked after and views from the lake are to die for! Highly recommend :)",
          "Our cousin took us here when we were visiting her in Juneau. You walk out on a small trail to a wooded island. The shrine is in the middle of a lovely grove of trees, surrounded by water and a spectacular view. It is worth going out here to see the site and feels very private.",

          "This is a very peaceful and serene place to visit. The views are spectacular as well. There is a lot of area to walk around if you choose to but isn't necessary. Very calming place.",
          "This was an unexpected surprise visit which was so beautiful. I would highly recommend spending some time walking around there.",
          "We rented a car in Juneau and drove out to the Shrine of St. Therese. It was a very scenic and peaceful place.",
          "This is really a retreat center with several paths, gardens, cabins, and the like strewn out over the waterfront about 30 minutes from town. The little jewel of a stone chapel is located down a fern-lined path just across from the mainland. It is very quiet and soul-satisfying",
          "This was one of the things to do on my wife's to do list in Juneau and it was totally worth the drive. We decided to rent a car on a beautiful sunny Juneau day to enjoy the sites and we must say it was worth the drive, its extremely beautiful and the history behind it is great!",
          "Don't miss this beautiful setting, the stone chapel is beautiful. Wonderful natural scenery. I could go out here every day.",
          "There was a neat little walking path leading to an observation area where we could see sea lions and whales across the bay.",
          "Beautiful place which is an easy stop off the road. However, if you have done any other hiking in Juneau along the shore this isn't anything new. Good stop if you haven't done any other hiking, but otherwise not a must do.",
          "We visited Juneau on a cruise ship stop. Rented a car specifically because we wanted enough time to visit this shrine. Juneau was our shortest port day, and we would have loved to have had more time to spend at the Shrine of St Therese. We had stopped at the salmon hatchery and",
          "Hadn't really heard of this before but was part of a tour package. Beautiful wooded sanctuary..peaceful calm and gorgeous views.",
          "So you have to be respectful and not make much noise this is one of the rules here. Your allowed to visit and look around. This is such a beautiful place and so are all the landmarks. Really worth the long ride up",
          "Lovely place to take a short stroll and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the shoreline, bay and mountains. The shrine is a beautiful structure and the setting is spectacular.",
          "Arrived. Walked down the path. Walked over to the island via the path. Visited the chapel and a few of the stations. Part of our tour with Patrick and Eric from the Adventure Flow Tour Company of Juneau.",
          "a local suggested going there, its about 13 miles past the glacier but is a great spot for photos and if your a religious person, the 12 points of the cross are pretty cool as there up the hill near the church in a cool spot",
          "Beautiful place about a 30 minute drive north of Juneau. A Catholic retreat for the diocese, but visitors are welcome to walk the grounds. The church is on a very natural island accessible by a causeway. short religious themed trails like labyrinths and stations of the cross.",
          "This is a beautiful shrine on the waters edge in juneau. So peaceful beautiful stone structures and gardens.",
          "Make the drive out to this property. It has spectacular views. Relax and recharge as you take in the natural beauty that surrounds you. The chapel is beautiful and simple. Easy walking around the property. Bald Eagles and Ravens welcome you as you walk under the trees.",
          "It's a small shrine on a tiny island by the water. It's really a unique place to visit if you want to stay away from the cruise ship crowds. You do need a car to get there.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and tranquility here. The Shrine is very nice and makes for outstanding photos. The grounds and gardens are just lovely with many beautiful flowers and water all around you. Great for a short stop to stretch your legs!!",
          "Beautiful and peaceful, off the beaten path. Our private tour took us here, and there were no tour buses.",
          "It's been on my list of places to go in Juneau. Was not disappointed. The place was very serene and peaceful. I think they hold retreats in the cabins nearby. It's a beautiful place. We had rented a car for the day so we were able drive to the shrine.",
          "This is a nice play to add to your visit if staying in Juneau for longer than a few days. Nice to say you have been here.",
          "A beautiful, serene, and tranquil setting. Can walk around the area in an hour to 90 min. Has a small gift shop, but we didn't go in so I can't comment on the contents. Beautiful chapel on the grounds. Several trails though the woods including several monuments to the victims of",

          "This is a must-go place in Juneau, a pocket of peace and solitude. When we visited, a retreat was happening in teh retreat house and we strolled the grounds, said a prayer in the beautiful chapel and breathed the fresh Alaska air. I understand at times one can see whales",
          "The place is very peaceful, you really feel a connection with the nature and yourself, you have a great view.",
          "This is not a touristy place but mostly a place of solitude for locals and visitors. It's absolutely beautiful and quiet. Glad there are no big buses with noisy tourists. The church is hidden inside a small peninsula and is not discoverable from the road. It's always open. You",
          "We only spent about half an hour but that was plenty to walk the grounds and visit the church. The stations of the cross are beautiful.",
          "The shrine church is on a little peninsula with great views of the water. It looks like the church is sitting in a magical, enchanted forest. The walkways are all through gnarled roots of giant trees. So much history. It is awe inspiring. Don't miss this little gem!",
          "This is a bit out of town- you need a car to get here, but it's great paired with a trip to Eagle Beach for a picnic. If you are Catholic, a VERY worthwhile trip. It's a beautiful stone shrine to St Therese and has Stations of the Cross on the property around the shrine. You",
          "We only visited the shrine briefly, taking the time to walk around the grounds and visit the church. It's a wonderful place for some downtime, reflective moment.",

          "I'm not much of a religious person, but even I felt awed and inspired by the beauty of St. Therese. Covered with beautiful trees and deep silences, it is a wonderful place to contemplate and worship. Plan for several hours here as there are plenty of paths to explore. Make sure",
          "This site was recommended by a local and I am so thrilled that they did. Located about 22 miles north of Juneau downtown, you must have a car or take a taxi out there. But, well worth the travels. Simply amazing views, beautiful gardens, a scenic chapel out on Shrine",
          "Like a lot of places in juneau, or most of alaska for that matter, the shrine is located on a very peaceful, calm, beautiful landscape, with the holiness factor added to it, makes for sone quiet time to meditate and refocus. Very welcoming, parking available, restrooms, and a",
          "The views and location were so beautiful it was well worth the short drive, at least on the sunny day that we were lucky to experience. There is a retreat as well as a shrine at the site, situated on the water with views of the mountains. It was a peaceful setting to sit and",
          "We drove out here on a calm and warm June afternoon and found much more than we expected. Not only is their a shrine, but their is also an entire retreat complex, manicured grounds, prayer stations, and a stone church. All but the retreat buildings are located on a small and",
          "We picked this spot because I wanted to get out of town and see the Juneau countryside, and coming to this secluded shrine was a delightful surprise for all of us. It was like a fairyland with its heavy moss-covered trees around the chapel. The various biblical scenes were",

          "A hidden gem, beautiful gardens, stone church hidden in the trees next to the water. Kids loved the walks and playing on the rocks, could see some water life playing too. Seals and maybe a whale.",
          "This small country church can be accessed by car. Handicapped accessible but up a slope. The quiet area gives a special charm and sense of peace.",
          "I had a few hours while in town for work so I went to see this shrine that happens to be dedicated to the same saint as my home parish. It is absolutely beautiful. I spent over two hours exploring and meditating. The chapel is out on an island connected by a land bridge. It is",
          "Beautiful, quiet grounds to visit while in Juneau. Out on the little \"island\" is the chapel and stations of the cross. The landscape here along the coast is worth stopping to visit.",

          "Despite the rain, we had a nice visit to the shrine. The chapel and grounds are beautiful and tranquil.",

          "This place would be a great place for a retreat. The grounds are amazing and I took piles of pictures of flowers. I was not able to walk a lot and there are more trails etc. leading to more to see but even just sitting by the water was renewing.",
          "I live 15 miles away from the Shrine and it is one of my favorite spots in Juneau. I always take adult visitors here. (Older children might enjoy it, but younger kids, probably not so much. There are also steep cliffs and rocky coast, and no play areas.) The chapel is on an",
          "Worth a brief stop if you are on the 7 highway, but not worth a special trip in my mind. Catholic parishoners may feel differently and I could understand.",
          "The Shrine is an excellent place to visit. The architecture and location are breathtaking and it provides a wonderful spot for prayer and introspection. Highly recommend",
          "If you have a rental car, this is a must see stop. It's far out of downtown Juneau (about 26 miles north), but well worth a visit. A very scenic and quiet chapel sits within a wooded area on the coastline. You do have to take a short hike from the parking area, but it's",
          "Peaceful area to enjoy the day away from the crowd. Pack a picnic and eat there or a few miles ahead at Eagle Beach.",

          "Short walk and a beautiful view. The parking lot is just off of the highway and the trail is a short one, but worth it for the view and peaceful serenity. The chapel is quite beautiful and a feat of construction for its location! Stations of the cross are scattered around the",
          "There are ample grounds to walk around and watch for passing whales. Among other things there is a maze to stroll around and meditate...and of course the Church. There are accommodations but one has to call ahead and reserve.",

          "This was my favorite place to visit during our trip. Stopped here on the first day and spent way more time than I expected. It is absolutely beautiful and so amazing the amount of work that people did here. It was so peaceful, lots of benches to just sit and watch the many birds",
          "It was a nice scenic 30 minute drive to St Therese from Juneau. There is a chapel along side the bay hidden amidst the tall trees. It's a beautiful place to visit and be one with nature. Beautiful views of the bay and mountains and bird watching also.",

          "This is a place that exudes a very spiritual commitment to a coastal development. There is a very comfortable air amidst numerous religious displays and a quaint chapel hidden on an island copse. While it will take some time to make the drive from downtown, it is well worth a",
          "I live in Juneau and one of the first places I visited was the Shrine of St. Therese. I loved it. It was a dreary day with drizzling rain so not much to see around with the clouds hanging so low. I walked around the church following a little path. There were hardly any",
          "I love this place. The grounds are gorgeous and the church is beautiful. From the parking lot it is about 1/3 mile walk out to the church itself. The church is a quaint stone building with a wood interior. This location is also excellent to watch the sun set over the mountains.",

          "Just driving out to the north end of the road is an Alaskan treat. Often weather is a bit better as you go north of town. Anyway hopefully you stopped at Lena Loop picnic area for a potty break and view of the cove. Then off to the Shrine. You don't have to be Catholic to",

Its main building is now operated as the Last Chance Mining Museum by the Gastineau Historical Society.  The camp was located on the southern banks of Gold Creek, about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Juneau, near what is now the end of Basin Road.  The camp was the site of one of the largest gold finds in the Juneau mining district.  It was established between 1910 and 1913 by the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company and operated until 1944, producing more than $80 million worth of gold.  The largest surviving structure of the camp is its air compressor building, which was 84 feet (26 m) long, and still houses the compressor used by the company.  Also surviving are a variety of railroad-related resources, which the company used to bring or to its mill on the Gastineau channel, an electrical transformer house, powder magazine, and cable hoist.The camp, with a total of 21 contributing buildings and structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Last Chance Basin Historic District at Wikimedia Commons\n\nLast Chance Mining Museum - Gastineau Historical Society",

          "I had some time to kill but did not want to spend a lot of money, to I took a taxi to the mine and arranged for him to pick me up in 90 minutes. The mine exhibit was interesting, but I learned more from talking to the volunteer about the mining process. I did buy an",
          "We had some extra time so we stopped in. Very interesting, especially if you like old tools & machines. We tried our hand at panning for gold but no real luck.",
          "Love the road that leads here.. it is an adventure in itself. Very peaceful out at the locale. one can walk if full of energy. Panning for gold was a treat and adventure. A lot of old mining pieces on display help to tell the story of mining in JUneau",
          "Had some time to kill before our flight left later on in the afternoon so decided this was the way to go. Hiked a little way up to the museum only to find it closed so there went that. Sat on the swing for a few minutes while contemplating our next move. Wasn't much else to",
          "The old processing building still has equipment used in the mine. A volunteer told us about the mine's history and how the ore was processed. Getting to the museum may be a problem for those with impaired mobility. You either walk or bike from downtown Juneau (allow at least an",
          "Fascinating display of mining equipment, but the drive out to the mine is a gold-mine in itself. You pass mountains with waterfalls and drive on a narrow road - it is not far from town, but it seems like you are worlds away. Definitely a 5-star experience!",
          "We visited the Last Chance Mining Museum on our last two visits to Juneau because of the beautiful setting and the extensive amount of artifacts. The caretaker was a wonderful source of information, as was the volunteer. Being greeted by Galena was an extra special treat! Be",
          "Not much history to see in my opinion. It is very steep for seniors to get to museum and pricey for what they offer to see.",
          "We walked here on a drizzly day and arrived, by luck, just in time for them to reopen (they close in the middle of the day). The volunteer was extremely nice to the children (ages 7 and 8) and they were fascinated. The museum itself is very picturesque. The walk there is through",
          "There is very little to see in the museum other than tools to sharpen a knife, a drill press, or a drill bit sharpener. It's a mile hike out of town and our feelings along with everyone else we met along the way was that the trip was a waste of valuable time in Juneau. You will",
          "The Last Chance Mining Museum is more than that - the museum is great, with lots of well-placed artifacts and a very knowledgeable staff. Check times if interested in the museum - it may be closed during the lunch hour. That said, you can take a nice walk from the parking lot",
          "See a gold panning demo and then get down and dirty along the creek and try it yourself the way they did it during the Alaska goldrush. You use real tin pans and keep what you find - usually a few flakes of a gold substance (well, they SAID it was real)! There is walking",
          "I wasn't planning on visiting this museum. My family and I just came across it while on a hike from Juneau. A group of others was visiting as part of an excursion. They were accompanied by a guide in mining attire once they exited the tour bus and were gathered together for a",
          "This place is not the easiest to reach and not for wheel chairs as you have a long walk from the parking lot both up and down a trail before reaching the museum. I had assumed there was tour of the abandoned mine as in places I visited but there was no tour here. A large room",
          "Follow the narrow street/road to the top of Juneau. Start of perseverance trail.. Great small mine tour at the old compressor building, lots of carefully collected equipment, pictures and a fabulous keeper who will answer questions and is passionate about preserving this.",
          "We visited the museum just before closing, so it was just a 30-minute swing through, but we enjoyed the relics of Juneau's gold rush days. As a history buff, I found the museum a real gem, set in a beautiful valley, just off of a creek.",
          "My dad, an old placer miner in interior Alaska, enjoyed this collection very much; he knew what most of the equipment and tools were used for and was a very enthusiastic guide for me the novice miner. A guide or more interpretive info would be helpful",
          "We took a taxi (9$) to get to the parking lot. Then you have a small bridge to cross and a short hike up to the museum.(5 min.) You could walk all the way up from town (first streets, then dirt roads, about 35-40 minutes, we figured the taxi would save us time and effort,",
          "We decided to walk knowing it was a steep walk up, but we needed the exercise! We were the only ones there, and the tour guide gave us so much interesting information! It's small, but the love the couple has put into sharing the history of their area makes it special.",
          "If you are at all interested in mining history, you'll like this museum. After parking, you have a walk up hill and stairs to the actual building, which houses typical mining equipment and tells the story of this particular mine. If you are so inclined, you can walk further up",
          "Good historical info on mining. Docent friendly. Is a long walk to get there if you're not in good health. Nice walk over a bridge, then uphill to museum. Has benches along way to rest if you get tired.",

          "It was a nice little hike up to the museum area, but was disappointed with it. I'm really into old gold mining, but not thrilled here. It had an old huge air compressor and bunch of tools in the original shop. Would have liked to see more of the mine and maybe a guided tour of",

          "We walked from town all the way up the mountain! I would not encourage you to do so unless you are in great shape. It was a very steep walk up through town .but once you get to the top of town. The path evens out. It took us about 50 minutes (I think)But absolutely gorgeous",
          "We took in this museum because we were hiking the Preseverance Trail. It's small museum with nice artifacts. I've seen much better mining museums in Colorado and Reno. Not worth a special trip to see.",
          "The walk to the museum is worth the time. The museum had signs for reading but very little activity for younger children. if you can arrange to pan for gold, then it might be worth the trip. I enjoyed walking the grounds Be aware the trail is steep to the museum and there is no",
          "Getting there is a nice walk. Take an umbrella or rain jacket just in case the weather isn't being cooperative. We enjoyed this museum, as it is an original building to the mine. Numerous pieces of equipment for the mining operation and the miners are displayed. Reportedly the",
          "We stopped up to see the mine and were impressed with all the equipment, photos and rocks. It is a pretty hike to get there. Up a trail over a bridge and up a hill. The owner is very helpful and easy to talk with about mining. If you are interested in mining, this is a must",
          "This museum is in the last remaining building of an old mine. I believe it was also the largest of the buildings of the mine. PLEASE BE WARNED... the museum keeps strange hours. I think the hours during our visit were 9:30am-12:30pm and 3:00pm-6:30pm. We didn't know that",
          "Rivers, mountains and waterfalls around the Last Chance Mining Museum were stunning in the rain and mist! Would've liked to have hiked back there but ran out of time. Museum is not very big, but has a lot of interesting artifacts and a cute cat named Julie. Short drove behind",
          "Hiked up the hill towards the lit Neon sign saying\"OPEN\", strange hours, 3.30 PM to 6.00 PM. We arrived at 4PM and the place was locked up. VERY unprofessional, VERY disappointing. A waste of valuable time.",
          "I called before I hiked up to this museum. An answering machine for Renee and Gary listed the hours as 9:30 to 12:30. I arrived at a locked gate at 10:10 and called the answering machine again. After waiting about 30 minutes I decided to write this review. All Gary and Renee",
          "We drove all the way up the dirt road to the end to visit the museum only to find out that they are only open a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the afternoon. Needless to say we didn't know that the hours were split like this so we were unable to go in since they",

          "The drive up to the old mine is worth it for its own sake. Juneau is built up the side of a mountain; part of the road is a wooden bridge around a curve of the mountain. The valley and stream were lovely; I wish that I'd had the time to take the hike further up the valley",
          "A short walk off the beaten track lands you in the time of Gold Mining in Alaska. Renee the hat lady will probably be your host and is very knowledgeable.",
          "This place was hard to find and had a steep incline to get to it. But, it was interesting and the owner was very personable.",
          "If you like history, this is a neat place. The mining exhibits and artifacts tell a story about Juneau you won't find at the jewelry stores and tourist shops next to the cruise docks. It will make you realize just how difficult the gold seekers challenge was. Don't miss it.",
          "This was a very cool piece of history. The museum had a very nice man answering questions and taking the time to tell us stories and his experiences over the years. Amazing to think the people did all that so many decades ago!",
          "We learned more from the woman who worked there than anything else! Not many people go here. My family was the only one there at the time and my husband and son got a one on one history lesson for about half an hour and loved it. The museum is one big room. Not everything is",
          "The walk is to the mine was lovely. The people were very knowledgeable and gave us a nice talk. I felt the displays need to be better labeled. I had no idea what some of the things were. Would have like to have seen more displays of the mining industry in the 30's. Perhaps",
          "We always take or send visitors here. Last time I was up it was staffed by volunteers, so check hours. It's just around a corner from downtown Juneau but instntly puts you in another world. It offers many historical items and exhibits.",

          "Yes, the musuem needs help. The dust and lack of polish adds the the charm of an old good mine. Check the hours before going as we had to wait for an hour midday. My grandson brought a pan and some of the locals showed him how to pan. The best reward possible-- He actually found",

          "The museum was up a slightly steep hill, but accesable. It was a collection of old mining equipment and some photos, but not as much information about the item, or history of the museum as I would have liked. We did a little \"gold panning\" in the creek too.",
          "We visited this site on a Saturday on a very rainy day. The staff was local and knew lots of history of Juneau and the mining. Lots of stuff to read, look at it, and touch. Really enjoyed the time we spent strolling the Museum and the grounds surrounding the museum. Also, we",

        "wiki": "The Eagle River is a stream, 5 miles (8 km) long, in the borough of Juneau in the U.S. state of Alaska. Heading at Eagle Glacier in the Coast Mountains, it flows southwest into Favorite Channel, 20 miles (32 km) northeast of the city of Juneau. Alaska Route 7 (Glacier Highway) links the city to the river, a state recreation area, a church camp, and a boy scout camp near the river mouth.\nHiking trails parallel the river for its entire course. One, the Amalga Trail, leads to a public-use cabin on a lake near the foot of Eagle Glacier in the Tongass National Forest. Remnants of the forming mining town of Amalga and the Eagle Creek Mine are slightly north of the river along an unnamed tributary.\n\n\n== Course ==\nBeginning at Eagle Glacier in the Coast Mountains of Southeast Alaska, Eagle River flows generally southwest for about 5 miles (8 km) through parts of the Tongass National Forest. Its headwaters include a small unnamed lake, along the right bank of which runs a hiking trail, the Amalga Trail. Also on the right near the downstream end of the lake is Eagle Glacier Cabin, a public-use structure managed by the United States Forest Service.On the upper and middle reaches of the river, small unnamed tributaries enter from the left and right. One of them, entering from the right downstream of Eagle Glacier Cabin, drains the Amalga Site, remnants of the Eagle River Mine and the former mining town of Amalga.Along its lower reaches, the river borders Eagle Beach State Recreation Area, which is on the right.  The Amalga Trail, which here is part of the recreation area, is also on the right. Also to the right, surrounded by recreation area land, is a United Methodist Church camp. Loop Trail runs around the camp, intersecting Amalga Trail along the river. Slightly downstream of the trail junction, the river passes under Alaska Route 7 (Glacier Highway) and receives the Herbert River from the left.Beyond the confluence with the Herbert, Eagle River flows by tidal flats on the left and right. Here, Loop Trail runs along the right bank until it meets Beach Access Trail, which leads to a beach picnic area. Boy Scout Beach Trail, associated with the scout camp, across the river from the church camp, follows the left bank. Saturday Creek, which flows through Methodist Camp, enters from the right, before Eagle River empties into Favorite Channel.Eagle Beach is 2 miles (3 km) north of Dotsons Landing and about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Juneau. The river mouth is opposite Shelter and Lincoln islands, which separate Favorite Channel from Saginaw Channel, to the west. The Alaska Marine Highway runs along Favorite Channel between the islands and Eagle Beach.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers of Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEagle Beach/Scout Camp Project \u2013 Southeast Alaska Land Trust\nEagle River United Methodist Camp\nHistory of the Juneau Gold Belt \u2013 Bureau of Land Management",

          "We drove to this beautiful beach while staying in Juneau. We timed to be there a little before sunset. Enjoyed walking along the beach and it is great place for picnic. We saw lots of eagles and that was great but the sunset was amazing.",
          "We were the only people here and there were no eagles. It was pouring rain. I wonder if it would have been better on a sunny day?",
          "Awesome scenery but no eagles. Beautiful drive from Juneau. Rented car in Juneau and drove out of town for an hour.",
          "We drove from the pier (about 30 minutes) on a self -guided tour. Once you arrive, you park near some picnic tables and walk out about 100-150 yards. Turn around, and you can see the Eagle glacier which we were told is not visible from anywhere else unless you take a helicopter",
          "We rented a car in Juneau so we could go to Eagle Beach at low tide to see the 100s of eagles I'd read about. We saw only two. In speaking with a park ranger we learned that it's been a few years since large numbers of eagles were seen here. There seem to be fewer salmon in the",
          "We stopped at Eagle Beach on our Jeep tour! The beach area is very large with picnic tables. The views are beautiful and it was very quiet and peaceful on a Monday!",
          "You won't fing any more eagles there than anywhere else and it's a drive to get there but a nice drive",
          "The eagles are plentiful here in spawning season for the salmon. They sit around and wait for their next meal. Only competition are the bears and there are plenty of salmon to share. Great place to see dozens of eagles",
          "Nice area for a visit with nature. Located north of Juneau along the Glacier Highway (7) where the Eagle River into Favorite Channel, the recreation area provides views of Lynn Canal, the Chilkat Mountains, and the Juneau Mountains. There are picnic tables and pavilions, and",
          "Grand views. There were picnic tables and a bathroom. It was a nice spot to take a break. We had a rental car and the drive to this spot was wonderful. It gets even better past it.",
          "You can enjoy a nice walk along a long beach at low tide and the views of the mountains across the channel are wonderful.",
          "Beautiful spot! I would highly suggest putting this on your itinerary.....just don\u2019t go on a bus full of tourists. We rented a car in Juneau and visited this beach on a day of exploring. It\u2019s not far from the Shrine of Saint Therese where supreme peacefulness can be found, too.",
          "If you are a hiker, photographer, or someone who just loves to commune with nature you must go here! Be very careful if you're here during Spring through October as the bears love this place as well. Hiking, picture taking or just walking around on the many level trails make",
          "Visited this beach in August. Amazing place for eagle watching. I\u2019m not sure I would walk the trails again, within an hour I saw one bear within 20 feet that vanished quickly, turned around and than ran into a bear a few feet away. First time in my life a bear made me fear for",
          "Eagle Beach is more Eagle than Beach... at least that's our experience. We took a self-guided tour to the beach, and found very little beach... but plenty of eagles. Eagle Beach is mostly gravel - along a route to the sea. And eagles seem to favor this area. We arrived mid-day",
          "Amazing views, perfect for picnic and may be camping. Every place in Alaska is amazing :). There are some hiking trails in the area as well",
          "Just a really nice beach, and easy walk from the road, with great view back towards the icefield. These reviews are supposed to be 100 characters so this is a bonus sentence.",
          "This is a beautiful area and worth a stop especially if on a cruise and try to get away from the thousands of fellow passengers dumped on the city. We didn't see any eagles here, but some in our party had a too close for comfort encounter with a bear. Overall a good stop and",
          "Bald eagles everywhere! A very, very scenic area. We rented a car and drove out to this beach - scenic drive. Lots of bear tracks etc., salmon, ravens and eagles.",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip. We were ALONE on the south part of the beach, with just one other family way on the other end. Watched eagles perched on logs in the water, flying around, and two huge juvenile bald eagles in a tree. Hands down, this was better than",
          "Was able to see plenty of eagles in the distance, across the river. Many flying high in the sky, while others were nested in the trees!",
          "We hiked the paths for a few hours - mostly shaded, mostly flat. The beach is expansive. And we saw so. many. eagles. Up close, flying right by us, in the water - everywhere.",
          "The birds like the low tide and the flats for picking at fish - not necessarily swooping down to catch them! Soooo many eagles in one place. At high tide - only two!",
          "We were able to get close enough to eagles to fill the frame. These are the best eagle photos I gotten in my 3 previous trips to Alaska!",
          "So many eagles! Also a salmon stream- we saw several jumping! beautiful setting- went at low tide so we could get right down by the water.",
          "Never seen so many bald headed eagles in one place. Worth staying a while to see them flying and feeding. Bear sightings are possible en route",
          "I drove my rental car up this way with hopes of photographing bald eagles. I could hear their calls in the distant trees, but they would wait until I was talking to someone and then fly overhead. This is a large area and the Eagle River had quite a flow to it with salmon",
          "Worth a visit if you have a car and love seeing eagles. Eagles sitting on the beach, on rocks, any branch, flying by at eye level. Neat experience for us from other areas.",
          "Eagle beach is at the other end of Juneau compared to where I am. It's so worth the drive! It's so pretty and you can walk along the beach or on a trail.",
          "Sightseeing in Juneau and provisioning our charter boat for a cruise to Ketchikan could not have been easier thanks to Juneau Car Rental Company. The staff, including Marisa, Mikayla, and Ainsley, were super friendly and helpful. Four of us, plus luggage, had a black Lincoln",
          "Visited Eagle beach with my wife and teen daughters on June 10th. Beautiful estuary - Eagle creek provides nutrients making this a fertile place for fish and wildlife. We saw 2 humpback whales feeding off the coast, and lots of birds, including an eagle that flew right over",
          "Eagle beach is a beautiful place and has plenty of space to picnic or wade in the water. But, if you're going here solely to see eagles, I wouldn't bother. I can only go according to our two visits which were not at the optimal time of year (May), but we saw more eagles right",
          "Visiting in the very beginning of August, we arrived at what appeared to be the tail end of the most recent salmon run as there were only a few stragglers still trying to make their way upstream among the dead and dying salmon so we only saw a few juvenile bald eagles that",
          "This place is pretty far down the road from most of the sights you'll see in Juneau, but it is beautiful and worth the visit if you have time.",
          "Because Eagle Beach (State Recreation area) has such a gently-sloping beach due to glacial runoff, tides dramatically change. If you're looking for a longer walk, find out when low tide is and go a little early--and remember to keep tabs on when the tide starts coming in: do",
          "Great museum with many birds and amazing ambient good Info about the local fauna nice for children and family",
          "I love this hike, to connect with nature and get exercise also! The beauty is spectacular. I would recommend this place to anyone. At low tide, you can hike out for a long distance.",
          "Love this place! Great area to walk, but be mindful of the tides or you may end up staying out longer than intended.",
          "Bald eagles aren't really a for sure thing unless the salmon are running so if that's why you're coming out here then time your visit accordingly. Then again, bald eagles are pretty common in Juneau so you'll probably see one or two at some point around town even if they aren't",
          "Came here our last day in Juneau. Very beautiful, lots of bald eagles and other birds. A lot of bear tracks although we didn't see the bears. It was the end of salmon season, so there were dead salmon everywhere, smelled bad in places, but that is to be expected.",
          "Rented a car to get us out of the city. Eagle Beach was a pleasant stop, saw several immature bald eagle along with other waterfowl, plenty of seagulls and a plethora of dead and dying salmon. We were there we the tide began to turn and it comes in quickly. I can see getting",
          "The place is famous to watch the rare bird Bald Eagle. we saw 4 bald Eagles their. It was a feast to watch this bird and take pictures.",
          "Was raining pretty good the whole time we were there. Did not get to see any eagles (though we have seen there here before), but the rivers were teaming with salmon and we did see bears. Nice trails, beautiful park.",
          "What a great spot ... eagles, geese and all sorts of other e=sea birds. What a sight watching eagles sour.",
          "We visited Eagle Beach in late July at low tide during the salmon run and saw numerous eagles. We hiked out onto the beach which was picturesque, and there were eagles everywhere. Also sitting in the trees near the parking lot. Highly recommended during this time of year at",
          "Came here on a Thursday afternoon. Saw a bear eating salmon in the river, that was quite exciting. Long path to walk on and great views.",
          "We had rented a car and drove up the coast a bit to see if we could get a glimpse of the eagles. Unfortunately, the day we went, there were not many eagles out, although we did see some eagle tracks.",
          "Eagle beach is a quiet getaway to relax and enjoy a nice walk and wildlife sighting. We want on a Sunny Saturday and many locals were enjoying picnics and barbecue. You can crab for dungeonous crabs on eagle beach we did not but you can we enjoyed seeing eagles in the trees",
          "We couldn't believe all the eagles just sitting on the beach. Also perched on wood logs. Took pictures from our balcony on cruise ship. Never thought we would see wo many eagles as we did in Juneau.",
          "Nice views here, but we found more eagles at Sheep Beach at low tide (south of downtown tourist area)",
          "We visited this beach late afternoon on July 3,2017. Great quiet place to walk, hike or stop for a lunch break! Saw many bald eagles and and enjoyed the hike along the beach at low tide.",
          "We saw at least three adults and a juvenile chowing down on a salmon. The background scenery was amazing as well.",
          "Located several miles up Glacier Highway, north of Juneau - this place is very nice and relaxing. The Eagle River, flowing from glacial melt of Eagle Glacier meets the ocean here. There at a lot of picture opportunities, great places to walk you dog, and good wildlife viewing.",
          "what I enjoyed the most...nobody was here. with 4 cruise ships at port, this was wonderful. A slow walk with nature. So quiet and yet so beautiful. The river with the mountains in the background=beauty at its greatest. saw many animal tracks. nice drive out there.",
          "Go at low tide. Saw may Bald Eagles. Beautiful scenery. Nice stop if you have a vehicle for the day.",
          "Large beach area with sone nice walking areas but no salmon this time of year so no eagles. Part of a larger park with good parking and facilities",
          "When we went, there were no eagles at all. I would say there is a time of the year when they gather here, but not in May",
          "Eagle beach can be a bit of a drive out of Juneau but it's a nice drive with other things to do along the way. The Beach is expansive depending upon the tide. Hike the trails, enjoy the picnic tables and watch the birds.",
          "I guess we were unlucky the day we went as we did not see a single eagle or any other wildlife. It is however a beautiful place and I think we were just unlucky.",
          "You'll need a car to go to Eagle Beach. The highway is paved and in excellent condition all the way to the beach. The views are expansive and beautiful. We combined it with a visit to St Therese's Shrine and it was a perfect day. Make sure to go when the tourist crowds are",
          "This beach is 28 miles north of downtown and regular tour vehicles do NOT go this far. A visitor would have to figure out how to get here, but it's good, paved highway all the way. It's very popular with locals, because it's so far out of town that visitors almost never go here.",
          "Great spot to visit as a get away from downtown Juneau. Beautiful scenery--we went during low tide. There were several eagles all around. It's a very peaceful area.",
          "We rented a car for the day and this was our first stop to coincide with low tide. The area is very scenic, and along the way we saw several eagles. Once parked, however, we noticed a family from California were walking the beach with their off-leash dogs, which managed to scare",
          "Standing there with my wife watching the trees over shadowing the beach, we were joined by numerous other \"Eagle Watchers\" observing these magificent birds as they perched on the high branches of the trees. For the longest time you could watch them as they seemed to watch you.",
          "We stopped at Eagle beach as we were told that we would see bald eagles there...yes we did see a few...but it must have been the time of the day we visited...not very early in the morning...but we did see salmon running...the streams were full of dead fish..could see trampled",
          "Nice drive on a well maintained highway. The area is beautiful and the Eagles extremely abundant. Make sure and watch the trees along the side of the highway, that is where we spotted more than actually on the beach.",
          "Easy flat hike and there's a bunch of eagles around. First day in Juneau and we were up close and personal with a real eagle. It's free, peaceful and great way to see how beautiful Alaska is.",
          "I guess it depends on the time of year that you go to Alaska, but I wasn't too impressed. However, I did see some bald eagles on my way there... but they all seem to not want to be at eagle beach.",
          "Eagle Beach is a hidden treasure that we missed on previous trips to Juneau. It's a nice drive out of Juneau to a wide natural wetland filled with birds (yes - including eagles) and offering superb sunset views across sea water and islands. We saw evidence of heavy salmon runs",
          "The area is about what we expected. Near the main delta area there are many many eagles around eating on fish. We saw 15 or so eagles. We also walked along the beaches and enjoyed the scenery of the mountains in the distance. If your looking for a low key place to relax and do a",
          "With awesome views that will make your head spin, tidal flats that allow you to walk and beachcomber for miles, Eagle Beach is the perfect place to spend an hour, day, or even many hours!",
          "Came here while our ship was docked! Hired a car for a few hours so drove out here! Saw a few eagles and lots of salmon > dead and alive! Amazing scenery and a lovely lovely walk! Eagles flew over a few times so great for photos \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "This is one of the nicest places for a picnic in Juneau. Hike out to the beach and bring a picnic lunch or watch the sunset. You will need a car to get here.",
          "This beach was beautiful. If you are staying in Juneau I'd definitely take a drive up to this beach. If you are on a cruise ship, it probably wouldn't be possible. We stayed in a cabin and took the pretty drive up there. I'd recommend bringing a lunch and enjoy the view. We saw",
          "This little beach area is a great spot to see bears... but unfortunately we weren't able to see any! We did see some eagles and salmon.",
          "I live in Washington State, have enjoyed eagle sightings and up-close viewing at the local university animal hospital. But, never saw so many eagles at once, along the highway no less. Magnificent birds.",
          "We had expected to see eagles on this beach, but saw none. Some locals told us the beach was not really named after eagles at all, but was just a recreational area for locals to enjoy. The beach was muddy and not particularly beautiful.",
          "Astonishing numbers of Eagles on the shore hanging out for fish on the incoming tide. Never seen so many in one place",
          "Extremely peaceful state beach near the \"end of the road\" that extends north of Juneau. Bald and golden eagles alike with snow capped mountains in the background. Awesome.",
          "We vissited this place on a rainy and foggy day. It was an impressive experience. Both bold and golden eagles on the beach. No tourists. It is a bit remote and you need wheels. But take this opportunity. You will not regret it.",
          "Was only here for about half an hour, on 2 different occasions. Good place for a picnic, nice view of the bay and surrounding countryside. Very close to the shrine of St. Therese. Worth a visit.",
          "Make this drive! Peaceful, quiet, and spectacular scenery. If you are not a nature lover, you will be when you leave. We had a beautiful, warm, and sunny day. The view to the Chilkat Mountains was stunning! Glacier blue water, and Bald Eagles. The fish were not yet \"in\" the",
          "I think our timing may have been \"off\" but we only saw one eagle here. It was pretty with the water surrounding you and the mountains in the distance. Our group hiked around for about 20 minutes and then loaded up into our van and moved on. I can completely see the experience",
          "We saw a lot of Bald Eagles here, flying , on trees! Amazing! We rented a car when our ship docked in Juneau. It was a great idea as we were able to drive to the end of the highway and saw a lot of Juneau. You will see bald eagles flying above you as you're driving and if",
          "It is very impressive to see how many eagles were gather at once. We watched them catch and eat fish, such an amazing experience.",
          "I had read about Eagle Beach on TripAdvisor, and was glad to give our family an idea for a place to hike in addition to the Mendenhall Glacier paths we accessed from our B&B. Didn't see another human while we were there. Took tons of photos of wildflowers.",
          "Spacious sites for tents and campers. I did not see any hook-ups for electric or water, but I wasn't in need of them. There are showers and places to get water.",
          "Walk along the beach and take deep breaths of clean air. Look for sea glass and tiny anemones. Eagle Beach is pristine and lovely. Lots of locals walking dogs, and when we visit family in Juneau this is one place we always spend time, regardless of weather or season.",
          "This is a bit out of town (Juneau is so spread out- if you are not part of a cruise, you will definitely need a rental car), but was a great place to bring a picnic lunch. There were eagles everywhere. We are from Minnesota and so we see our fair share of eagles, too, but this",
          "Juneau during the summer is packed with cruise ship passengers. It's important to plan your trip around their schedules so that you're not bombarded with a tour bus or two when you decide to go somewhere. This place is far enough that I don't think they go there and not too",
          "My family and I had a great time, observing the many Bald Eagles and other bird species. After a picnic by the water, we had fun watching the time come in. We went on short walks from the parking lot and didn't go visit the camping sites but saw one of the cabins which we",
          "nicely groomed trails, lots of eagles. Cabins to rent if you plan ahead. also tent sites. beautiful place.",
          "This is a beautiful beach, you can't avoid beauty in Juneau but the eagles are mostly far off and you'll need a zoom lens or binoculars for a close up look.",
          "We hiked along the trail on the south side of the Eagle River; the side owned by the Boy Scouts and opposite from Eagle Beach Recreation Area. This level trail parallels Eagle River through the woods and then proceeds through open wetlands and beach. Our hike coincided with warm",
          "A little secluded, there are lots of different places to park and walk along trails, or beaches. Very easy to lose track of time.... bring water and or munchies as we didnt see any vending machines anywhere along the roads. Saw lots of eagles, so bring binoculars to help you",
          "Easy walks, shoes may get wet. Enter 2nd entrance to go closer to beach area. Views of mountains, Eagles, river.",
          "We rented a car and drove all over Juneau and out almost to road end. Eagle Beach was gorgeous, quiet, and so lovely with the lake and snow capped mountains. Eagles in trees but you have to really look for them.",
          "WE stopped and looked at all the eagles out here. Must have been a hundred all waiting for the tide to come in for fish. Very majestic birds.",
          "Nice 45 minute scenic drive from Juneau. A lot of trails worth hiking. Unfortunately I didn't see any eagles. I did see a lot of eagles in Juneau so they all must have gone to Juneau on vacation also. I did see many other types of birds though. Highly recommend taking a trip out",
          "I love this beach not just for the eagles that are there but a great location for a picnic and to watch the sun set. Easily one of my favorite locations around Juneau. A must to get away from the cruise ship dock and enjoy some piece and quiet.",
          "The boat ride was great, had a knowledgeable tour guide which who pointed out Eagle Beach and stopped to tell us a bite about the history of the tiny Island. Then off again further up to be shown where they once logged. We were even shown the tiny marine life on the shoreline.",
          "Eagles soar high above you, yet are also nesting in the immediate vicinity. It is beautiful to see these lovely birds so close up. Much nicer than just looking in a magazine.",
          "It's a bit of a drive out of town but well worth the trip. Wonderful spot to just take in the mountains, water and wildlife.",
          "Didn't expect to see so much wildlife! Eagles and cranes, as well as other birds feasting on salmon leftovers from bears! Drive through entire camping area too! Small cabins for rent. Delta Flats were very interesting to see. Lots of salmon carcasses along the rivers",
          "Our visit to Eagle Beach rewarded us with six eagles, however we were not too fortunate with bears, despite the various locations we visited.",
          "My first full day in Juneau I had access to a rental car thanks to my travel companions. We drove the main drag from end of the road to end of the road (40 miles) making stops along the way. It was an incredibly enjoyable day with many interesting sites. While the terrain does",
          "The person at Juneau Car Rental recommended Eagle Beach as our best bet to see bears during our visit, and we saw a black bear on our very first hike. We hiked to the end of the path by the group campsite with the hill, and the bear was just coming out of the river. He headed",
          "We saw several eagles and finally saw two perched on trees and saw the beach - they have a cabin u can rent.",
          "Nice place to relax and view wildlife or just to relax away from it all. The drive from Juneau is beautiful.",
          "Did not see as many Eagles as trip two years ago, but still nice if you have not see Eagles in the Wild before",
          "Eagle Beach is an easy drive (about 17 miles out the road) from Auke Bay. There is a nice paved walking trail which is wheel-chair accessible and from that you can continue on other walking trails. When the salmon are running, you have a very good chance of seeing bear along",
          "We saw loads of eagles here, nesting in the lush green grasses on sandy dunes around this beach. A lovely area - with superb views of distant mountains across the Lynn Canal and - when the tide's out - excellent eagle spotting.",
          "While we saw no eagles on our visit, the area is filled with other life forms and views. Salmon spawning just below the foot bridge were easily observed.",
          "A bit of a drive from Juneau but well worth it. Great beach walk at low tide because it is shallow and sandy. Public use cabins and campground nearby.",
          "Eagle Beach State Recreation Area is located about 20 miles out from Juneau, near the end of the road. We visited twice, and both times had the place nearly to ourselves. We saw a number of seabirds, ravens, eagles, and blue herons at the beach. There are numerous shelters,",

      "name": "Tongass National Forest",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Tongass National Forest () in Southeast Alaska is the largest national forest in the United States at 16.7 million acres (68,000 km2). Most of its area is part of the temperate rain forest WWF ecoregion, itself part of the larger Pacific temperate rain forest WWF ecoregion, and is remote enough to be home to many species of endangered and rare flora and fauna. The Tongass, which is managed by the United States Forest Service, encompasses islands of the Alexander Archipelago, fjords and glaciers, and peaks of the Coast Mountains. An international border with Canada (British Columbia) runs along the crest of the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains. The forest is administered from Forest Service offices in Ketchikan. There are local ranger district offices located in Craig, Hoonah, Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Thorne Bay, Wrangell, and Yakutat.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve was established by Theodore Roosevelt in a presidential proclamation of 20 August 1902. Another presidential proclamation made by Roosevelt, on 10 September 1907, created the Tongass National Forest. On 1 July 1908, the two forests were joined, and the combined forest area encompassed most of Southeast Alaska. Further presidential proclamations of 16 February 1909 (in the last months of the Roosevelt administration) and 10 June, and in 1925 (by Calvin Coolidge) expanded the Tongass. An early supervisor of the forest was William Alexander Langille.On 4 September 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866 crashed in the Tongass National Forest, killing all 111 people on board.\n\n\n=== Logging ===\n\nTimber harvest in Southeast Alaska consisted of individual handlogging operations up until the 1950s, focusing on lowlying areas and beach fringe areas. In the 1950s, in part to aid in Japanese recovery from World War II, the Forest Service set up long-term contracts with two pulp mills: the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) and the Alaska Pulp Company. These contracts were scheduled to last 50 years, and originally intended to complement independent sawlog operations in the region. However, the two companies conspired to drive log prices down, put smaller logging operations out of business, and were major and recalcitrant polluters in their local areas. Ultimately, virtually all timber sales in the Tongass were purchased by one of these two companies.\nIn 1974, the exclusive KPC contract for 800,000 acres of old growth forest on Prince of Wales Island was challenged by the Point Baker Association led by Alan Stein, Chuck Zieske and Herb Zieske.  Federal District Court judge James von der Heydt ruled in their favor in December 1975 and March 1976, enjoining clearcutting of over 150 square miles (390 km2) of the north end of Prince of Wales Island. The suit threatened to halt clearcutting in the United States. In 1976, Congress removed the Zieske injunction in passing the National Forest Management Act. Over half the old growth timber was removed there by the mid 1990s.The battle for buffer strips, to protect salmon streams from logging, which began in the Zieske v Butz lawsuit, continued through comments submitted to the major US Forest Service Environmental Impact Statements issued in subsequent 5-year intervals starting in 1979, and continuing in the 1988 EIS.Finally, in 1990, a Federal District Court in Alaska, in a case called Stein v Barton, held the US Forest Service had to protect all salmon streams in the Tongass with buffer strips. One of the claims in Stein v Barton for protection of the Salmon Bay Watershed was partially enacted into law when Congress Passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act; however environmental lobbyists compromised with Senator Ted Stevens leaving the most valuable forest available to logging in the headwaters of the salmon streams therein.Much of the power of these companies lay in the long-term contracts themselves. The contracts guaranteed low prices to the pulp companies \u2013 in some cases resulting in trees being given away for \"less than the price of a hamburger.\"\nThe Tongass Timber Reform Act, enacted in 1990, significantly reshaped the logging industry's relationship with the Tongass National Forest. The law's provisions cancelled a $40 million annual subsidy for timber harvest; established several new wilderness areas and closed others to logging; and required that future cutting under the 50-year pulp contracts be subject to environmental review and limitations on old-growth harvest. Alaska Pulp Corporation and Ketchikan Pulp Corporation claimed that the new restrictions made them uncompetitive and closed down their mills in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the Forest Service then cancelled the remainders of the two 50-year timber contracts.In 2003, an appropriations bill rider required that all timber sales in the Tongass must be positive sales, meaning no sales could be sold that undervalued the \"stumpage\" rate, or the value of the trees as established by the marketplace (2008 Appropriations Bill P.L. 110-161, H. Rept. 110-497, Sec. 411). However, the Forest Service also conducts NEPA analyses, layout, and administrative operations to support these sales, and as such, the government does not make a profit overall. Given the guaranteed low prices during contract days and the continued high cost of logging in Southeast Alaska today, one analysis concludes that, since 1980, the Forest Service has lost over one billion dollars in Tongass timber sales. Logging operations are not the only deficit-run programs, however.  The Forest Service likens the overall deficit of the timber harvest program to the many other programs the agency operates at a deficit, including trail, cabin, and campground maintenance and subsistence programs.\nHigh-grading (preferentially targeting for logging the most profitable forest types) has been prevalent in the Tongass throughout the era of industrial-scale logging there. For example, the forest type with the largest concentration of big trees\u2014volume class 7\u2014originally comprised only 4% of the forested portion of the Tongass, and over two-thirds of it has been logged. Other high-grading has concentrated on stands of Alaska cedar and red cedar. The karst terrain often produces large trees and has fewer muskeg bogs, and has also been preferentially logged.As of 2008, the Forest Service has released a new amendment to the Forest Plan for the Tongass Forest.\n\n\n=== Roadless controversy ===\n\nThe most controversial logging in the Tongass has involved the roadless areas. Southeast Alaska is an extensive landscape, with communities scattered across the archipelago on different islands, isolated from each other and the mainland road system.  The road system that exists in the region is in place because of the resource extraction history in the region, primarily established by the Forest Service to enable timber harvest.  Once in place, these roads serve to connect local communities and visitors to recreation, hunting, fishing, and subsistence opportunities long into the future. However, installing roads in the vast wilderness areas of the Tongass is also a point of controversy for many in the American public, as reflected in the roadless area conservation movement, which has opposed further road construction on the grounds that it would promote habitat fragmentation, diminish wildlife populations and damage salmon spawning streams. Further, they argue that existing roads are sufficient.The Tongass National Forest was included in the Roadless Initiative passed on 5 January 2001, during the last days of the Bill Clinton Administration, and the initiative prevented the construction of new roads in currently roadless areas of United States national forests.\nIn September 2006, a landmark court decision overturned Bush's repeal of the Roadless Rule, reverting to the 2001 roadless area protections established under president Clinton. However, the Tongass remained exempt from that ruling. In June 2007, U.S. House members added an amendment to the appropriations bill to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the Republicans for Environmental Protection. Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the amendment, said, \"I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime\u2026 But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense.\"In July 2009, the Obama Administration approved clearcut logging on 381 acres (1.54 km2) in the remaining old growth forests of a Tongass National Forest roadless area. The timber sale was permanently stopped by a lawsuit.In March 2011, Judge John Sedwick from the Anchorage federal district court, in his ruling, reinstated the Roadless Rule on roadless areas in the Tongass, but with three of the Forest Service's recent timber projects excluded from that ruling \"without prejudice.\" Those projects were Iyouktug Timber Sales ROD (record of decision), Scratchings Timber Sale ROD II, and Kuiu Timber Sale Area ROD. The Order concluded in part:\n\nBecause the reasons proffered by the Forest Service in support of the Tongass Exemption were implausible, contrary to the evidence in the record, and contrary to Ninth Circuit precedent, the court concludes that promulgation of the Tongass Exemption was arbitrary and capricious.\nWith the passage of the Roadless Rule, inventoried roadless areas, 'for better or worse, [were] more committed to pristine wilderness, and less amendable to road development for purposes permitted by the Forest Service.'\"\nWhile the Forest Service may reevaluate its approach to roadless area management in the Tongass, it must comply with the requirements of the APA [the federal Administrative Procedures Act] in doing so.\nIn October 2019, the Trump administration instructed federal officials to reverse the limits of tree cutting at the request of Alaska's top elected officials, including Senator Lisa Murkowski and Governor Michael J. Dunleavy. In a statement, Forest Service officials said the new plan would be subject to public comment for 60 days.\n\n\n== Description ==\nKnown by the U.S. Forest Service as the \"crown jewel\", the Tongass stretches across 17 million acres of land and is Alaska's largest National Forest. Alaska Wilderness League describes the Tongass as \"one of the last remaining intact temperate rainforests in the world\". 70,000 people inhabit the region. While the timber industry dominated the economy for a long time, the region has transitioned into \"non-timber... [sources of revenue] such as recreation, subsistence food, salmon, scientific use, and carbon sequestration [which] contributes more than $2 billion\" annually. Tourism supports over 10,000 jobs in the Tongass National Forest, with about 10% being related to fishing activities.Three Alaska Native nations live in Southeast Alaska: the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. Thirty-one communities are located within the forest; the largest is Juneau, the state capital, with a population of 31,000. The forest is named for the Tongass group of the Tlingit people, who inhabited the southernmost areas of Southeast Alaska, near what is now the city of Ketchikan.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe Tongass includes parts of the Northern Pacific coastal forests and Pacific Coastal Mountain icefields and tundra ecoregions. Along with the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia designated by environmental groups as the Great Bear Rainforest, the Tongass is part of the \"perhumid rainforest zone\", and the forest is primarily made up of western red cedar, sitka spruce, and western hemlock. The Tongass is Earth's largest remaining temperate rainforest.  The terrain underlying the forest is divided between karst (limestone rock, well-drained soil, and many caves) and granite (poorly drained soil).\nUnique and protected creatures seldom found anywhere else in North America inhabit the thousands of islands along the Alaska coast. Five species of salmon, brown and black bears, and bald eagles abound throughout the forest. Other terrestrial animals include wolves, mountain goats, ravens, and sitka black-tailed deer. Many migratory birds spend summer months nesting among the archipelago, notably the Arctic tern. Orca and humpback whales, sea lions, seals, sea otters, river otters, and porpoises swim offshore. The Tongass is also home to steelhead and salmon.\nThough its land area is huge, about 40% of the Tongass is composed of wetlands, snow, ice, rock, and non-forest vegetation, while the remaining 10 million acres (40,000 km2) are forested.  About 5 million acres (20,000 km2) are considered \"productive old-growth\", and 4,500,000 acres (18,000 km2) of those are preserved as wilderness areas.Historically, logging operations tended to concentrate on lower-elevation, bigger-tree ecosystems for harvesting; at present, approximately 78% of the land remains intact, i.e. 383,000 acres (1,550 km2) out of 491,000 acres (1,990 km2) original big-tree, low-elevation forest area.  Given the high value of these areas for wildlife species, close to 70% of this old growth forest is protected in reserves and will never be eligible for harvest.Major disturbances in the Tongass National Forest include windfall and landslides. Local winter windstorms referred to as the \"Takus\" can affect the structure of some stands and often cause single-tree blow-downs.\nOf all the old growth in the forest, no more than 11% of the remaining area will ever be harvested.  Of the 5,700,000 acres (23,000 km2) of \"productive old-growth\" in the forest, 676,000 acres (2,740 km2), or 12% of the total old-growth, are slated for harvest over the next 10 years. Current harvesting plans call for a phase-out of old-growth harvesting, to be replaced by rotation harvesting of managed second-growth forests.The Ecological Atlas of Southeast Alaska, published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.\n\n\n=== Wilderness areas ===\nThere are 19 designated wilderness areas within the Tongass National Forest, more than in any other national forest. They contain over 5,750,000 acres (23,300 km2) of territory, also more than any other. From largest to smallest, they are:\n\nThere are three other wilderness areas within the Alaska Panhandle region that are not part of the Tongass National Forest, but are administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. From largest to smallest they are the Forrester Island Wilderness, the Saint Lazaria Wilderness, and the Hazy Islands Wilderness. Also in Southeast Alaska, but not in the Tongass National Forest, are the Glacier Bay Wilderness and a small part of the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness, which are both administered by the National Park Service.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nThe Tongass National Forest offers recreation opportunities, some of which are found only in Alaska. The forest has close to one million visitors each year. Most come by cruise ships arriving through the Inside Passage of Southeast Alaska. The Forest Service provides visitor programs at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau and the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan. The Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, built in 1962, was the first Forest Service visitor center in the nation. The forest interpretive program on the state ferries began in the summer of 1968, and was the longest-running naturalist program in the agency until ending in 2013.\n\n\n== Native inholdings ==\nNative corporation lands are those designated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA).  This Act conveyed approximately 44,000,000 acres (180,000 km2) of Federal land in Alaska to private native corporations which were created under the ANCSA.  632,000 acres (2,560 km2) of those lands were hand-picked old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest and are still surrounded by public National Forest land. These lands are now privately held and under the management of Sealaska Corporation, one of the native regional corporations created under the ANCSA.\nTransference of public National Forest land to a privately owned corporation removes it from protection by Federal law and allows the owners to use the land in whatever way they see fit without regard to the effects of the use on surrounding lands and ecosystems.  This fact has caused much controversy involving the business interests of Native Regional Corporations and the personal interests of local Native and non-Native residents of Southeastern Alaska.\nCurrently Sealaska, a native regional corporation created under the ANCSA is asking for an amendment to the Act that would distribute additional land to Alaskan Natives. When Sealaska was created, it was promised additional land that was unavailable at the time due to contracts with pulp mills; much of this original land is now under water or in a watershed, and consequently Sealaska has requested different land. On 23 April 2009, Senator Murkowski and U.S. Rep. Don Young introduced a revised Sealaska bill (S. 881 and H.R 2099) that requests public lands that are both economically valuable and environmentally delicate.  Starting with the next session of Congress in 2011, Senator Murkowski reintroduced a slightly modified version of the Sealaska Bill and Representative Don Young introduced a companion bill (S 730 and HR 1408). While HR 1408 was passed out of the Natural Resources Committee, S 730 remains in the Natural Resources Committee of the Senate.\nKnown as the Sealaska Lands Bill, the removal of 91,000 acres from the regulatory protections of the USFS and transfer of the land to Sealaska, a for profit corporation, created a huge controversy in South East Alaska.A study released by Audubon Alaska on 22 February 2012 showed that the Sealaska selection of the largest trees in areas designated in S 730 and HR 1408 is 1200 percent greater than the occurrence of these trees in the Tongass as a whole.There is strong opposition to passage of S 881 coming from seven communities in the Tongass, most on Prince of Wales Island. In addition, there are fears expressed by the Territorial Sportsmen that the northern goshawk will be listed as endangered if the bill is passed. Similar concerns were expressed by the Alaska Outdoor Council in letters to Senators Murkowski and Begich and Governor Parnell.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRakestraw, Lawrence (1981).

Theodore Roosevelt (formal legislation declaring it a national forest was signed into law in 1909). Tongass National Forest covers most of the Alaska panhandle and is the largest publicly owned forest in the United States. The forest was named for a Tlingit Indian group. Its approximately 26,560 square miles (68,790 square km), composed of (volcanic) mountainous offshore archipelagos and rugged fjord-indented coastline, include some of the most extensive intact remnants of virgin temperate rainforest in North America. Misty Fjords (or Fiords) and Admiralty Island national monuments are located within the forest.Tongass National ForestTongass National Forest, southeastern Alaska.Henryhartley\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Britannica Explores\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Earth's To-Do List\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Human action has triggered a vast cascade of environmental problems that now threaten the continued ability of both natural and human systems to flourish. Solving the critical environmental problems of global warming, water scarcity, pollution, and biodiversity loss are perhaps the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Will we rise to meet them?\r\n                        \n\n\nFound in association with barren alpine tundra (above the tree line), lowland muskeg, and scores of tidewater glaciers that descend to the coastline, the forest is dominated by towering species of western hemlock and Sitka spruce. Its rich understory includes blueberries, skunk cabbages, and a profusion of ferns and mosses. Brown and black bears, Sitka black-tailed deer, wolves, mountain goats, river otters, mink, northern flying squirrels, seals, and numerous species of birds\u2014including bald eagles, northern goshawks, and the elusive marbled murrelet\u2014are part of the unusual variety of wildlife. Approximately one-third of Tongass has been protected as a national wilderness area, and about one-fifth has been designated for commercial development. The forest has long been the centre of intense conflict between conservationists and logging companies. Fishing and tourism are the forest\u2019s most significant economic activities. ",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Alaska State Capitol is the building that hosts the Alaska Legislature, Governor of Alaska and Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. Located in the state's capital, Juneau, the building was opened on February 14, 1931 as a federal building. After Alaska gained statehood, the building served as the home for the Alaska Legislature.\n\n\n== History ==\nUpon the purchase of Russian America, Sitka, Alaska became the Territory Capital in 1867. After the capital was moved to Juneau, the Legislature met in rented rooms around the city.Construction for a capitol building was partly funded by the United States Congress, but they refused to give more. Local citizens managed to pay the rest of the cost for land, which was then given to the government. Construction on the building began on September 18, 1929, and it ended on February 2, 1931. The building, originally named the Federal and Territorial Building was dedicated on February 14, 1931. It hosted federal services until 1959, where the Alaska Statehood Act granted Alaska permission to settle in the building.The capitol has been attempted to be relocated. These attempts began as early as 1960, where a proposal to move the government to the Cook Inlet area failed. The most recent attempt was in 2002.\n\n\n== Architecture and interior ==\n\nThe building is six stories high and made from brick-faced reinforced concrete, with a facade of Indiana limestone on the first two floors. The portico has four columns made of Tokeen marble from Prince of Wales Island, which is also used for interior trim. Because it lacks the large landscaped grounds of most state capitols, it could appear to be simply an office building. It is one of only eleven state capitols (along with those of Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia) that do not feature a dome.Outside the building is a replica of the Liberty Bell, of the type given to all states and territories by the federal government in 1950 to help raise support for savings bond drives.\nThe lobby features clay murals titled Harvest of the Land and Harvest of the Sea, representing hunting and fishing, as well as a bust of Alaska Native activist Elizabeth Peratrovich. Offices and committee rooms fill the ground and first floors.\nThe second floor houses the chambers of the Alaska Senate and Alaska House of Representatives, as well as committee rooms. The walls feature the work of early Juneau photographers Lloyd Winter and Percy Pond, and busts of the first two U.S. Senators from Alaska, Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening.\n\nThe Alaska Governor and Lieutenant Governor's offices are located on the third floor. The executive office doors are made of black birch, with hand carvings depicting Alaskan industry. The \"Hall of Governors\" features portraits of governors and lieutenant governors of Alaska from the District of Alaska era to the present.\nMore legislative offices and committee rooms occupy the fourth floor. The fifth floor holds legislative finance committees.\nMany areas of the building have been restored to their original 1930s appearance, especially on the second and fifth floors\u2014the latter originally had federal courtrooms.In 2012, the State of Alaska undertook a 4-year, $33 million project to provide seismic upgrades to the building as well as further restore the building to its original appearance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

          "At first it just looked like a regular government building until a tour guide mentioned that it was the state capitol and at the time they were doing some renovations. The tour guide did mention that it was in the top 50 for state capitols which was great for a laugh. I think",
          "Worth visiting. It is small, but a real Capitol in all ways. Interesting, that to gather representatives here is a problem, as the town situated on an island, so they mostly are flying from different places in Alaska.",
          "While in the city museum next door, I was delighted to hear that a tour was starting up in half an hour (self guided also available). Ed, a former journalist shared many stories from his days covering the state legislature. This added a lot, especially as a non- Alaskan. The",
          "While the exterior is an ordinary office building, the inside reflects the varied politics and elected officials over the decades. Quite a few unique photos and artwork pre- and post- 1959 statehood. The building is very welcoming, no cost, no intrusive security. Join a tour",
          "Took a self-guided tour of this place on a rainy day in AK. Glad we did. Interesting and the price is right.",
          "Easy walk from cruise ship dock. Internet not accurate when searched Capitol hours; indicated open 7 days a week, but really Monday through Friday during the summer months. So disappointed to find closed when we arrived to the building. How often does one make it to Juneau. :(",
          "Took a tour of the State Capitol Building and enjoyed the political history of the state. Nice artwork and the lawmakers chambers are small enough you can breeze through this building within 30 minutes.",
          "The building is unimpressive, a rehab of an a non-Capitol building. Of course, it is out of the way now and the Alaskan legislature doesn't do that much meeting.",
          "Although I live in Alaska I have never walked across the street to see the beautiful bronze statue of the bear and a statue and monument to Secretary of State Seward who purchased Alaska. He has a very interesting history in addition to \"Seward's Folly\", the purchase of Alaska",
          "We enjoyed a self guided tour of the Capitol building. Not only is the interior finished with beautiful wood and marble from Alaska but the walls are covered with excellent photos depicting Alaska\u2019s past.",
          "I was surprised to learn that visitors are welcome to tour the state capitol without a guide or security. There is a refreshing sense of trust. I just had to ask the security guard why the capitol is so accessible to the public. His explanation made perfect sense and you'll need",
          "Juneau is the capital of Alaska and their 1930\u2019s State Capitol Building is nothing to write home about .. like our tour guide told us, it\u2019s dome-less and as the local citizens had to purchase the land, it\u2019s on a small plot. It's also a short walk from the cruise ship.",
          "Visited the capital building in July while on a cruise. Nice architecture and accessible to the public.",
          "Worth the time . The wall photos tell an interesting stste history. I have been to many Catitol buildings now including Hawaii, Alaska & Puerto Rico (yes, I know it isn't a stste.)",
          "If you are visiting Juneau by way of a cruise ship, the State Capitol Building is an easy walk away. The building may not be as ornate as many of the state capitol buildings in the United States but it is well worth your time. When you enter you can pick up a brochure that is",
          "When arriving into Juneau, on a ship.. you are overwhelmed by diamond shops which is not why I am in Alaska.. I want to see the authentic people, places and things. I did not once see any signage for this place! I would have loved to have walked through or had a since of the",
          "Maybe a big deal to Alaskans, but I can't imagine a reason any tourist should come here. Some interesting art in the building, though.",
          "Tours of the capital building need to be signed up for in advance at the Juneau-Douglas Museum next door. We had been told when they had tours and said that a specific tour would work will with our schedule. We were not told we needed to sign up for it though. When we came at",
          "Beautiful building and landscape. Great place to go to get away from all the shops along the port. Nice location to take some pictures. Nothing grand or flashy, but very nice.",
          "We were not able to get inside, but it is still a very nice building to walk around and take some pictures when you are on a short walk from your cruise ship.",
          "To note: I did not go IN the capitol building to tour around...I can't speak to that and how the tour was. I have to say that the capitol building itself was, well, boring, compared to all the others I've been to so far. BUT, Juneau itself, the downtown, the area, I fell in",
          "I had anticipated more tourists and visitors inside the Alaska State Capitol building. There isn't much to see or do, but if you like to check off visiting the US state capitols, this is one you don't want to miss if you are in Juneau. There is a special Alaskan-styled",
          "We took several pictures from the outside and then went in and took several pictures inside. I think there is a short tour available, but when we were there no one was at the front desk so we didn't wait.",
          "Interesting to see the state capitol building in Juneau - not what we expected to find. A local store owner told us that it had recently been renovated.",
          "The most northerly capital building? Stopped off on our way to Mendenhall Glacier - right next door to the Court of Justice",
          "You may as well walk into town adn see the Capitol building. You can also see the Gopvernors Mansion and a few other statues and memorials in the area. Also some good shopping and eats.",
          "It was raining the day we landed in Juneau and made our way up to the State Capitol Building. It was quite a surprise when we viewed the building from across the street. This is not an imposing building and lacks architectural detailing and landscaped grounds. It is a very",
          "Since we were in the city on a Saturday, we only could view the outside if the capitol but enjoyed our \"bear\" picture. Knowing that there was no dome as well as the city only could be accessed by sea or air, made this a unique opportunity that we appreciated.",
          "When we visited Juneau's State Capitol you realize this 1931 building housed the territorial government. It wasn't until 1959 when Alaska became a state that the building was designated as the State Capitol. Due to Juneau being accessible only by boat or airplane I found it",
          "Not much to see here on first two floors, offices, some paintings and historical facts. No restoration. Only saw two workers.",
          "In wandering through Juneau, we looked for the State Capitol and were surprised by its exterior appearance. It is a fairly plain structure, six stories high and looks just like a typical office building. It is handsome, though, faced with limestone with a two story portico",
          "We visited one afternoon. Easy to access. We didn\u2019t do a tour. Just a brief look around if the building and outside statuary of Seward and the Brown Bear. An easy visit if you are a fan of capital buildings or state history.",
          "I'm sorry but I don't understand why other reviewers are so hung up about the actual building, surely what goes on inside is far more important than what the outside looks like. Even with a fairly minimalist pamphlet there is enough information available to give you a feel on",
          "This is a rather functional building though it seems somebody has made the effort to at least allow such a potentially prestigious building at least appear a tad more impressive by tagging on a columned front end - though it could be me being too cynical. Anyway worth a look as",
          "We just walked in and after a bit found a guy who opened up rooms and chambers for us to see; there is a self-guiding tour map. Good statue of Secretary of State William H. Seward in park across the way. Seward instigated purchase of Alaska from the Russians.",
          "Imagine a factory building from 1900, then add some columns and a pediment. That's where the pols of Alaska gather every year. It is truly uninspiring as a building. I guess they were trying to save money...",
          "This is an easy walk from the cruise ship docks, and worth a visit. We hope to visit all the US state capitols and get a flavor of the history and uniqueness of each. The speaker's 'office' is a \"must see\"!",
          "Ugly and without architectural merit. Most state capital buildings are derived for competitions or efforts to out achieve other state capitals. Someway must have skipped a page in designing this building.",
          "We took the self-guided tour of the building. The information and photos on the walls are very interesting.",
          "The building is nice to look at but the little park across the street has a bronze statue of Seward - who actually brokered the deal to buy Alaska from Russia for a meager $7.2 million dollars. Also a bronze statue of a grizzly bear eating a salmon.",
          "We had a self-guided tour. It was interesting to see the photos of the various governors. One of the most interesting moments was chatting with Joy who was just outside of the governor's office, and she gave us more insights into the culture, and the government of Alaska. It",
          "From the outside, the Alaskan Sate Capitol building is not that impressive; it looks a lot like an office complex. When one steps inside things don't change that much; not impressive. However, once one starts on the self-guided tour things change. The tour was actually quite",
          "We weren't quite sure what to expect from this tour. When you walk in the front doors there are some pamphlets that tell you about the capital, where to go and what you are seeing. It was really nice",
          "More like an office building than a state capitol. Our excursion driver said it was ranked as the 50th most beautiful capitol building in the U. S. I tend to agree. However, if you are collecting state capitol visits, this is a rare one to check off your list.",
          "I had an excursion driver who dropped me off at the steps in front of the building. There is a doorman inside with a self-guiding pamphlet for the 5 stories. They have post-it notes to do the 'stamp' which is now in my book.",
          "We didn\u2019t have time for an inside tour, but the lovely garden across the street is worth the short walk. Very cool statue of a grizzly! The sign on the door welcomes visitors to take a self guided tour.",
          "Just kidding. This attraction has plenty to recommend itself besides that. But I was curious how the local folks might highlight (of not) their famous Governor, and whether one really could see Russia from there.",
          "If you are debating between this and other things to see, I wouldn\u2019t choose this unless you are a state Capitol fan. It\u2019s neat enough to see if you are in the area with not much else going on. There are pamphlets that provide a free guide of the building. Some fun facts to",
          "This is a very workmanlike state capitol building, which fits the mindset/attitude of Alaskans. It felt more like an office building than a capitol. For that matter, it almost felt more like a county courthouse vs. a state capitol. If you want to say that you have seen a number",
          "Nice history presentation through statues in front of the lobby. Seward and the Alaska purchase, miners and a bear to pose with. It is on the way to the Juneau-Douglas City Museum.",
          "We always enjoy the opportunity to see a state's capital building and this one did not disappoint. The building is open to visitors and each of the 5 floors are full of information lining each wall. It was fun to learn the history of this newer state to our union!",
          "We were in town from a cruise ship. By the time we had finished our excursions, the Capitol building was closed for the day, so we only saw the outside. It\u2019s not as impressive as many other Capitol buildings I have visited. There is no dome or green space surrounding the",
          "Just up the hill from the main tourist area this the state capital building. Not as grand as many capital buildings, it appears more like a office building as there are no green grass grounds around it. There is no admission to enter and you can tour yourself through. People who",
          "I've been visiting the capitol buildings around the country and this was my 43rd. It doesn't have a rotunda or dome like many other state capitols, but it has some interesting artwork and exhibits. There's a small plaza outside with a new statue honoring William Seward and his",
          "Had the opportunity to visit the Alaskan capital building in Juneau and it was very interesting. It's a self guided tour with a brochure pointing out everything to see with explanations. Even got to go into their House and Senate chambers. Beautiful old heavy thick doors",
          "I have seen a few (very few) State Capitol buildings, and this one, unsurprisingly, is not one of the most impressive. But this is a small state, by population, and everything is relative. You can show yourself round for free, and the building is easy to find the town centre.",
          "A nice free activity in town. Guides are high school students. You are able to get up close and personal here.",
          "ON a stop on our cruise ship we went here. The guard was happy for us to look round. Interesting stuff all round.",
          "The Capital is another place that is just a short walk from the pier and it is literally right in the middle of town. Not much to see as it is a working office building but worth the time to swing by and see on your way to several other museums.",
          "This building is worth to visit and you will get a little brochure and can do the tour by your own. You will find some nice architecture, historic details and I have enjoyed my visit. This is one of the best things you can do in Juneau.",
          "So the Alaska State Capitol Building is not as ornate as others but it was nice. It was quiet and the legislature was not in session. There's a brochure at the front desk with a summary of the self-guided tour. Start at the 5th floor and continue down the stairs. The self",
          "This was our 49th state capitol building, and it was really nothing special. A little local art work. Had the Liberty Bell right out front.",
          "You can go to visit the capital, they offer tours or you can do your own tour with the brochure . It was very interesting and I could have taken more time if I wasn't rushed.",
          "I enjoyed this tour even more than I thought I would. Some interesting architecture, photographic history on the walls, etc. This tour is worth 45 minutes to an hour and is easy to do \"self guided\" using the brochure they hand you in the lobby/reception area.",
          "While in Juneau I walked to the State Capitol. Just a short piece from downtown Juneau. While there also walk and see the Govenors Mansion.",
          "So pretty really worth seeing. It houses the House of Representatives, The Senate Chamber and the Governors Offices.Outside is a replica of the Liberty Bell.",
          "A great Art Deco building with great collections of art and historical photos on the walls. A very useful guide is given to you at the front desk.",
          "Walked through the Alaska State Capitol building during a shore stop on our Alaskan cruise. Employees inside the Capitol were friendly and helpful with info.",
          "We didn't go inside, but it is always fun to Visit a state capital and see what pomp and circumstance is visible. The building isn't anything extravagant. Still...always interesting.",
          "Even though not really attracting, inside there are some facilities. We had a coffee, we used the toilet, we looked around to see some Alaska objects and finally going to the terrace you have a nice view of the city.",
          "We were surprised to find that the Alaska state capitol is open for the public to walk around. You can see the senators' and representatives' offices and the respective meeting chambers. Worth a visit for the curiosity.",
          "This was surprisingly approachable and educational. When you enter the building, you are offered a free self-guided tour. Follow it, you will get a great glance into Alaska's history and views of its art. The folks who work there are friendly and open. Plus they have 2 old",
          "Our family of eight including a 10, 8 and 4 year old visited the Capitol while in port on an Alaskian cruise. Everyone was friendly and pins of the state were given to the children. We were able to tour the building on our own. We met Dan Sadler, representative of one of the",
          "The capital building is open to the public and has free walking tours. It's definitely worth a visit if you have an hour free and want something convenient to do while in the area. The building is right in town and easy to access. You can get a guide from the front desk and walk",
          "Beautiful wood work, craftsmanship and art. The detail on the carved doors was amazing. I would recommend a visit here over a museum.",
          "We wanted to get a photo of one of the legislative chambers to add to our collection and I approached a staffer at his desk who promptly unlocked the door to the senate chamber for us. It was interesting see just 20 desks as Alaska has the smallest senate in the US.",
          "Juneau, this city is bigger than a state (Delaware). We walked around the city and stop by the capitol Building! Check in the spot! It's good for our daughter to visit her 3rd state building :) It's not as grand as California's state capital building and not as important as",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect but the hour we spent in the State Capital building was a good experience. There is a printed tour guide available at the front desk. You are allowed to visit 3 floors on which you'll see art depicting Alaska scenes, historical photos, a brief",
          "Small Capitol, easy to access from downtown for a self guided tour, when not in session. Enjoyed Alaskan art work and historical exhibits on every floor.",
          "I love visiting State Capitols so I jumped on the chance to visit this one when we were in Juneau for a few hours. I was happy to hear it just re-opened after a multi year renovation! Very casual place to visit - you walk in the front door, no security, and you can take a",
          "It is an easy walk around Juneau to find the interesting sites like the State Capitol and the Governor's Mansion. They aren't anything spectacular compared to many state capitols that we have visited, but still nice to show kids some history of a state.",
          "The architecture is beautiful, but like many other capitol buildings I have seen across the U.S. The staff here were very friendly and accommodating. Although this is not my kind of tour, we came as a small group and enjoyed ourselves. My friends who are into this kind of thing",
          "The Boss & I went by the place when you were up there on a cruise. From what little we could see of it. It seem to be interesting looking site. So instead we wandered around the small town of Juneau, AK. To tell you the truth I had a hell of a good time while there. The",
          "Like to take in the capitols when we're passing through different states. Really thought with all the money that Alaska has their state capitol building would be better than it was.",
          "We were just walking around town and came across this building. It was completely under scaffolding and they were replacing the facade. We didn't go in, but stood outside and watched them work on it. It will be very nice once they it get it all completed.",
          "When our cruise ship docked in Juneau, one of the things we wanted to see was the state capitol building. Juneau has a beautiful scenic setting. We walked from the dock. It was somewhat hilly but we were able to walk leisurely and observe the downtown area. We had not",
          "At least while the building is under construction, there isn't much to see other than a bunch of scaffolding. We were walking in the area so stopped by, but it's definitely not worth any extra effort. There were some nice small park/statues on nearby street corners, so we",
          "We didn't realise the building was being renovated until we were upon it. What we could see of it was interesting - I would have loved to see the new marble pillars but they were under wraps.",
          "Walked from our cruise ship down to see this building to find the streets around it closed and the whole building practically wrapped in plastic. Very small Capitol Building. I had seen it 10 years ago and wanted to revisit it. It is currently undergoing massive renovation to",
          "The state capitol building is unlike most other capitol buildings found in the lower 48. It looks more like an office building. The structure is still undergoing some repair.",
          "Saw this item in our 3A book, and it was enjoyable. Also, if you walk across the 8th floor and go out, you will be on the hill close to the Capitol and local stores.",
          "On my wife's quest to visit all 50 state capitols, we stopped by while on an inside passage cruise. The building is still under renovation and you cannot get inside to view the interior. The exterior, while not in the mold of what one typically envisions a Capitol to look like,",
          "The State Capitol Building is not really much to see right now, as part of it is under tarps being rebuilt, and it doesn't even look like much when it's NOT being re-built. I wouldn't make a special trip up to see it, even if nearby.",
          "As state capitols go, this one is really ugly. The architecture is ugly concrete, and the whole building is stained with some ugly black stuff. Just an overall ugly building.",
          "One side of the building seems to be done revealing what the rest of the building facade will look like someday. It's currently closed and not used during renovation. The City Museum across the street has a room devoted to proposals dran up and canceled over the past 50 years",
          "We were unable to go into the building due to it being renovated. It is not a fancy building and one would not know it is the capitol building unless being told or seeing the sign. Progress on its rehab seems to be going slowly.",
          "The capitol was undergoing renovation and not only could we not go in, it was completely shrouded and we couldn't see a thing.",
          "I enjoy visiting State capitals especially those built in a grand style, unfortunately the Alaskan State Capital in Juneau is undergoing a face lift and I couldn't get inside. Signs indicate construction is to be completed in Summer '16, but as you can see by my photo, that may",
          "This Alaska State Capitol building doesn't look like most other capitols (no dome, etc). it looks like a pedestrian downtown office building.",
          "A nondescript office building under construction and closed to the public when we were there. Just walk by for a bit of exercise but nothing to write about.",
          "Whether or not the building was interesting before the current construction is not relevant. Fact is that State Capitols are a great vehicle for civic pride and explaining history. Juneau and Alaska has failed it's many visitors by seemingly making no effort to to arrange for",
          "Not really much to it but administrative offices and the building itself. A small capitol for governing a small (by population) state.",
          "be warned, the front of the building is under construction. Good news, its not that far of a walk so we just burned off some of the thousand calories we'd consumed on the ship buffet. :)",
          "Interesting to see the capitol of Alaska where the Governor presides. Was not able to tour inside the structure as it was closed to visitors.",
          "Couldn't tour the Capitol building since it is presently under renovation. Except for the four large pillars outside the front building, it looks like a very nondescript office building. There is no dome.",
          "The building was being renovated when we were here, but none of us could believe this was the state capitol building for any of the states of America. Don't waste your time/money to tour unless you need a picture for a collection or a lost bet.",
          "We stopped by the Capital to take a picture and unfortunately it is completely covered by scaffolding. It was a nice walk from the cruise port.",
          "The state capitol usually offers free tours and is just a short walk from the cruise ship docks, but it is undergoing construction this summer and likely will be closed to the public. Worth having a look from the outside anyway...local granite and marble went into the",
          "During our visit, it was closed for tours. We were not able to ask questions because it appeared that the staff were on break that time; we can't find anybody. The fact that we were able to get in and took some photos was good enough for us.",
          "This beautiful Historic Capitol is located at the corner of 4th & Main Streets in downtown Juneau, directly across from the Dimond Courthouse, Juneau City Museum, and the large State Office Building. Currently 2015~2016 renovating and retrofitting the structure. There",
          "This was just \"something to see\" while we were wandering around Juneau. Inside is some historic information and small exhibits but overall, nothing too special...",
          "If I remember correctly even the tour guide said that it was rated the ugliest capitol building in US. Even if that is wrong it's not really impressive to look at. Better to enjoy some other highlights",
          "My parents, my wife, and I visited the Capitol Building on our Alaskan Cruise. I found the tour very informative and love how they allow for those all over Alaska to participate in their government. Allow at least an hour for the tour, and ask questions. The tour guides are",
          "Visited in June 2012. They have tour guides! The young lady that was our tour guide was very knowledgeable!",
          "It may not be as impressive as some other capitol buildings but I thought it was pretty. It is under construction so there were no tours. We just drove by as we were looking for parking.",
          "The building was in the process of renovations when we visited and as such could only gain access to the front foyer and lobby area. An employee gave us a brief history of the building",
          "The State Capitol Building is still under a long-term renovation project - seismic upgrades ++ You can't see much at the present time.",
          "My wife and I arrived just after nine in the morning for our self tour. When we entered the building the was a pamphlet on a desk, explaining the self tour, and you were invited to tour on your own, which we proceeded to do. We saw some of the offices, but it was obvious there",
          "Looked cool, wanted to take pictures of Alaskas Capitol and see where Sarah Palin worked lol. Was closed and under refurbishment.. Should be nice in future",
          "We were very disappointed to find the Capitol not having tours, especially after walking 6 blocks uphill in the rain! We were allowed into the lobby where there are several interesting carvings, and we saw Alaska's copy of the Liberty Bell just outside the building. So sorry",
          "In Juneau, we took a walk uphill and more uphill (there was a better route) to the State Capitol. Oh what a disappointment. It is under renovation and all that you can see is a very small lobby. On the desk is the stamp if you are doing that at State Capitols. That's it! Before",
          "The capitol is currently closed. Can take photos of the front and step into the foyer. Renovations should take two years. My sense is the capitol is very much like any administration building with some flourishes.",
          "It's not open for tours cause it's under renovation! The hours were even listed on the one page downtown map. I think it's closed for 2 years. We did get to use the bathroom.",
          "We were disappointed that we did not get to do a Capitol tour. This building is being renovated and there was very limited access. I don't know the expected completion date, but you should check before you plan to go.",
          "It is under renovation. Very limited access. It does have a small give shop. Don't expect much. It is more like a normal office building. This is our 43 capitol and it is by far the most un-impressive.",
          "Houses our State lawmakers. The Scottish Rite Temple next door was reconstructed into more office space with a sky bridge to join the two buildings. It is well done and a nice area.",
          "Currently undergoing renovation and a remodel the capitol is under construction and nothing is accessible.",
          "I like to visit state capitol buildings. This was a good stop. Small building. Good artwork. Nice folks everywhere.",
          "The State Capitol offers a lot of information about Juneau and its founding. There are Native art works and beautiful relief sculptures of Juneau's history. The building is being renovated and lacks luster at this time but is well worth visiting. The staff are friendly and",
          "Beautiful architecture. A bit different than I expected but it is a very nice building in the heart of downtown Juneau. Near the governor's mansion.",
          "The guide did an excellent job of shortening the free capitol tour to half an hour so we had enough time to walk back to the cruise ship. In that I was in elementary school when Alaska became our 49th state, I thought it was fun to hear about the details and view the art work,",
          "We walked in without checking in and did a self guided tour. It was a little strange since our statehouse (Indiana) seems to be on lockdown with guards and sign in sheets, metal detectors, etc...We just wandered around and went in chambers, and up to the Governor's office.",
          "state capitals are normally great places to visit, but this one is about like a below has been office building in a midsize town",
          "Free hourly tour if you need to get in out of the rain. The building is beautiful and the free tour includes access to many areas of the legislative chambers that are very interesting to see. Not entertaining enough for kids though.",

          "The building may be unattractive (it was originally an office building for the Alaska Territory, never designed as a State Capitol, so no dome) but the tour is excellent. Of course, this depends on the tour guide's knowledge and enthusiasm. Our young guide, Evan Wood, was",
          "I wanted to get to downtown Juneau and just take a peak at what was going on. We had a 3 hour layover on the Alaska Maritime Highway. As it turns out, the only way to get to Juneau from the AMH terminal is via a $35 (one way) taxi ride. Bus service or other normal tourist",
          "The capitol is just a \"ugly\" former federal building, however, the real charm is on the inside. The inside tells and shows the history of Alaska's statehood. I learn and enjoyed my stop by the AK capitol.",
          "I didn't actually go into the building, so I don't know what the tour is like, if there is one. The bus driver on the way to one of our Juneau excursions said the Alaska State Capitol building was voted the ugliest capitol building in the U.S., and I don't hesitate to believe",
          "I enjoyed the knowledge of the person who gave the tour. I wish I got his name. He was very interesting and enjoyed sharing some of the stories behind the photos and surroundings in the chambers. A great tour to take for sure when in Juneau.",
          "I used to give tours at the WY Capitol so I like to check out other capitol buildings when I can. I was absolutely shocked when we found the Alaska Capital building. Sadly, besides the pillars out front there is no indication this building is anything more than a regular office",
          "Probably the most unattractive capitol in the US. Pretty sure that this was designed and built by East Germany.",
          "It was surprisingly interesting compared to what I thought it would be. The tour was nice and it was a small group. The building seems boring, but like all capitals, there was a lot of history and details.",
          "This roughly half hour tour is interesting and informative. Two of us got a personal tour immediately because we were tight on time. The building is ornate and the story about the state flag creation was worth the time alone.",
          "We were very happy that we took the time to visit the State Capitol, and take the free tour that was given by one of the very knowledgeable young guides who were there this summer. When we went we were in a small group of only three, so our guide had plenty of time to answer our",
          "If you want to know a little more about Alaska, it's politics and it's politicians, this is a great tour. The guides are really knowledgeable and personable. The tour is very informative and well worth the time. They give you a historical perspective of Alaska that is well",
          "This was a free tour and it was excellent. Our group of 6 independent travelers were thrilled to get out of the rain, but it would have been worth it on the prettiest day as well. Our guide was very thorough and knowledgeble. So glad we happened upon this worthwhile,",
          "noon the organ is played. song of yesteryear & the acoustics unbelievable. there is also the state library where you can look up old micro-scripts of historical articles & photographs! there is also coffee shops (2x) & you can get a bite to eat as you enjoy the noon performance!",
          "We are history buffs and have toured quite a number of State Capitols, so we had to do Juneau. As expected, there is no dome and it doesn't compare in majesty to many others. We really enjoyed the tour and the guides' pride in Alaska's statehood. It was the territorial office",
          "Coming from Michigan where we cannot do this, it surprised me that we were able to wander all over the capitol building on our own! We enjoyed the old pictures and reading about the history of the building but did it in about 20 minutes. Most interesting was how the governor's",
          "A nicely done, simple tour given by a local. The legislature isn't in session much - so you're mostly getting a history lesson and a view of the building. As such, nicely done. Note: In Summer 2014 the building was under extensive renovation so there were areas we couldn't",
          "The AK Capitol building used to be a Federal office building, so it's not visually stunning and the architecture is basic and nondescript. It is nice to visit just to see the legislative offices but if you aren't an Alaska, I don't think you would care. It would just feel like",
          "It is very small and very plain compared to other State Capitol buildings. The tour was very good and it is only a short walk from the cruise ships.",
          "Those who have been to a variety of states capitals know that the state capitol building usually is large and has some sort of dome. Not so in Alaska. In 1931, the United States government constructed the Territorial and Federal Building to handle business before Alaska became",
          "The kid giving the tour was really nice, but you don't get to see a whole lot on this tour, I think it took about 20 minutes, plus the Alaska capitol is frankly kind of boring compared to other state capitols I've been too. If you have a half hour to kill out of the rain, go",
          "We veered off the tourist path and walked to the state capital. They said it was open for you to see it and they mean it! Everyone there was happy to see us and wanted to guide/direct us to whatever we wanted to see. You can wander around yourself or take a guided tour with a",
          "Nothing over the top - turned an old school into legislative offices. Nice to see some fiscal responsibility for a change! The San Fran city hall is way more overdone and much larger.",
          "I don't expect an old building coming from the 49th state, but I was disappointed in seeing a normal modern building. Their was no character in the design. If your into architecture an design of buildings this is not worth going to see.",
          "I toured the state building with a group of students and it was the most welcoming experience I've ever had with kids. The building went out of their way to not only give us a tour, but to also meet different representatives in person.",
          "Very interesting tour of the state capital. The tour guides are very knowledgeable. We worth the visit.",
          "The state capital of Alaska isn't that imposing of a building and it was having a face lift when I visited. However, it is easy to access and has some wonderful historical photos and artwork. The chambers for the state senate aren't that impressive, too new and small.",
          "We took a chance to see the State Capitol building during our Saturday visit.....surprised by it being open. We were able to either take a free guided tour or walk around on our own. We were able to visit the Chambers of the Legislature and the Hall Of Governors. We got a chance",
          "It was nice to see all the offices and stuff, and explore around the state house. There are so many artifacts and interesting things to read around the whole building.",
          "We always tour state capitol buildings when we visit capitol cities, so we made time for the statehouse in Juneau. The building is currently undergoing work on the front exterior. On a day in late July, the columns did not support anything, and work was obviously in progress.",
          "We have started visiting state capitol buildings on our trips, and we are learning a lot. Alaska has an interesting history, and our guide was very good at explaining it. The building is undergoing MAJOR renovations so we had to enter through a back or side door, but when the",
          "With the exception of marble columns in front, it looks just like an old office building, with no dome, rotunda, etc. Our guide was dynamic and gave us great information and some history of Alaska. He was a theatre major, and he had appropriate Alaska jokes and witticisms that",
          "We\u2019d recommend it. It\u2019s free and informative and especially so for anyone who remembers when Alaska became a state. The building dates to territorial days (it opened in 1931). Construction in the area, use of a side entrance and a less-than-grand appearance might cause you to",
          "We've tried to visit state capitol buildings in our travels since my nineteen year-old daughter was small and this had all the trappings and history of the state government. We stopped in as part of a self-guided walking tour through the town. Pictures of past leaders was",
          "The site was under construction so even the main entrance to the building had been moved. With the construction, do not bother to go out of your way to see this site as, like us, you won't see anything!",
          "Our bus driver mentioned that the capitol was somewhere, but didn't really point it out. Later on, back on the cruise ship, my husband found a picture of it on the internet. It doesn't look like any other capitol building, but more like an office building. Nevertheless, it",
          "Would like to see without all the construction going on around the Capitol, and to the Capitol without construction. Alaskan folks say they like simple and it is that. I just have an interest in our state Capitol buildings.",
          "There was construction outside so we did not get a good view of the building but the inside was open for visitors. We did not opt for a tour, although it was available. Enjoyed walking through the building,",
          "If you are in the area and have the time then stop and take a tour but it is not very impressive. I don't recommend that it be on your must-see list.",
          "The staff is incredibly friendly and the tour was lengthy and informative. The high level of detail in the capital building and emphasis on local and tribal artifacts is excellent. I would highly recommended adding this to the trip itinerary.",
          "If you are into government/ politics, this is an interesting tour. Coming from a state with many more residents, the small scale of the house and senate chambers was surprising. Be sure to take in the photos along the walls. Taken years ago by local photographers, some of the",
          "Even though they were doing major renovations and construction we thoroughly enjoyed the tour. The guide was thorough, efficient and very knowledgeable and pleasant.",
          "Interesting...as Alaska is the largest state but really has a less than impressive state Capitol. Guess we were expecting more. The bldg is old and was undergoing renovations but they won't really change the basics of the bldg. Not a problem really just was surprised.",
          "Was surprised at how plain this capitol building was... Also, they do not let you just roam around and look at it. you must take a tour.",
          "While we were in Juneau we went to the Capital several times to meet with our representatives. I really like the building but they seriously need to think about moving the capital to the Anchorage area before they start spending money remodeling the current capital.",
          "I was excited to visit the State Capital for the first time. I did get lost, but people througout the building were friendly to point me in the right direction (they probably see lost people all the time). Beautiful building. Got to see our legistature in action by sitting in on",
          "Very impressive, the centre of the action when the legislature is in session, the little parks close by are nice for lunch for just sitting",
          "We stopped at the State Capitol Building while in town for the day. It was raining, so it seemed like something to do indoors. There are better things to do than go here, since there is not much to see inside, but they do have a short, free tour for visitors and you are not",
          "very cozy and small tour groups so easy to hear tour guide-great historical photos-far cry from huge offices in lower 48",
          "While this is not the most elaborate capitol building, I did find it very interesting. The fact that there were no metal detectors or major security was amazing to me. I was allowed to wander through the hallways on all the floors without anyone questioning me to what I was",
          "It was raining, so we couldn't hike Mt Roberts so we did this instead. Let me say that I enjoy history and the background of things, but this place just didn't have much of any of that. It was pretty utilitarian. It was however free, so what can you really expect.",
          "We had a very informative guided tour and really enjoyed seeing the building...we were also very impressed that in Alaska, all state business is conducted over a 90 day period, Now how much of an inspiration should that be to other state and federal governments??",
          "Even though the building was nothing to write home about, the tour and the guide that we had were great. She was so nice and was very proud of her state. It was funny to hear and see the reactions of the people on the tour when we went into the 20 person Senate chamber! A bit",
          "After a morning visit to the Mendenhall Glacier, make sure to stop in at the Alaska State Capitol. Nice young tour guides will show you around - you'll be amazed how accessible the legislative offices are. Interesting that the whole state is managed from this small building.",
          "Only worth the walk up the hill if you are like me and want to tour the 50 State Capitols. As State Capitols go, this one is ranked in the bottom 5. Tour guy was upbeat and friendly, which made up for a lot.",
          "We didn't take the tour but just went inside and looked at the ground floor. All the marble is from Alaska. It's beautiful.",
          "Kind of forgettable by state capitol standards. Looks like a average size high school. The tour was short and informative though.",
          "For such a huge state geographically, the Capitol is shockingly small and understated. I did my own tour, rather than the organized one, and if you're a politics or history buff it's a pretty interesting place. The office provided a pamphlet, and you can freely browse the",
          "We were given a guide to tour us thru the 5 floors of the capital. There were 3 of us to begin with, then a foursome showed up and really slowed things down. We completed the tour by ourselves. Was not able to see the Gov's office because they were working.. Interesting pictures",
          "Juneau has a lot to offer the independent traveller and a well sign-posted walking tour will take you around all the downtown points of interest including the Capitol, City Museum & Governors Mansion. A great option if you don't want to spend a fortune on guided tours.",
          "We stopped by the Capital building and Governor\u2019s Mansion on a short walk from the downtown cruise ship area. It was quite small by California standards. Unlike California, they must operate efficiently. We also went around the corner up the street to the Governors Mansion",
          "Its free for tours, our guide was very interesting. It's a typical state house, but Alaskas past is different than most of our states. So the commentary was then different and very interesting. Its beautiful too.",
          "Someone suggested we stop here and we were very glad we made it our first stop in our walking trip through downtown Juneau. We took the tour through the Capitol and learned a great deal about Alaska politics, Juneau events and local sites. The guide did a great job and people",
          "Fantastic tour, self-guided of the multi-floored center of Alaska government. Being from the East Coast, I had to ask - and this was a Saturday - where is your security? Simply walk in, get a tour map, and off you go. No pat-downs, no wanding, no TSA type of screening. Am",
          "We did not time our visit for the free tour, but roamed around the building for a few minutes. The exterior is rather bland compared to most state capitols I've seen, but I really liked the whole ambiance. There was a hilly walk from the ship to the capitol and we enjoyed",

          "The building is beautiful and the tour guide we had was knowledgeable. It is a short tour, but well worth the time to visit the State Capitol building.",
          "...the walk is beautiful. Nothing against it, and no offense intended, it's just that there's a ton of cooler things to see/do in Juneau if you have limited time off the cruise ship. If you feel, however, like you have eaten so much on your cruise ship that you feel like the",
          "We stumbled into a tour when we visited and got an excellent synopsis of Alaska's history. Our tour guide (Max) was extremely well informed. Was well worth the time.",
          "We enjoyed this free tour of the Capitol Buidling. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and provided a lot of information about the uniqueness of Alaskan government. The tour is concise and takes about 30 to 40 minutes. The guide invites lots of questions. A great civics",
          "Very solid looking building very much worth the walk to photograph it. I didn't go inside but I understand you can. Dont miss the bear sculpture just below in Main Street. Walk a block further to St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, a beautiful little church. While you are",
          "I really liked there tours -- we did this on a rainy day. Your learn how they became the 50th state, what makes up Alaska's income, how each member of the senate/house must vote they can not skip a vote like other states in the union. The give regular tours so you won't have",
          "We had a free day in Juneau and it was raining so we took the free tour. Knowledgeable guide and interesting history. Gives you a good understanding of the population (or lack thereof) of the state and the newness of their government.",
          "Why travel all the way to Alaska to visit the State Capitol Building? Got me. For us it was because it started to rain and it looked like it would be dry inside. Fortunately, it also was pretty interesting inside. While the outside of the building isn't much to write home",
          "The guide that gave this tour was energetic and informative and made history come alive. I would definitely recommend this tour.",
          "I confess, the title for this review was literally the first that popped into my head and has nothing to do with my opinion of the place. The capitol building is actually more of a capitol campus, made up of a former federal building and other nearby historic buildings donated",

          "We hiked multiple trails around the day lodge during the off season for skiing. Beautiful forested trails. A bit of a drive from Juneau.",
          "While you can't depend on the snow you can expect the staff to be amazingly helpful and kind. The snowsports school does an amazing job teaching kids and the books2boards program is perfect for this town.",
          "Went sightseeing in the evening . Its just beautiful on the mountain with lots of wildlife along side the road.",
          "Eaglecrest is a fun place to ski with a little something for everyone. Depending on the weather of course, there may be wonderful powder off the groom trails for advanced skiers or groomers for the kids and novices. Last winter was a bust however. No snow to speak of.",
          "This is a nice easy wide-trailed hike to do in the summer, with rewarding view to the west. We picked blueberries along the trail. Some small ponds and shade made this a great hike for a summer sunny day. Up and back not a loop. On Douglas island.",

          "Since we were at Eaglecrest Ski Area during the summer it was nice to take the drive out to the area on Douglas Island and take in the beauty Mother Nature has provided along the way. We didn't have time to walk but enjoyed going to see the area and the improvements. A must to",

          "Aside from Eaglecrest, I have skiied at Altenmarkt in Austria, Purgatory in Colorado, Mt. Baldy in So. Cal, NorthStar in No. Cal, Jay Peak in Vermont, Whistler in BC, Snoqualmie in WA, and Hilltop and Alyeska in Alaska. I think Eaglecrest is by far my favorite. Perhaps it is",
          "...our local mountain! It's typically amazing snow and zero lift lines. Nice laid back atmosphere and you feel like you're part of the EC family when riding.",
          "I'm not a skier, but my wife and I have driven up the mountain just for the views. It's prettiest on the way back down, when you can clearly discern the silty stream coming into the ocean from the Mendenhall Glacier melt off. There's a progression of tree species as you ascend",
          "Average because it is really best for skiing, not for warm weather visits. This is Juneau's ski area. It is really not a destination in non ski times unless you want to do a zip line. Since you need a car to get there, or have to pay for transportation if you are on a cruise,",
          "Eaglecrest is a very good ski area, with the best downhill opportunities (ski and rreat groomed X-C ski trains also; lift lines are short. From the top you can see water on both sides. The access road is ok, and there's a bus because it's about 7 miles out of town. This has",
          "Not enough snow for skiing, but the drive there was an opportunity to get out of the downtown cruise ship area. Enroute, I noticed a colorful fence made of old skiis. The zipline company uses some of the ski facilities.",
          "Have skied here for the past 25 years-- great mountain, fun people, challenging runs and lots of off piste.",
          "The only ski hill in town. The menu at Eaglecrest is limited and the food is standard fried fast food but it is good, cheap, fresh and there is plenty of it.",
          "We drove over to Douglas Island, headed north, and turned to climb up to the ski lift on a very good road through the forest. Snow was still heavy in the forest in May and its melting created numerous waterfalls and bustling streams. Delightfully, we were the only ones on the",
          "I understand it's a scenic spot to drive and hike for free in the summer. During ski season it is a busy place, with affordable passes, rentals and lessons. The employees are well-trained, efficient, and friendly. Thanks to the generous support of Juneau's citizens, whose"

        "wiki": "The National Shrine of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se overlooks the Lynn Canal in Juneau, Alaska, US. Situated on 46 acres, the site contains a stone chapel, crypt, labyrinth, columbarium, lodge, cabin, and retreat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1925, St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux was named the patroness of Alaska. In the 1930s, the Jesuit priest, Father William LeVasseur came up with the idea of a retreat center in her name. Bishop Joseph Raphael John Crimont provided support for its establishment, buying federal land. Thousands of stones were used to construct the chapel and other structures, which were gathered by volunteers. The first mass was held in 1941. In 1945, Bishop Crimont died and was buried at the shrine's crypt.In 1953, Bishop Robert Dermot O'Flanagan started The League of the Little Flower to help make the shrine self-sufficient. The shrine fell into disrepair and stopped holding retreats in the 1960s but underwent renovation under the leadership of Fr. James Manske from 1968\u201369. For financial reasons, the shrine was forced to close in 1985 but reopened the following year after 25 locals came together to save the shrine.In 1998, the columbarium was built and is open to all Christians who want their cremains placed at the shrine. In 2000, a new cabin was built to commemorate the Great Jubilee, and in 2001, the Merciful Love Labyrinth was built.On October 1, 2016, Bishop Edward J. Burns announced that the Shrine of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se had been raised to the status of national shrine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Shrine of St. Therese, Juneau at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

          "This sacred location is a must see when in town. The drive from Juneau to the Shrine of St. Therese is beautiful! We walked around to enjoy the grounds and got to see a family of Marmots, visited the gift shop and just sat to watch the sea. Tranquility at its best.",

          "My wife and I had some extra time when there recently and was delighted to see this shrine even though we are not Catholic. This is a beautiful serene area and just its location is a religious experience. Take your camera for pics of the shrine and walk out to the point to get",
          "Loved the little journey to get there. The only problem was there were a few groups that did not show any respect to the serene and sacred setting.",

          "We were on a cruise and we were lucky enough to get a car rental for the whole day in Juneau. Most cruise folk don\u2019t make it out here (since they don\u2019t have a car reservation) because it\u2019s a bit out of the way - but absolutely no issue if you have a car. We packed some lunch and",

          "I visited here for the sake of getting pictures for a friend who is devoutly Catholic. As for me, I am a free thinker and have no need for any organized religion, but grew up Catholic. I forgot how many Stations Of The Cross there are, but this place has a monument the size of",

          "If you have a car & the time, you have to visit this place. Take Glacier Hwy past Mile Post 22 & its on the left. The views of Auke Bay are worth the trip. Flower garden and parking lots are maintained by volunteers & they have done a wonderful job.",
          "A place with touching history. A chapel built on a tombolo, enriched by firs and vegetation. Chapel is opened for prayer and meditation. Don't miss the Via Crucis in the garden, perfectly fused with the natural environment. Surely the labyrinth let you have a refreshment of your",

          "What a treasure nestled in the forest - a beautiful spot to contemplate the beauty of Alaska. We saw whales from shore.",
          "This site is not easy to get to unless you have a rental car. It is about 22 miles from downtown Juneau on Highway 7. Just an amazingly beautiful, serene, and peaceful place. The Chapel is up on an 'island' after walking along the causeway. The Holy Grounds with Stations of the",
          "This place was beautiful. Stations of the cross were very pretty. We saw a marmot on the rocks near the shore. Good hiking around the spot. The rainforest is very lush behind the chapel down to the shoreline. Go down there!!",
          "We happened upon this unique spot at the recommendation of Juneau locals while on a layer from a Alaska cruise. We tend to shy away from \"Cruise Tours\" and usually rent a car, talk to locals and venture out on our own to track down the less touristy sites. Well, this one did",
          "We went as a family group and that day was a bit unfortunate since it was alternating between light rain and cloudy skies. Even though the weather was windy, it made the view so much prettier in my opinion. You can actually go in the Shrine itself, but I chose not to. There's a",

          "If driving out the road, definitely take 10 minutes to stop at this beautiful place. The caretakers lovingly tend the flower gardens every summer and the location (in any season) is breathtaking. There are clean bathrooms (\u201creal\u201d toilets; not porta potties) and near the",
          "This was my second time to the shrine. My sister and I had visited 9 years go. I knew I wanted to bring my husband. It is a beautiful location. The shrine is so peaceful. The information our driver gave us was very informative.",
          "We visited based on a recommendation from our Airbnb host... what a nice way to spend an hour or two. Whales breaching off the coast, marmots following us about, a wonderful labyrinth to enjoy with my family. You don't need to be religious to appreciate the shrine... simply",
          "My husband and I stopped at the Shrine of St Therese while driving to Eagle Beach north of Juneau. We didn't stay long due to rain and didn't see everything on the grounds, but what we did see was beautiful and interesting. Stations of the cross were scattered through the",
          "I did not expect such a profound feeling of calmness. A caretaker stated that we just missed a whale. The 3 minute walk to the church was equally beautiful, and welcoming no matter what ever denomination you are affiliated with. It is perched on the edge of a cliff, and the",
          "This is a beautiful & quiet place to take at least a moment for inner reflection. The walk out to the chapel gives one time to take in the unique view of the chapel sitting on its island. Enter the chapel, when the door closes behind you the sounds of the outside are gone. Let",
          "The Shrine of St. Therese was such an amazing surprise. This was my third trip to Juneau and we rented a Jeep which allowed us to take off on our own adventure. This is one of the most peaceful places I have ever been and it is set in absolute beauty.",

          "Would see again, quiet and peaceful. Beautiful location not too far from town. Walking trails for quiet reflection.",
          "I am not a religious person but was well worth the visit. Beautiful place and views. Did not go into the church as they were having a service. Eagle Beach is right down the road by about 5 minutes. Worth taking a few minutes to go there too.",
          "You don't need to be religious to take inspiration from the beauty of the location. We visited on a gloriously warm, sunny day in May, perfect !",
          "The drive up from Juneau is very nice along the coast. The \"shrine\" area is very peaceful and beautifully located. Nice to visit if you have some spare time and are interested in the history and legacy of St. Therese",
          "About 30 mins north of Juneau, this place was a tranquil, albeit windy oasis. So peaceful, it really facilitated a reflective space to just enjoy the beauty of nature in that region. The chapel, and all of the ground, reflect St. Therese pretty well. Simple, humble and",
          "This was my favorite part of our visit to Juneau in March 2018. A lovely, peaceful, beautiful place!",

          "This is a beautiful location to visit on a trip \u201cout the road\u201d from Juneau. A small chapel on a spit of land, built on a rise overlooking the water. There is a path around the chapel in the woods demarking the stations of the cross and you are sure to be sharing the walk with",

          "The gardens were very pretty and the area is very pretty. We were the only ones there and there were several ravens around being very loud. The ravens made it a little spooky, so we just walked around for a minute and then left. If you have extra time though it is worth the",

          "We went on a gray day and at low tide so the walkway to the chapel didn't have water lapping against it. The chapel interior was all wood from floor to ceiling and the exterior was stone. The fireplace in the back of the chapel was located near the confessional. The moss covered",

          "We really enjoyed walking on the grounds here. The gardens are beautiful and we especially enjoyed the scripture verses.",
          "Definitely recommend visiting this place. Serene atmosphere and lovely. I met a family that chose this place for their son/brother. I offered the mom a prayer and we did. She thanked me and we hugged. Id like to think this place and my prayer brought them comfort.",
          "It is about 10 mile north from Juneau airport. The shrine is set at the beach in the woods. The shrine itself is just modest and nothing special. The setting makes it more unique I think. But maybe because it was a rainy day, we cannot see much view from the beach. I actually",
          "Was there later evening and the sun shining through the trees unto the stations of the cross was very cool and very serene. Walked the labyrinth and visited the columbarium. Great views of the water here and definitely worth a visit.",
          "Even for a short visit, it's worth walking out quietly to the shrine/chapel, along the shore, and following the labyrinth.",
          "A colleague took me out to visit the area during a stay in Juneau. It was amazingly beautiful with awesome views. Each prayer station was uniquely and simply adorned. With the trip out to see it!",

          "This old church is set out on a peninsula into the ocean. It's a neat little church that you can go inside of. The atmosphere is very serene with giant old trees surrounding it. We watched the seals playing out in the water and on our way back there was a grizzly bear bathing in",
          "There is something for everyone here. Beautiful gardens, an historical church, a spiritual center, lovely views of the ocean, even a labyrinth (my favorite). It is so peaceful and beautiful. You can visit for an hour, bring a picnic lunch and let the kids run, or even book a",

          "This is a beautifully simple church. Easy to park and walk to. It's perched on the point surrounded by water. After walking around the exterior and reading all the stations of the cross, then spending some prayerful time inside the church, we sat at the picnic table and enjoyed",
          "I thought this was a odd choice to take visitors but turns out it's well worth the walk across the gravel bar to the island. If you have a bible background this will have special meaning to you.",
          "Dennis from Custom Juneau Tours took us to this Shrine of St. Therese. I had no idea what to expect but am so glad we went here. The area is amazing and the chapel is inspiring. Evidently they hold retreats out here; what a fantastic place for a retreat! It's a beautiful",
          "This is an absolutely gorgeous spot just north of Juneau. Has a beautiful Chapel, gorgeously carved Stations of the Cross, a prayer maze, and cabins that can be rented for a retreat. We just walked through the property and spent about an hour there and loved the peace, quiet,",

          "It is a very pretty church built in the 1930s. However, I wouldn't go out of your way to get to it. We stopped by as we were on our way to Eagle Beach. Highlight of the visit was spotting whales and a sea lion.",

          "This is a beautiful place right on the water. It's landscaped with gorgeous flowers and a short walk to the quaint rock church, shrine and viewing point. Easy drive from Juneau or Auke Bay and not much to do here, but on a nice day is a beautiful place to bring a picnic lunch.",
          "After getting off the plane, we rented our car at Juneau Car Rentals (great value), bought food for a picnic... and then we drove N up the Juneau Coastline. this was a quiet, beautiful, restful stop on our journey.",
          "We rented a car and was able to drive here some 12 miles away from the cruise ship. Very scenic area , stone church, harbor seals and fishing boats around us. Would recommend if you have a car rental for sure.",
          "What a beautiful and serene place. Watched an otter playing from the walk way, I swear he was putting on a show!",
          "This is another beautiful spot to visit, with so many things to see. The stations of the cross are outdoor works of art that are just amazing! They are large (5-6 feet tall?), built of stone, with carved pictures. Wear sturdy shoes, as the ground can be uneven. There were at",

          "It's quite a ride from downtown Juneau, but it's really a peaceful little enclave away from the bustle of the city. The stone chapel is located in a small grove facing the ocean. Allow around 15-30 minutes to visit. I imagine that it's a perfect place for retreats.",
          "A trip to the Shrine will rejuvenate a person's soul--even if he or she is not a religious person. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained with beautiful flowers and native plants. Walk the rosary path for spectacular views of the ocean as well as meditative prayer. But",

          "Need I say more? Most likely you were stuck on a plane to get to Juneau, or worse a cruise ship. It's good to stretch your legs and this is that place. If you are time limited, I'm not sure how you could work in a visit, because its approximately 23 miles outside of Juneau. But",

          "We went here by accident as I had not really realized what it was. It is a beautiful little church on a small island with the stations of the cross and a garden. It is Catholic, so I would recommend it for anyone interested in Catholic churches.",
          "If you enjoy visiting beautiful religious shrines in scenic locations, this is one you'll want to see when you are in the Juneau area. You can drive into their parking lot and walk the causeway to the shrine on what was probably an island before. Or, if you are disabled, you can",
          "Beautiful spot, very peaceful, quiet. Well worth the stop. Would like to have spent more time. Great place to wonder around and take some nice pictures. The church is quite something. Not touristy at all.",
          "It could have been a great stay but the sewer made it less attractive because of the smell. Warning not to go into the sea because of this, came to my attention on the way back. Beds not to good, positions even stranger.",
          "We stopped by on our drive. It is in a beautiful location and very peaceful. We watched a whale from shore. It is a great place to stop for a visit.",
          "An absolute must while in Juneau ! We were glad that we drove up here to this beautiful and charming shrine in a wonderful setting indeed. I think one would miss something by not visiting this out of the world Shrine.",
          "If you are in Juneau you shall visit this shrine, it is far form the city, you will need a car, but it is worthy the visit. The place is beautiful, relaxing and inspiring. Views are excellent as well as the small chapel. Do not miss it.",
          "Be sure to go to the arboretum next door (beautiful spot). This whole area is just one of the most beautiful spots on earth. You have to take a cab or tour out there. About a 30 minute drive.",
          "Quaint, a bit remote. Worth the trek only if you have personal transportation.Might spot some wild life, including whales, from the vista point on the premises, if you get lucky!",
          "Well kept grounds with picturesque small shrine/chapel located on a small isthmus off the main property. Beautiful setting and apparent retreat location for Catholics.",
          "North of the Juneau airport there is a place that should not be overlooked. The Shrine of St. Theresa will only take about an hour out of your day. I was the only person there until I was leaving. The church construction is fitting for the surroundings. It is built on a island",
          "A unique church, it is built out of the stone and cedar from the environment that surrounds it. The tree roots form staircases around the Shrine, and you almost forgot that you are surrounded on all sides by the Pacific ocean. You cannot help but feel serene and thoughtful",
          "This was a beautiful spot on the water, fairly well maintained. We saw some ravens, and walked the ground a little bit. I can see why this would be used as a retreat house.",
          "Came here while our ship was docked! Really peaceful and very pretty! Lovely look around and was very surreal! The place is well looked after and views from the lake are to die for! Highly recommend :)",
          "Our cousin took us here when we were visiting her in Juneau. You walk out on a small trail to a wooded island. The shrine is in the middle of a lovely grove of trees, surrounded by water and a spectacular view. It is worth going out here to see the site and feels very private.",
          "I had heard about this place and had to come check it out for myself. Quiet, peaceful, beautiful surroundings. Easy walk. Great photo opportunities. Do it!",
          "This is a very peaceful and serene place to visit. The views are spectacular as well. There is a lot of area to walk around if you choose to but isn't necessary. Very calming place.",
          "This was an unexpected surprise visit which was so beautiful. I would highly recommend spending some time walking around there.",
          "We rented a car in Juneau and drove out to the Shrine of St. Therese. It was a very scenic and peaceful place.",
          "This is really a retreat center with several paths, gardens, cabins, and the like strewn out over the waterfront about 30 minutes from town. The little jewel of a stone chapel is located down a fern-lined path just across from the mainland. It is very quiet and soul-satisfying",
          "This was one of the things to do on my wife's to do list in Juneau and it was totally worth the drive. We decided to rent a car on a beautiful sunny Juneau day to enjoy the sites and we must say it was worth the drive, its extremely beautiful and the history behind it is great!",
          "Don't miss this beautiful setting, the stone chapel is beautiful. Wonderful natural scenery. I could go out here every day.",
          "There was a neat little walking path leading to an observation area where we could see sea lions and whales across the bay.",
          "Beautiful place which is an easy stop off the road. However, if you have done any other hiking in Juneau along the shore this isn't anything new. Good stop if you haven't done any other hiking, but otherwise not a must do.",
          "We visited Juneau on a cruise ship stop. Rented a car specifically because we wanted enough time to visit this shrine. Juneau was our shortest port day, and we would have loved to have had more time to spend at the Shrine of St Therese. We had stopped at the salmon hatchery and",
          "Hadn't really heard of this before but was part of a tour package. Beautiful wooded sanctuary..peaceful calm and gorgeous views.",
          "So you have to be respectful and not make much noise this is one of the rules here. Your allowed to visit and look around. This is such a beautiful place and so are all the landmarks. Really worth the long ride up",
          "Lovely place to take a short stroll and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the shoreline, bay and mountains. The shrine is a beautiful structure and the setting is spectacular.",
          "Arrived. Walked down the path. Walked over to the island via the path. Visited the chapel and a few of the stations. Part of our tour with Patrick and Eric from the Adventure Flow Tour Company of Juneau.",
          "a local suggested going there, its about 13 miles past the glacier but is a great spot for photos and if your a religious person, the 12 points of the cross are pretty cool as there up the hill near the church in a cool spot",
          "This is a lovely retreat and nice to visit. It is a little far off the beaten path. There are probably more interesting and exciting sights to see if you time is limited unless you visit for the religious aspects of this retreat.",
          "Our tour guide, Dennis Harris, took us to this chapel on the inlet and it is a really neat spot to visit. The stations of the cross around the grounds are remarkable and the entire area surrounding the chapel is breathtaking.I highly recommend this if time allows.",
          "This place is quite nice with a little walking path across a causeway to a point on the water with an overlook affording a gorgeous panorama of the water and the surrounding mountains. There are several paths to gardens with labeled plants. It's a peaceful getaway from the",
          "Great place for enjoying nature and reflecting or contemplating on the beauty of the world. Amazing natural setting and interesting buildings. Check out the walk across the creek to to the south for a lovely garden.",
          "This place is very peaceful feeling and so beautiful just to stop and smell the flowers take in all that is there that God created for us to enjoy. This place brings a relaxful feeling you don't get every where. Simply tranquil",
          "Beautiful place about a 30 minute drive north of Juneau. A Catholic retreat for the diocese, but visitors are welcome to walk the grounds. The church is on a very natural island accessible by a causeway. short religious themed trails like labyrinths and stations of the cross.",
          "This is a beautiful shrine on the waters edge in juneau. So peaceful beautiful stone structures and gardens.",
          "Make the drive out to this property. It has spectacular views. Relax and recharge as you take in the natural beauty that surrounds you. The chapel is beautiful and simple. Easy walking around the property. Bald Eagles and Ravens welcome you as you walk under the trees.",
          "It's a small shrine on a tiny island by the water. It's really a unique place to visit if you want to stay away from the cruise ship crowds. You do need a car to get there.",
          "For a truly enlightening hike this is a must see. It is a trip of about 20 miles from downtown. Beautiful sun or rain.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and tranquility here. The Shrine is very nice and makes for outstanding photos. The grounds and gardens are just lovely with many beautiful flowers and water all around you. Great for a short stop to stretch your legs!!",
          "Beautiful and peaceful, off the beaten path. Our private tour took us here, and there were no tour buses.",
          "It's been on my list of places to go in Juneau. Was not disappointed. The place was very serene and peaceful. I think they hold retreats in the cabins nearby. It's a beautiful place. We had rented a car for the day so we were able drive to the shrine.",
          "This is a nice play to add to your visit if staying in Juneau for longer than a few days. Nice to say you have been here.",
          "A beautiful, serene, and tranquil setting. Can walk around the area in an hour to 90 min. Has a small gift shop, but we didn't go in so I can't comment on the contents. Beautiful chapel on the grounds. Several trails though the woods including several monuments to the victims of",
          "This area is about 15 miles from downtown Juneau and 8 miles from the airport. Very pleasant stroll in a peaceful environment. Beautiful views.",
          "Awesome view of the bay, incredible peace in the atmosphere and surroundings. The environment is indeed relaxing and meditative, a welcome retreat from busy schedules and opportunity to quiet oneself.",
          "We had mentioned to our charter boat deckhand that we were going to drive to Eagle Beach. She suggested we stop at the Shrine. Glad she told us about it.",
          "Breathtaking views and so serene. The church and Stations of the Cross were beautiful. You get a feeling of utter peace while visiting this sanctuary.",
          "This is a must-go place in Juneau, a pocket of peace and solitude. When we visited, a retreat was happening in teh retreat house and we strolled the grounds, said a prayer in the beautiful chapel and breathed the fresh Alaska air. I understand at times one can see whales",
          "The place is very peaceful, you really feel a connection with the nature and yourself, you have a great view.",
          "This is not a touristy place but mostly a place of solitude for locals and visitors. It's absolutely beautiful and quiet. Glad there are no big buses with noisy tourists. The church is hidden inside a small peninsula and is not discoverable from the road. It's always open. You",
          "We only spent about half an hour but that was plenty to walk the grounds and visit the church. The stations of the cross are beautiful.",
          "The shrine church is on a little peninsula with great views of the water. It looks like the church is sitting in a magical, enchanted forest. The walkways are all through gnarled roots of giant trees. So much history. It is awe inspiring. Don't miss this little gem!",
          "This is a bit out of town- you need a car to get here, but it's great paired with a trip to Eagle Beach for a picnic. If you are Catholic, a VERY worthwhile trip. It's a beautiful stone shrine to St Therese and has Stations of the Cross on the property around the shrine. You",
          "We only visited the shrine briefly, taking the time to walk around the grounds and visit the church. It's a wonderful place for some downtime, reflective moment.",
          "very peaceful and beautiful place to visit! beautiful trails, nice restroom, lots of parking, right on the water",
          "I'm not much of a religious person, but even I felt awed and inspired by the beauty of St. Therese. Covered with beautiful trees and deep silences, it is a wonderful place to contemplate and worship. Plan for several hours here as there are plenty of paths to explore. Make sure",
          "This site was recommended by a local and I am so thrilled that they did. Located about 22 miles north of Juneau downtown, you must have a car or take a taxi out there. But, well worth the travels. Simply amazing views, beautiful gardens, a scenic chapel out on Shrine",
          "Like a lot of places in juneau, or most of alaska for that matter, the shrine is located on a very peaceful, calm, beautiful landscape, with the holiness factor added to it, makes for sone quiet time to meditate and refocus. Very welcoming, parking available, restrooms, and a",
          "The views and location were so beautiful it was well worth the short drive, at least on the sunny day that we were lucky to experience. There is a retreat as well as a shrine at the site, situated on the water with views of the mountains. It was a peaceful setting to sit and",
          "We drove out here on a calm and warm June afternoon and found much more than we expected. Not only is their a shrine, but their is also an entire retreat complex, manicured grounds, prayer stations, and a stone church. All but the retreat buildings are located on a small and",
          "We picked this spot because I wanted to get out of town and see the Juneau countryside, and coming to this secluded shrine was a delightful surprise for all of us. It was like a fairyland with its heavy moss-covered trees around the chapel. The various biblical scenes were",
          "Even if it's raining in Juneau, it might not be at the Shrine. Lovely place for the whole family any time of the year. You often see whales here.",
          "The Shrine of St. Therese is a small chapel in a beautiful location, very peaceful and serene. Worth the drive out if you have the time.",
          "The chapel is located on small island (accessible by a dry foot path) on a beach with the most scenic environment ever !",
          "A hidden gem, beautiful gardens, stone church hidden in the trees next to the water. Kids loved the walks and playing on the rocks, could see some water life playing too. Seals and maybe a whale.",
          "This small country church can be accessed by car. Handicapped accessible but up a slope. The quiet area gives a special charm and sense of peace.",
          "I had a few hours while in town for work so I went to see this shrine that happens to be dedicated to the same saint as my home parish. It is absolutely beautiful. I spent over two hours exploring and meditating. The chapel is out on an island connected by a land bridge. It is",
          "Beautiful, quiet grounds to visit while in Juneau. Out on the little \"island\" is the chapel and stations of the cross. The landscape here along the coast is worth stopping to visit.",

          "Despite the rain, we had a nice visit to the shrine. The chapel and grounds are beautiful and tranquil.",

          "This little church is set in the middle of the woods. It is a great place to find serenity and beautiful pictures. While walking to the church we saw a beautiful eagle sitting in a tree about 25 ft from us.",
          "Beautiful gardens and serene surroundings. From several points you can watch whales and Eagles. This is a must see while visiting Juneau.",
          "This place would be a great place for a retreat. The grounds are amazing and I took piles of pictures of flowers. I was not able to walk a lot and there are more trails etc. leading to more to see but even just sitting by the water was renewing.",
          "I live 15 miles away from the Shrine and it is one of my favorite spots in Juneau. I always take adult visitors here. (Older children might enjoy it, but younger kids, probably not so much. There are also steep cliffs and rocky coast, and no play areas.) The chapel is on an",
          "Worth a brief stop if you are on the 7 highway, but not worth a special trip in my mind. Catholic parishoners may feel differently and I could understand.",
          "The Shrine is an excellent place to visit. The architecture and location are breathtaking and it provides a wonderful spot for prayer and introspection. Highly recommend",
          "If you have a rental car, this is a must see stop. It's far out of downtown Juneau (about 26 miles north), but well worth a visit. A very scenic and quiet chapel sits within a wooded area on the coastline. You do have to take a short hike from the parking area, but it's",
          "Peaceful area to enjoy the day away from the crowd. Pack a picnic and eat there or a few miles ahead at Eagle Beach.",
          "A quick walk to a small island with stations of the cross and a chapel. It was build by a person using stones from the local area. A nice meditation spot or a place to soak up some Mother Nature.",
          "a quick walk to a small island with stations of the cross and a chapel. Picnic tables on the water, and restrooms. Also a labyrinth. A nice meditation spot or a place to soak up some Mother Nature.",
          "Short walk and a beautiful view. The parking lot is just off of the highway and the trail is a short one, but worth it for the view and peaceful serenity. The chapel is quite beautiful and a feat of construction for its location! Stations of the cross are scattered around the",
          "There are ample grounds to walk around and watch for passing whales. Among other things there is a maze to stroll around and meditate...and of course the Church. There are accommodations but one has to call ahead and reserve.",
          "Located on a beautiful spit of land, this is a very quiet, peaceful and serene site. Good for a picnic and exploring the shore line, especially at low tide",
          "The sanctuary is beautiful and the point is so peaceful. No wonder everyone wants to get married here.",
          "What a place. I went on a Sunday. There were people singing Amazing Grace. That was my moms funeral song so it was very special to me. A must see for sure",
          "This was my favorite place to visit during our trip. Stopped here on the first day and spent way more time than I expected. It is absolutely beautiful and so amazing the amount of work that people did here. It was so peaceful, lots of benches to just sit and watch the many birds",
          "It was a nice scenic 30 minute drive to St Therese from Juneau. There is a chapel along side the bay hidden amidst the tall trees. It's a beautiful place to visit and be one with nature. Beautiful views of the bay and mountains and bird watching also.",
          "As a Juneau resident, we've been here on rainy, clear, and foggy days. I still love it! Absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and free! A must see if you can get yourself out the road.",
          "The Shrine of St. Therese is part of the larger cathedral of Mother Nature surrounding it. The natural grace of the Lady welcomes you to participate in the inner silence as you walk the Stations of the Cross through the forest. At the end you stand gazing at the sea, a place to",
          "This is a place that exudes a very spiritual commitment to a coastal development. There is a very comfortable air amidst numerous religious displays and a quaint chapel hidden on an island copse. While it will take some time to make the drive from downtown, it is well worth a",
          "I live in Juneau and one of the first places I visited was the Shrine of St. Therese. I loved it. It was a dreary day with drizzling rain so not much to see around with the clouds hanging so low. I walked around the church following a little path. There were hardly any",
          "I love this place. The grounds are gorgeous and the church is beautiful. From the parking lot it is about 1/3 mile walk out to the church itself. The church is a quaint stone building with a wood interior. This location is also excellent to watch the sun set over the mountains.",
          "Peaceful, beautiful, breathe of fresh air. Words do this place no justice, it's top of my list for completely favorite place ever!",
          "It was so wonderful to be able to walk along the well beaten paths and feel at peace. We looked out at the water and saw many seals bopping in the water. It was a magical experience.",
          "This picturesque shrine is located on a small peninsula. After parking your car, you have to walk about 1/3 mile out to the actual church. The setting and the stone shrine are lovely, and are a nice contrast to the touristy vibe by the cruise ship docks. The area has great",
          "Closely located to Mendenhall Glacier.. Nice walk to view another set of mountain ranges. We saw much wildlife in the waters from the viewing points.. The church itself is very beautiful and supplements the natural surroundings.",
          "I came across the Shrine sort of accidentally when driving north on the road, as I'd never heard of it before. The location is beautiful, as is the chapel. This isn't a \"tourist\" destination. It's a retreat center and shrine, with a small labyrinth. They generously welcome",
          "Even in winter, this place is beautiful. Peaceful spot. 2nd time visiting here. We were able to watch eagles, whales and sea lions from the shore. The chapel in the woods is like something out of a fairy tale. No matter what your religion, if any, this is a quiet place to",
          "We stopped by the Shrine as a last minute side trip. The grounds are pretty. We were able to see whales in the water off the back side of the church and stayed for a while watching them.",
          "Beautiful stone church hidden in the pines. Very peaceful and beautiful sight. Well worth the drive!",
          "Every time I visited this place, it is very quiet, relaxing and peaceful. Great place to enjoy a picnic and for smaller kids to explore the tidal pools at low tide.",
          "I thought the setting was beautiful and the pathways were serene and well kept. The church was gorgeous and I would recommend the short walk to anyone looking to slow down for a minute and reflect on life and its meaning. Leave politics out of it",
          "We went with 5 kids and no one got bored. Went through the stations. Did the \"maze\" and just walked around and relaxed. It's beautiful and peaceful here. Don't miss it!",

          "We visited last August while in Juneau to bring our daughter home after a year of service working with the local Tinglit population. This had become one of her favorite places to go to reflect. It is quite lovely, with a small chapel. The setting is gorgeous, and we observed",
          "Super cool destination to check out when in Juneau. We were here in March and everything was covered in a light coat of snow. We saw sea lions and seals playing in the water near the shrine. Beautiful and quiet",

          "The church and the surrounding areas and walkways are stunning. Very peaceful area for reflection and meditation whether you are religious or not this is a must see. The area out by the water has an awful smell the kind of ruins the ambiance.",
          "Just driving out to the north end of the road is an Alaskan treat. Often weather is a bit better as you go north of town. Anyway hopefully you stopped at Lena Loop picnic area for a potty break and view of the cove. Then off to the Shrine. You don't have to be Catholic to",

It is a historic house museum operated by the state of Alaska, memorializing the life of James Wickersham (1857-1939), an influential political leader in Alaska in the early 20th century.  The house, a 2-1/2 story frame structure, was built in 1899 by Frank Hammond, owner of a mining company.  It was purchased by Wickersham in 1928 and remained his home until his death.  The house has been operated, informally at first by Wickersham's niece, as a museum since 1958.  The house was purchased by the state in 1984.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and was included as a contributing property to Chicken Ridge Historic District in 1995.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to House of Wickersham at Wikimedia Commons\n\nWickersham State Historic Site",

Now it is under Diocese of Alaska of the Orthodox Church in America.\n\n\n== History ==\nRussians did not settle in the Juneau area while this territory was a Russian colony (1784\u20131867). Nor did the Russian Orthodox Church send missionaries to Juneau when the mining settlement started in 1881.\nInstead, the Orthodox Church became strongly established here through the efforts of the local Tlingit leaders. In 1890, the Taku leader Anathahash traveled to Sitka to be baptized into the Orthodox faith. More traditional Tlingit gravitated toward the Orthodox Church among Christian offerings, as it had used local languages in worship since about 1800 in Kodiak and 1824 in the Aleutian Islands. The Holy Scriptures and much of the Divine Liturgy (as the Orthodox call the Mass, or Lord's Supper) had been translated into Tlingit by St. Innocent (Veniaminov) during his years as a priest in Sitka (1834\u201340) and later as Bishop of Alaska (1842\u20131850).\nAnathahash returned from Sitka in 1890 with the Rev. Vladimir Donskoy, the first Russian Orthodox priest to conduct services in the area. During Fr. Vladimir's stay, he instructed and baptized many of the local Tlingit people. That year Alexei Yaakwaan, son of a Tlingit leader, converted to the Orthodox Church and encouraged his father, Yees Gaanaalx, leader of the L'eeneid\u00ed (Dog Salmon) people of Auke Bay, to be baptized. Sitka Chief Khlantych told the church that Yees Gaanaalx wanted to convert to Orthodoxy and that Tlingit would follow his example.\nOn July 26, 1892 Bishop Nicholas (Ziorov) of the Aleutian Islands and Alaska (1891\u20131898), visited Juneau from San Francisco, where the seat of the church in America had been located since 1872. The bishop was met by the Tlingit leaders wanting to convert. According to oral tradition, he was told that the Tlingit leaders had each been having a common, recurring dream.  In their dream, a short, white-bearded, elderly man encouraged them to become Christian. When these leaders saw an icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, Archbishop of Myra in Lycia, they \"recognized\" him as being the man in their dreams. Three days later, the Priest-monk Mitrofan baptized both Yees Gaanaalx and his wife, giving them the Christian names of Dimitri and Elizabeth. Following their example, some 700 of approximately 1500 Tlingit in the area also converted to the Orthodox church.\n\nWith such a large Native congregation to be served, the Orthodox Missionary Society in Russia sent architectural drawings, interior church furnishings \u2013 such as candlestands, a chalice set, censers, banners, a full iconostasis (the icon screen), and festal icons \u2013 and two hundred silver rubles to support construction of a church for them. The six large panels on the iconostasis are the original icons received from Russia and hold a unique position as the only known iconostasis where the deacon's doors depict Sts. Cyril and Methodius rather than either the Archangels Michael and Gabriel or the Deacons Stephen & Lawrence.  The newly baptized Tlingit and Serbian gold miners, who were already Orthodox, helped build the traditional structure. It is a high-quality example of the \"Russian Colonial\" style of architecture. In June 1894, Bishop Nicholas returned to Juneau and consecrated the new church in honor of St. Nicholas.\nOn June 5, 2016 Bishop David (Mahaffey) at Saint Nicholas Church with Alaska Governor Bill Walker and First Lady Donna Walker opened of a new monument erected in memory of the many Aleuts who lost their lives in internment camps during World War II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. AK-59, \"St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, 326 Fifth Street, Juneau, Juneau Borough, AK\"\nHABS No. AK-59-A, \"St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, Priest's House\"",

        "wiki": "The Alaska State Capitol is the building that hosts the Alaska Legislature, Governor of Alaska and Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. Located in the state's capital, Juneau, the building was opened on February 14, 1931 as a federal building. After Alaska gained statehood, the building served as the home for the Alaska Legislature.\n\n\n== History ==\nUpon the purchase of Russian America, Sitka, Alaska became the Territory Capital in 1867. After the capital was moved to Juneau, the Legislature met in rented rooms around the city.Construction for a capitol building was partly funded by the United States Congress, but they refused to give more. Local citizens managed to pay the rest of the cost for land, which was then given to the government. Construction on the building began on September 18, 1929, and it ended on February 2, 1931. The building, originally named the Federal and Territorial Building was dedicated on February 14, 1931. It hosted federal services until 1959, where the Alaska Statehood Act granted Alaska permission to settle in the building.The capitol has been attempted to be relocated. These attempts began as early as 1960, where a proposal to move the government to the Cook Inlet area failed. The most recent attempt was in 2002.\n\n\n== Architecture and interior ==\n\nThe building is six stories high and made from brick-faced reinforced concrete, with a facade of Indiana limestone on the first two floors. The portico has four columns made of Tokeen marble from Prince of Wales Island, which is also used for interior trim. Because it lacks the large landscaped grounds of most state capitols, it could appear to be simply an office building. It is one of only eleven state capitols (along with those of Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia) that do not feature a dome.Outside the building is a replica of the Liberty Bell, of the type given to all states and territories by the federal government in 1950 to help raise support for savings bond drives.\nThe lobby features clay murals titled Harvest of the Land and Harvest of the Sea, representing hunting and fishing, as well as a bust of Alaska Native activist Elizabeth Peratrovich. Offices and committee rooms fill the ground and first floors.\nThe second floor houses the chambers of the Alaska Senate and Alaska House of Representatives, as well as committee rooms. The walls feature the work of early Juneau photographers Lloyd Winter and Percy Pond, and busts of the first two U.S. Senators from Alaska, Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening.\n\nThe Alaska Governor and Lieutenant Governor's offices are located on the third floor. The executive office doors are made of black birch, with hand carvings depicting Alaskan industry. The \"Hall of Governors\" features portraits of governors and lieutenant governors of Alaska from the District of Alaska era to the present.\nMore legislative offices and committee rooms occupy the fourth floor. The fifth floor holds legislative finance committees.\nMany areas of the building have been restored to their original 1930s appearance, especially on the second and fifth floors\u2014the latter originally had federal courtrooms.In 2012, the State of Alaska undertook a 4-year, $33 million project to provide seismic upgrades to the building as well as further restore the building to its original appearance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

          "At first it just looked like a regular government building until a tour guide mentioned that it was the state capitol and at the time they were doing some renovations. The tour guide did mention that it was in the top 50 for state capitols which was great for a laugh. I think",
          "Worth visiting. It is small, but a real Capitol in all ways. Interesting, that to gather representatives here is a problem, as the town situated on an island, so they mostly are flying from different places in Alaska.",
          "While in the city museum next door, I was delighted to hear that a tour was starting up in half an hour (self guided also available). Ed, a former journalist shared many stories from his days covering the state legislature. This added a lot, especially as a non- Alaskan. The",
          "While the exterior is an ordinary office building, the inside reflects the varied politics and elected officials over the decades. Quite a few unique photos and artwork pre- and post- 1959 statehood. The building is very welcoming, no cost, no intrusive security. Join a tour",
          "Took a self-guided tour of this place on a rainy day in AK. Glad we did. Interesting and the price is right.",
          "Easy walk from cruise ship dock. Internet not accurate when searched Capitol hours; indicated open 7 days a week, but really Monday through Friday during the summer months. So disappointed to find closed when we arrived to the building. How often does one make it to Juneau. :(",
          "Took a tour of the State Capitol Building and enjoyed the political history of the state. Nice artwork and the lawmakers chambers are small enough you can breeze through this building within 30 minutes.",
          "The building is unimpressive, a rehab of an a non-Capitol building. Of course, it is out of the way now and the Alaskan legislature doesn't do that much meeting.",
          "Although I live in Alaska I have never walked across the street to see the beautiful bronze statue of the bear and a statue and monument to Secretary of State Seward who purchased Alaska. He has a very interesting history in addition to \"Seward's Folly\", the purchase of Alaska",
          "We enjoyed a self guided tour of the Capitol building. Not only is the interior finished with beautiful wood and marble from Alaska but the walls are covered with excellent photos depicting Alaska\u2019s past.",
          "I was surprised to learn that visitors are welcome to tour the state capitol without a guide or security. There is a refreshing sense of trust. I just had to ask the security guard why the capitol is so accessible to the public. His explanation made perfect sense and you'll need",
          "Juneau is the capital of Alaska and their 1930\u2019s State Capitol Building is nothing to write home about .. like our tour guide told us, it\u2019s dome-less and as the local citizens had to purchase the land, it\u2019s on a small plot. It's also a short walk from the cruise ship.",
          "Visited the capital building in July while on a cruise. Nice architecture and accessible to the public.",
          "Worth the time . The wall photos tell an interesting stste history. I have been to many Catitol buildings now including Hawaii, Alaska & Puerto Rico (yes, I know it isn't a stste.)",
          "If you are visiting Juneau by way of a cruise ship, the State Capitol Building is an easy walk away. The building may not be as ornate as many of the state capitol buildings in the United States but it is well worth your time. When you enter you can pick up a brochure that is",
          "When arriving into Juneau, on a ship.. you are overwhelmed by diamond shops which is not why I am in Alaska.. I want to see the authentic people, places and things. I did not once see any signage for this place! I would have loved to have walked through or had a since of the",
          "Maybe a big deal to Alaskans, but I can't imagine a reason any tourist should come here. Some interesting art in the building, though.",
          "Tours of the capital building need to be signed up for in advance at the Juneau-Douglas Museum next door. We had been told when they had tours and said that a specific tour would work will with our schedule. We were not told we needed to sign up for it though. When we came at",
          "Beautiful building and landscape. Great place to go to get away from all the shops along the port. Nice location to take some pictures. Nothing grand or flashy, but very nice.",
          "We were not able to get inside, but it is still a very nice building to walk around and take some pictures when you are on a short walk from your cruise ship.",
          "To note: I did not go IN the capitol building to tour around...I can't speak to that and how the tour was. I have to say that the capitol building itself was, well, boring, compared to all the others I've been to so far. BUT, Juneau itself, the downtown, the area, I fell in",
          "I had anticipated more tourists and visitors inside the Alaska State Capitol building. There isn't much to see or do, but if you like to check off visiting the US state capitols, this is one you don't want to miss if you are in Juneau. There is a special Alaskan-styled",
          "We took several pictures from the outside and then went in and took several pictures inside. I think there is a short tour available, but when we were there no one was at the front desk so we didn't wait.",
          "Interesting to see the state capitol building in Juneau - not what we expected to find. A local store owner told us that it had recently been renovated.",
          "The most northerly capital building? Stopped off on our way to Mendenhall Glacier - right next door to the Court of Justice",
          "You may as well walk into town adn see the Capitol building. You can also see the Gopvernors Mansion and a few other statues and memorials in the area. Also some good shopping and eats.",
          "It was raining the day we landed in Juneau and made our way up to the State Capitol Building. It was quite a surprise when we viewed the building from across the street. This is not an imposing building and lacks architectural detailing and landscaped grounds. It is a very",
          "Since we were in the city on a Saturday, we only could view the outside if the capitol but enjoyed our \"bear\" picture. Knowing that there was no dome as well as the city only could be accessed by sea or air, made this a unique opportunity that we appreciated.",
          "When we visited Juneau's State Capitol you realize this 1931 building housed the territorial government. It wasn't until 1959 when Alaska became a state that the building was designated as the State Capitol. Due to Juneau being accessible only by boat or airplane I found it",
          "Not much to see here on first two floors, offices, some paintings and historical facts. No restoration. Only saw two workers.",
          "In wandering through Juneau, we looked for the State Capitol and were surprised by its exterior appearance. It is a fairly plain structure, six stories high and looks just like a typical office building. It is handsome, though, faced with limestone with a two story portico",
          "We visited one afternoon. Easy to access. We didn\u2019t do a tour. Just a brief look around if the building and outside statuary of Seward and the Brown Bear. An easy visit if you are a fan of capital buildings or state history.",
          "I'm sorry but I don't understand why other reviewers are so hung up about the actual building, surely what goes on inside is far more important than what the outside looks like. Even with a fairly minimalist pamphlet there is enough information available to give you a feel on",
          "This is a rather functional building though it seems somebody has made the effort to at least allow such a potentially prestigious building at least appear a tad more impressive by tagging on a columned front end - though it could be me being too cynical. Anyway worth a look as",
          "We just walked in and after a bit found a guy who opened up rooms and chambers for us to see; there is a self-guiding tour map. Good statue of Secretary of State William H. Seward in park across the way. Seward instigated purchase of Alaska from the Russians.",
          "Imagine a factory building from 1900, then add some columns and a pediment. That's where the pols of Alaska gather every year. It is truly uninspiring as a building. I guess they were trying to save money...",
          "This is an easy walk from the cruise ship docks, and worth a visit. We hope to visit all the US state capitols and get a flavor of the history and uniqueness of each. The speaker's 'office' is a \"must see\"!",
          "Ugly and without architectural merit. Most state capital buildings are derived for competitions or efforts to out achieve other state capitals. Someway must have skipped a page in designing this building.",
          "We took the self-guided tour of the building. The information and photos on the walls are very interesting.",
          "The building is nice to look at but the little park across the street has a bronze statue of Seward - who actually brokered the deal to buy Alaska from Russia for a meager $7.2 million dollars. Also a bronze statue of a grizzly bear eating a salmon.",
          "We had a self-guided tour. It was interesting to see the photos of the various governors. One of the most interesting moments was chatting with Joy who was just outside of the governor's office, and she gave us more insights into the culture, and the government of Alaska. It",
          "From the outside, the Alaskan Sate Capitol building is not that impressive; it looks a lot like an office complex. When one steps inside things don't change that much; not impressive. However, once one starts on the self-guided tour things change. The tour was actually quite",
          "We weren't quite sure what to expect from this tour. When you walk in the front doors there are some pamphlets that tell you about the capital, where to go and what you are seeing. It was really nice",
          "More like an office building than a state capitol. Our excursion driver said it was ranked as the 50th most beautiful capitol building in the U. S. I tend to agree. However, if you are collecting state capitol visits, this is a rare one to check off your list.",
          "I had an excursion driver who dropped me off at the steps in front of the building. There is a doorman inside with a self-guiding pamphlet for the 5 stories. They have post-it notes to do the 'stamp' which is now in my book.",
          "We didn\u2019t have time for an inside tour, but the lovely garden across the street is worth the short walk. Very cool statue of a grizzly! The sign on the door welcomes visitors to take a self guided tour.",
          "Just kidding. This attraction has plenty to recommend itself besides that. But I was curious how the local folks might highlight (of not) their famous Governor, and whether one really could see Russia from there.",
          "If you are debating between this and other things to see, I wouldn\u2019t choose this unless you are a state Capitol fan. It\u2019s neat enough to see if you are in the area with not much else going on. There are pamphlets that provide a free guide of the building. Some fun facts to",
          "This is a very workmanlike state capitol building, which fits the mindset/attitude of Alaskans. It felt more like an office building than a capitol. For that matter, it almost felt more like a county courthouse vs. a state capitol. If you want to say that you have seen a number",
          "Nice history presentation through statues in front of the lobby. Seward and the Alaska purchase, miners and a bear to pose with. It is on the way to the Juneau-Douglas City Museum.",
          "We always enjoy the opportunity to see a state's capital building and this one did not disappoint. The building is open to visitors and each of the 5 floors are full of information lining each wall. It was fun to learn the history of this newer state to our union!",
          "We were in town from a cruise ship. By the time we had finished our excursions, the Capitol building was closed for the day, so we only saw the outside. It\u2019s not as impressive as many other Capitol buildings I have visited. There is no dome or green space surrounding the",
          "Just up the hill from the main tourist area this the state capital building. Not as grand as many capital buildings, it appears more like a office building as there are no green grass grounds around it. There is no admission to enter and you can tour yourself through. People who",
          "I've been visiting the capitol buildings around the country and this was my 43rd. It doesn't have a rotunda or dome like many other state capitols, but it has some interesting artwork and exhibits. There's a small plaza outside with a new statue honoring William Seward and his",
          "Had the opportunity to visit the Alaskan capital building in Juneau and it was very interesting. It's a self guided tour with a brochure pointing out everything to see with explanations. Even got to go into their House and Senate chambers. Beautiful old heavy thick doors",
          "I have seen a few (very few) State Capitol buildings, and this one, unsurprisingly, is not one of the most impressive. But this is a small state, by population, and everything is relative. You can show yourself round for free, and the building is easy to find the town centre.",
          "A nice free activity in town. Guides are high school students. You are able to get up close and personal here.",
          "ON a stop on our cruise ship we went here. The guard was happy for us to look round. Interesting stuff all round.",
          "The Capital is another place that is just a short walk from the pier and it is literally right in the middle of town. Not much to see as it is a working office building but worth the time to swing by and see on your way to several other museums.",
          "This building is worth to visit and you will get a little brochure and can do the tour by your own. You will find some nice architecture, historic details and I have enjoyed my visit. This is one of the best things you can do in Juneau.",
          "So the Alaska State Capitol Building is not as ornate as others but it was nice. It was quiet and the legislature was not in session. There's a brochure at the front desk with a summary of the self-guided tour. Start at the 5th floor and continue down the stairs. The self",
          "This was our 49th state capitol building, and it was really nothing special. A little local art work. Had the Liberty Bell right out front.",
          "You can go to visit the capital, they offer tours or you can do your own tour with the brochure . It was very interesting and I could have taken more time if I wasn't rushed.",
          "I enjoyed this tour even more than I thought I would. Some interesting architecture, photographic history on the walls, etc. This tour is worth 45 minutes to an hour and is easy to do \"self guided\" using the brochure they hand you in the lobby/reception area.",
          "While in Juneau I walked to the State Capitol. Just a short piece from downtown Juneau. While there also walk and see the Govenors Mansion.",
          "So pretty really worth seeing. It houses the House of Representatives, The Senate Chamber and the Governors Offices.Outside is a replica of the Liberty Bell.",
          "A great Art Deco building with great collections of art and historical photos on the walls. A very useful guide is given to you at the front desk.",
          "Walked through the Alaska State Capitol building during a shore stop on our Alaskan cruise. Employees inside the Capitol were friendly and helpful with info.",
          "We didn't go inside, but it is always fun to Visit a state capital and see what pomp and circumstance is visible. The building isn't anything extravagant. Still...always interesting.",
          "Even though not really attracting, inside there are some facilities. We had a coffee, we used the toilet, we looked around to see some Alaska objects and finally going to the terrace you have a nice view of the city.",
          "We were surprised to find that the Alaska state capitol is open for the public to walk around. You can see the senators' and representatives' offices and the respective meeting chambers. Worth a visit for the curiosity.",
          "This was surprisingly approachable and educational. When you enter the building, you are offered a free self-guided tour. Follow it, you will get a great glance into Alaska's history and views of its art. The folks who work there are friendly and open. Plus they have 2 old",
          "Our family of eight including a 10, 8 and 4 year old visited the Capitol while in port on an Alaskian cruise. Everyone was friendly and pins of the state were given to the children. We were able to tour the building on our own. We met Dan Sadler, representative of one of the",
          "The capital building is open to the public and has free walking tours. It's definitely worth a visit if you have an hour free and want something convenient to do while in the area. The building is right in town and easy to access. You can get a guide from the front desk and walk",
          "Beautiful wood work, craftsmanship and art. The detail on the carved doors was amazing. I would recommend a visit here over a museum.",
          "We wanted to get a photo of one of the legislative chambers to add to our collection and I approached a staffer at his desk who promptly unlocked the door to the senate chamber for us. It was interesting see just 20 desks as Alaska has the smallest senate in the US.",
          "Juneau, this city is bigger than a state (Delaware). We walked around the city and stop by the capitol Building! Check in the spot! It's good for our daughter to visit her 3rd state building :) It's not as grand as California's state capital building and not as important as",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect but the hour we spent in the State Capital building was a good experience. There is a printed tour guide available at the front desk. You are allowed to visit 3 floors on which you'll see art depicting Alaska scenes, historical photos, a brief",
          "Small Capitol, easy to access from downtown for a self guided tour, when not in session. Enjoyed Alaskan art work and historical exhibits on every floor.",
          "I love visiting State Capitols so I jumped on the chance to visit this one when we were in Juneau for a few hours. I was happy to hear it just re-opened after a multi year renovation! Very casual place to visit - you walk in the front door, no security, and you can take a",
          "It is an easy walk around Juneau to find the interesting sites like the State Capitol and the Governor's Mansion. They aren't anything spectacular compared to many state capitols that we have visited, but still nice to show kids some history of a state.",
          "The architecture is beautiful, but like many other capitol buildings I have seen across the U.S. The staff here were very friendly and accommodating. Although this is not my kind of tour, we came as a small group and enjoyed ourselves. My friends who are into this kind of thing",
          "The Boss & I went by the place when you were up there on a cruise. From what little we could see of it. It seem to be interesting looking site. So instead we wandered around the small town of Juneau, AK. To tell you the truth I had a hell of a good time while there. The",
          "Like to take in the capitols when we're passing through different states. Really thought with all the money that Alaska has their state capitol building would be better than it was.",
          "We were just walking around town and came across this building. It was completely under scaffolding and they were replacing the facade. We didn't go in, but stood outside and watched them work on it. It will be very nice once they it get it all completed.",
          "When our cruise ship docked in Juneau, one of the things we wanted to see was the state capitol building. Juneau has a beautiful scenic setting. We walked from the dock. It was somewhat hilly but we were able to walk leisurely and observe the downtown area. We had not",
          "At least while the building is under construction, there isn't much to see other than a bunch of scaffolding. We were walking in the area so stopped by, but it's definitely not worth any extra effort. There were some nice small park/statues on nearby street corners, so we",
          "We didn't realise the building was being renovated until we were upon it. What we could see of it was interesting - I would have loved to see the new marble pillars but they were under wraps.",
          "Walked from our cruise ship down to see this building to find the streets around it closed and the whole building practically wrapped in plastic. Very small Capitol Building. I had seen it 10 years ago and wanted to revisit it. It is currently undergoing massive renovation to",
          "The state capitol building is unlike most other capitol buildings found in the lower 48. It looks more like an office building. The structure is still undergoing some repair.",
          "Saw this item in our 3A book, and it was enjoyable. Also, if you walk across the 8th floor and go out, you will be on the hill close to the Capitol and local stores.",
          "On my wife's quest to visit all 50 state capitols, we stopped by while on an inside passage cruise. The building is still under renovation and you cannot get inside to view the interior. The exterior, while not in the mold of what one typically envisions a Capitol to look like,",
          "The State Capitol Building is not really much to see right now, as part of it is under tarps being rebuilt, and it doesn't even look like much when it's NOT being re-built. I wouldn't make a special trip up to see it, even if nearby.",
          "As state capitols go, this one is really ugly. The architecture is ugly concrete, and the whole building is stained with some ugly black stuff. Just an overall ugly building.",
          "One side of the building seems to be done revealing what the rest of the building facade will look like someday. It's currently closed and not used during renovation. The City Museum across the street has a room devoted to proposals dran up and canceled over the past 50 years",
          "We were unable to go into the building due to it being renovated. It is not a fancy building and one would not know it is the capitol building unless being told or seeing the sign. Progress on its rehab seems to be going slowly.",
          "The capitol was undergoing renovation and not only could we not go in, it was completely shrouded and we couldn't see a thing.",
          "I enjoy visiting State capitals especially those built in a grand style, unfortunately the Alaskan State Capital in Juneau is undergoing a face lift and I couldn't get inside. Signs indicate construction is to be completed in Summer '16, but as you can see by my photo, that may",
          "This Alaska State Capitol building doesn't look like most other capitols (no dome, etc). it looks like a pedestrian downtown office building.",
          "A nondescript office building under construction and closed to the public when we were there. Just walk by for a bit of exercise but nothing to write about.",
          "Whether or not the building was interesting before the current construction is not relevant. Fact is that State Capitols are a great vehicle for civic pride and explaining history. Juneau and Alaska has failed it's many visitors by seemingly making no effort to to arrange for",
          "Not really much to it but administrative offices and the building itself. A small capitol for governing a small (by population) state.",
          "be warned, the front of the building is under construction. Good news, its not that far of a walk so we just burned off some of the thousand calories we'd consumed on the ship buffet. :)",
          "Interesting to see the capitol of Alaska where the Governor presides. Was not able to tour inside the structure as it was closed to visitors.",
          "Couldn't tour the Capitol building since it is presently under renovation. Except for the four large pillars outside the front building, it looks like a very nondescript office building. There is no dome.",
          "The building was being renovated when we were here, but none of us could believe this was the state capitol building for any of the states of America. Don't waste your time/money to tour unless you need a picture for a collection or a lost bet.",
          "We stopped by the Capital to take a picture and unfortunately it is completely covered by scaffolding. It was a nice walk from the cruise port.",
          "The state capitol usually offers free tours and is just a short walk from the cruise ship docks, but it is undergoing construction this summer and likely will be closed to the public. Worth having a look from the outside anyway...local granite and marble went into the",
          "During our visit, it was closed for tours. We were not able to ask questions because it appeared that the staff were on break that time; we can't find anybody. The fact that we were able to get in and took some photos was good enough for us.",
          "This beautiful Historic Capitol is located at the corner of 4th & Main Streets in downtown Juneau, directly across from the Dimond Courthouse, Juneau City Museum, and the large State Office Building. Currently 2015~2016 renovating and retrofitting the structure. There",
          "This was just \"something to see\" while we were wandering around Juneau. Inside is some historic information and small exhibits but overall, nothing too special...",
          "If I remember correctly even the tour guide said that it was rated the ugliest capitol building in US. Even if that is wrong it's not really impressive to look at. Better to enjoy some other highlights",
          "My parents, my wife, and I visited the Capitol Building on our Alaskan Cruise. I found the tour very informative and love how they allow for those all over Alaska to participate in their government. Allow at least an hour for the tour, and ask questions. The tour guides are",
          "Visited in June 2012. They have tour guides! The young lady that was our tour guide was very knowledgeable!",
          "It may not be as impressive as some other capitol buildings but I thought it was pretty. It is under construction so there were no tours. We just drove by as we were looking for parking.",
          "The building was in the process of renovations when we visited and as such could only gain access to the front foyer and lobby area. An employee gave us a brief history of the building",
          "The State Capitol Building is still under a long-term renovation project - seismic upgrades ++ You can't see much at the present time.",
          "My wife and I arrived just after nine in the morning for our self tour. When we entered the building the was a pamphlet on a desk, explaining the self tour, and you were invited to tour on your own, which we proceeded to do. We saw some of the offices, but it was obvious there",
          "Looked cool, wanted to take pictures of Alaskas Capitol and see where Sarah Palin worked lol. Was closed and under refurbishment.. Should be nice in future",
          "We were very disappointed to find the Capitol not having tours, especially after walking 6 blocks uphill in the rain! We were allowed into the lobby where there are several interesting carvings, and we saw Alaska's copy of the Liberty Bell just outside the building. So sorry",
          "In Juneau, we took a walk uphill and more uphill (there was a better route) to the State Capitol. Oh what a disappointment. It is under renovation and all that you can see is a very small lobby. On the desk is the stamp if you are doing that at State Capitols. That's it! Before",
          "The capitol is currently closed. Can take photos of the front and step into the foyer. Renovations should take two years. My sense is the capitol is very much like any administration building with some flourishes.",
          "It's not open for tours cause it's under renovation! The hours were even listed on the one page downtown map. I think it's closed for 2 years. We did get to use the bathroom.",
          "We were disappointed that we did not get to do a Capitol tour. This building is being renovated and there was very limited access. I don't know the expected completion date, but you should check before you plan to go.",
          "It is under renovation. Very limited access. It does have a small give shop. Don't expect much. It is more like a normal office building. This is our 43 capitol and it is by far the most un-impressive.",
          "Houses our State lawmakers. The Scottish Rite Temple next door was reconstructed into more office space with a sky bridge to join the two buildings. It is well done and a nice area.",
          "Currently undergoing renovation and a remodel the capitol is under construction and nothing is accessible.",
          "I like to visit state capitol buildings. This was a good stop. Small building. Good artwork. Nice folks everywhere.",
          "The State Capitol offers a lot of information about Juneau and its founding. There are Native art works and beautiful relief sculptures of Juneau's history. The building is being renovated and lacks luster at this time but is well worth visiting. The staff are friendly and",
          "Beautiful architecture. A bit different than I expected but it is a very nice building in the heart of downtown Juneau. Near the governor's mansion.",
          "The guide did an excellent job of shortening the free capitol tour to half an hour so we had enough time to walk back to the cruise ship. In that I was in elementary school when Alaska became our 49th state, I thought it was fun to hear about the details and view the art work,",
          "We walked in without checking in and did a self guided tour. It was a little strange since our statehouse (Indiana) seems to be on lockdown with guards and sign in sheets, metal detectors, etc...We just wandered around and went in chambers, and up to the Governor's office.",
          "state capitals are normally great places to visit, but this one is about like a below has been office building in a midsize town",
          "Free hourly tour if you need to get in out of the rain. The building is beautiful and the free tour includes access to many areas of the legislative chambers that are very interesting to see. Not entertaining enough for kids though.",
          "Was surprise the capital building was open for tours on Sunday. Nice tour with a very knowledgable student guide.",
          "The building may be unattractive (it was originally an office building for the Alaska Territory, never designed as a State Capitol, so no dome) but the tour is excellent. Of course, this depends on the tour guide's knowledge and enthusiasm. Our young guide, Evan Wood, was",
          "I wanted to get to downtown Juneau and just take a peak at what was going on. We had a 3 hour layover on the Alaska Maritime Highway. As it turns out, the only way to get to Juneau from the AMH terminal is via a $35 (one way) taxi ride. Bus service or other normal tourist",
          "The capitol is just a \"ugly\" former federal building, however, the real charm is on the inside. The inside tells and shows the history of Alaska's statehood. I learn and enjoyed my stop by the AK capitol.",
          "I didn't actually go into the building, so I don't know what the tour is like, if there is one. The bus driver on the way to one of our Juneau excursions said the Alaska State Capitol building was voted the ugliest capitol building in the U.S., and I don't hesitate to believe",
          "I enjoyed the knowledge of the person who gave the tour. I wish I got his name. He was very interesting and enjoyed sharing some of the stories behind the photos and surroundings in the chambers. A great tour to take for sure when in Juneau.",
          "I used to give tours at the WY Capitol so I like to check out other capitol buildings when I can. I was absolutely shocked when we found the Alaska Capital building. Sadly, besides the pillars out front there is no indication this building is anything more than a regular office",
          "Probably the most unattractive capitol in the US. Pretty sure that this was designed and built by East Germany.",
          "It was surprisingly interesting compared to what I thought it would be. The tour was nice and it was a small group. The building seems boring, but like all capitals, there was a lot of history and details.",
          "This roughly half hour tour is interesting and informative. Two of us got a personal tour immediately because we were tight on time. The building is ornate and the story about the state flag creation was worth the time alone.",
          "We were very happy that we took the time to visit the State Capitol, and take the free tour that was given by one of the very knowledgeable young guides who were there this summer. When we went we were in a small group of only three, so our guide had plenty of time to answer our",
          "A nicely done, simple tour given by a local. The legislature isn't in session much - so you're mostly getting a history lesson and a view of the building. As such, nicely done. Note: In Summer 2014 the building was under extensive renovation so there were areas we couldn't",
          "The AK Capitol building used to be a Federal office building, so it's not visually stunning and the architecture is basic and nondescript. It is nice to visit just to see the legislative offices but if you aren't an Alaska, I don't think you would care. It would just feel like",
          "It is very small and very plain compared to other State Capitol buildings. The tour was very good and it is only a short walk from the cruise ships.",
          "Those who have been to a variety of states capitals know that the state capitol building usually is large and has some sort of dome. Not so in Alaska. In 1931, the United States government constructed the Territorial and Federal Building to handle business before Alaska became",
          "The kid giving the tour was really nice, but you don't get to see a whole lot on this tour, I think it took about 20 minutes, plus the Alaska capitol is frankly kind of boring compared to other state capitols I've been too. If you have a half hour to kill out of the rain, go",
          "We veered off the tourist path and walked to the state capital. They said it was open for you to see it and they mean it! Everyone there was happy to see us and wanted to guide/direct us to whatever we wanted to see. You can wander around yourself or take a guided tour with a",
          "Nothing over the top - turned an old school into legislative offices. Nice to see some fiscal responsibility for a change! The San Fran city hall is way more overdone and much larger.",
          "I don't expect an old building coming from the 49th state, but I was disappointed in seeing a normal modern building. Their was no character in the design. If your into architecture an design of buildings this is not worth going to see.",
          "I toured the state building with a group of students and it was the most welcoming experience I've ever had with kids. The building went out of their way to not only give us a tour, but to also meet different representatives in person.",
          "Very interesting tour of the state capital. The tour guides are very knowledgeable. We worth the visit.",
          "The state capital of Alaska isn't that imposing of a building and it was having a face lift when I visited. However, it is easy to access and has some wonderful historical photos and artwork. The chambers for the state senate aren't that impressive, too new and small.",
          "We took a chance to see the State Capitol building during our Saturday visit.....surprised by it being open. We were able to either take a free guided tour or walk around on our own. We were able to visit the Chambers of the Legislature and the Hall Of Governors. We got a chance",
          "It was nice to see all the offices and stuff, and explore around the state house. There are so many artifacts and interesting things to read around the whole building.",
          "We always tour state capitol buildings when we visit capitol cities, so we made time for the statehouse in Juneau. The building is currently undergoing work on the front exterior. On a day in late July, the columns did not support anything, and work was obviously in progress.",
          "We have started visiting state capitol buildings on our trips, and we are learning a lot. Alaska has an interesting history, and our guide was very good at explaining it. The building is undergoing MAJOR renovations so we had to enter through a back or side door, but when the",
          "With the exception of marble columns in front, it looks just like an old office building, with no dome, rotunda, etc. Our guide was dynamic and gave us great information and some history of Alaska. He was a theatre major, and he had appropriate Alaska jokes and witticisms that",
          "We\u2019d recommend it. It\u2019s free and informative and especially so for anyone who remembers when Alaska became a state. The building dates to territorial days (it opened in 1931). Construction in the area, use of a side entrance and a less-than-grand appearance might cause you to",
          "We've tried to visit state capitol buildings in our travels since my nineteen year-old daughter was small and this had all the trappings and history of the state government. We stopped in as part of a self-guided walking tour through the town. Pictures of past leaders was",
          "The site was under construction so even the main entrance to the building had been moved. With the construction, do not bother to go out of your way to see this site as, like us, you won't see anything!",
          "Our bus driver mentioned that the capitol was somewhere, but didn't really point it out. Later on, back on the cruise ship, my husband found a picture of it on the internet. It doesn't look like any other capitol building, but more like an office building. Nevertheless, it",
          "Would like to see without all the construction going on around the Capitol, and to the Capitol without construction. Alaskan folks say they like simple and it is that. I just have an interest in our state Capitol buildings.",
          "There was construction outside so we did not get a good view of the building but the inside was open for visitors. We did not opt for a tour, although it was available. Enjoyed walking through the building,",
          "If you are in the area and have the time then stop and take a tour but it is not very impressive. I don't recommend that it be on your must-see list.",
          "The staff is incredibly friendly and the tour was lengthy and informative. The high level of detail in the capital building and emphasis on local and tribal artifacts is excellent. I would highly recommended adding this to the trip itinerary.",
          "If you are into government/ politics, this is an interesting tour. Coming from a state with many more residents, the small scale of the house and senate chambers was surprising. Be sure to take in the photos along the walls. Taken years ago by local photographers, some of the",
          "Very impressive, the centre of the action when the legislature is in session, the little parks close by are nice for lunch for just sitting",
          "We stopped at the State Capitol Building while in town for the day. It was raining, so it seemed like something to do indoors. There are better things to do than go here, since there is not much to see inside, but they do have a short, free tour for visitors and you are not",
          "very cozy and small tour groups so easy to hear tour guide-great historical photos-far cry from huge offices in lower 48",
          "While this is not the most elaborate capitol building, I did find it very interesting. The fact that there were no metal detectors or major security was amazing to me. I was allowed to wander through the hallways on all the floors without anyone questioning me to what I was",
          "It was raining, so we couldn't hike Mt Roberts so we did this instead. Let me say that I enjoy history and the background of things, but this place just didn't have much of any of that. It was pretty utilitarian. It was however free, so what can you really expect.",
          "We had a very informative guided tour and really enjoyed seeing the building...we were also very impressed that in Alaska, all state business is conducted over a 90 day period, Now how much of an inspiration should that be to other state and federal governments??",
          "Even though the building was nothing to write home about, the tour and the guide that we had were great. She was so nice and was very proud of her state. It was funny to hear and see the reactions of the people on the tour when we went into the 20 person Senate chamber! A bit",
          "After a morning visit to the Mendenhall Glacier, make sure to stop in at the Alaska State Capitol. Nice young tour guides will show you around - you'll be amazed how accessible the legislative offices are. Interesting that the whole state is managed from this small building.",
          "Only worth the walk up the hill if you are like me and want to tour the 50 State Capitols. As State Capitols go, this one is ranked in the bottom 5. Tour guy was upbeat and friendly, which made up for a lot.",
          "We didn't take the tour but just went inside and looked at the ground floor. All the marble is from Alaska. It's beautiful.",
          "Kind of forgettable by state capitol standards. Looks like a average size high school. The tour was short and informative though.",
          "For such a huge state geographically, the Capitol is shockingly small and understated. I did my own tour, rather than the organized one, and if you're a politics or history buff it's a pretty interesting place. The office provided a pamphlet, and you can freely browse the",
          "We were given a guide to tour us thru the 5 floors of the capital. There were 3 of us to begin with, then a foursome showed up and really slowed things down. We completed the tour by ourselves. Was not able to see the Gov's office because they were working.. Interesting pictures",
          "Juneau has a lot to offer the independent traveller and a well sign-posted walking tour will take you around all the downtown points of interest including the Capitol, City Museum & Governors Mansion. A great option if you don't want to spend a fortune on guided tours.",
          "We stopped by the Capital building and Governor\u2019s Mansion on a short walk from the downtown cruise ship area. It was quite small by California standards. Unlike California, they must operate efficiently. We also went around the corner up the street to the Governors Mansion",
          "Its free for tours, our guide was very interesting. It's a typical state house, but Alaskas past is different than most of our states. So the commentary was then different and very interesting. Its beautiful too.",
          "Someone suggested we stop here and we were very glad we made it our first stop in our walking trip through downtown Juneau. We took the tour through the Capitol and learned a great deal about Alaska politics, Juneau events and local sites. The guide did a great job and people",

          "We did not time our visit for the free tour, but roamed around the building for a few minutes. The exterior is rather bland compared to most state capitols I've seen, but I really liked the whole ambiance. There was a hilly walk from the ship to the capitol and we enjoyed",

          "The building is beautiful and the tour guide we had was knowledgeable. It is a short tour, but well worth the time to visit the State Capitol building.",
          "...the walk is beautiful. Nothing against it, and no offense intended, it's just that there's a ton of cooler things to see/do in Juneau if you have limited time off the cruise ship. If you feel, however, like you have eaten so much on your cruise ship that you feel like the",

          "Why travel all the way to Alaska to visit the State Capitol Building? Got me. For us it was because it started to rain and it looked like it would be dry inside. Fortunately, it also was pretty interesting inside. While the outside of the building isn't much to write home",
          "The guide that gave this tour was energetic and informative and made history come alive. I would definitely recommend this tour.",
          "I confess, the title for this review was literally the first that popped into my head and has nothing to do with my opinion of the place. The capitol building is actually more of a capitol campus, made up of a former federal building and other nearby historic buildings donated",

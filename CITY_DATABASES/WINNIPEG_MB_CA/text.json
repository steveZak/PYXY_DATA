        "wiki": "Assiniboine Park Zoo is an 80-acre (32 ha) zoo that was established in 1904 at the West end of Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is managed by the Assiniboine Park Conservancy and accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA).\nThe Assiniboine Park Zoo has been best known for decades for its polar bear exhibit, of which the old enclosure was replaced in 2013 with Journey to Churchill.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of Winnipeg Parks Board purchased some native animals including deer, bison, and elk to start the zoo in 1904. In 1908, the bear enclosure was built, and by 1909, the zoo had 116 animals of 19 species.In 1916, the zoo budget was $8,000 ($1,800 for food, $4,200 for labour, and $1,158 for new construction). By 1998, the animal collection had increased to include 77 different mammal species (390 animals), 151 different birds (700 specimens), and 14 reptiles (34 specimens), with the total collection including about 1,193 individuals of 271 species, and the zoo budget was $2,497,173 ($161,800 for food and supplies, and $1,952,707 for labour).The zoo got its first lion, a female, in 1935, and its first polar bear, a wild orphaned cub named Carmichael, in 1939. Carmichael got a partner in February 1940\u2014a female named Clementine.The Zoological Society of Manitoba was formed in 1956 to provide the vision and funding for the zoo. In 1957, the zoo helped develop \"Aunt Sally's Farm\", a children's petting zoo named after Sally Warnock, and which a scale model had been presented in February 1958 and opened Friday August 7, 1959. At first an admission fee of 10 cents for children over 5 and 25 cents for adults was charged. The fee was dropped years later. In 1959 the zoo was officially named Assiniboine Park Zoo.In the 1960s, the gibbon/monkey house was built, another orphan polar bear cub arrived at the zoo, and a snow leopard was added to the zoo. The Polar bear enclosure was renovated in 1967, adding an upper story, and two more orphaned cubs arrived. Then in 1968 and 1969, the Tropical House, Native Animal Exhibit, and a new south gate were added.In the 1980s, the Zoological Society of Manitoba, which had not been active for a while, began to provide money for new signage, exhibits, and infrastructure. The main entrance was reconstructed to include a new Gift Store operated by the Society of, and the Carousel Restaurant was renovated.\n\nNew enclosures for the camels, yaks, and zebras, as well as the \"Camel Oasis\" Interpretive Playground, opened in the northwest end of the zoo in 1995. This was also the first year for \"Lights of the Wild,\" featuring animal light sculptures presented by the Zoo and the Society for 3 weeks in the winter.\nIn 1997, the \"Saturn Playground\" was constructed and the main restaurant facilities were renovated. The Saturn Shuttle and Kiosk information booth projects were established in 1998, as well as an upgrade to the electrical infrastructure of the Zoo.\nIn 2001 a grant from the DeFehr foundation funded the renovation of the unused Bison Restaurant Kiosk into the Palliser Interpretive Center, the headquarters for ICE Camp. An alliance with the University of Manitoba Summer Camps initiates \"Mini U Zoo,\" where campers spend one week at the University and one week at the Zoo. The zoo master plan is unveiled to the public.\nAs late as 2000, the Zoo was open from 9 a.m. till sunset (or 9 p.m.). However by the Zoo's hours were significantly reduced. Today the Zoo closes at 4 p.m., when most people coming home from their workplace. In July 2015 the Zoo extended visiting hours every Wednesday till 8 p.m. as a trial because there were many requests from zoo visitors that the earlier closing wasn't convenient for people who work during the day.In 2004, as part of  venture with the University of Manitoba Architecture Department, substantial improvements were made to the Education Centre.\n\n\n=== Master Plan ===\nIn 2000, the Society and the Zoo started work on a new Master Plan Development Proposal (the first since 1960) for the Zoo. Initial proposals were for the redesign of the existing Polar Bear enclosure, but this eventually grew into a much larger Master Plan Development project.\nIn 2008 the Assiniboine Park Conservancy is created to develop, govern, and manage Assiniboine Park including the Zoo.\nIn June 2009, the Assiniboine Park Conservancy unveils a comprehensive $200 million redevelopment plan for Assiniboine Park & Zoo that will be completed over 10 years.\n\n\n== Exhibits and facilities ==\n\n\n=== Journey to Churchill ===\n\nIn January 2012, the International Polar Bear Conservation Centre is opened.\nIn July 2014, the Journey to Churchill Northern Species exhibit opens. The exhibit features expansive new polar bear, Arctic fox, wolf, musk ox, caribou, snowy owl, and seal habitats. As well as interactive interpretive components, a short film experience inside a 360-degree theatre, and  underwater viewing tunnels for polar bears and seals.\nThe Zoo's newest permanent area, Journey to Churchill is an exhibit representing various habitats of northern Manitoba. Churchill is home to what may be the \"world's best\" polar bear enclosure.\nIn January 2019, five year old polar bear \"Blizzard\" had died of fluid in its chest (pneumonia?).Located inside the Journey to Churchill exhibit, the Tundra Grill is a 150-seat restaurant with views of the underwater tank.\n\n\n=== Toucan Ridge ===\n\nToucan Ridge, was originally known as the Tropical House. The 1,230 m2 (13,200 sq ft) building was constructed in 1971 at a cost of $500,000 and first opened to the public in November 1972. The Tropical House would almost double the Zoo's total species and would feature birds and other animals. Temperatures inside the Tropical House would be maintained at a constant 27 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F).In 2009, the Zoo contracted with demolition company Klassen Concrete to demolish the early 1970s Tropical House. Instead of demolishing the building, a plan to reuse most of the building but to reconfigure the displays was put into place. Infrastructure renewal cost $900,000. Exhibit renewal cost $2.1 million. The project took five months to complete.On April 20, 2011, the first new exhibit as part of the Assiniboine Park Zoo's redevelopment plans, Toucan Ridge, is opened. The exhibit features animal, bird, and plant life of the new world tropics of Central and South America. Toucan Ridge is located in what used to be known as the Tropical House.\n\n\n=== Kinsmen Discovery Centre ===\nAnnounced in November 1986, and originally planned to open in the fall of 1987, the Centre broke ground in June 1988. The $1.75 million 743 m2 (8,000 sq ft) Kinsman Discovery Centre opened on March 23, 1990, two and a half years late and $550,000 over budget. It replaced the aging Aunt Sally's Farm which operated between 1959 and 1989. The Centre contains six galleries pertaining to different life forms \u2014 water, grasslands, air, underground, plus two forest galleries. A statue honouring Winnipeg the Bear (the bear that was made famous as Winnie-the-Pooh) was unveiled in 1992 and has since been relocated to the Nature Playground, in the general Park area.The Zoo's 2nd biggest indoor exhibit with fish snakes reptiles etc.\n\n\n=== Animals of Asia ===\nIn June 2010, the Pavilion of Lions is opened.  A pair of African Lions becomes the exhibits first residents.In April 2012, the Assiniboine Park Zoo becomes the only facility in North America that is home to a pair of Asiatic lions. The Asiatic Lions replace the African Lions in the Pavilion of Lions exhibit.A new 2,400 m2 (26,000 sq ft) expansion of the enclosure for Siberian tigers was constructed in 2013 and opened that same year. The new enclosure would assist the breeding program.\n\n\n=== Grasslands and Boreal Forest ===\nAfter Journey to Churchill opened in 2014 it was thought that a Wolf exhibit would be nice addition to the Zoo. Originally a wolf exhibit was not planned for. It opened in June 2018 and features four male grey wolves and one female grey wolf.\n\n\n=== McFeetors Heavy Horse Centre ===\nThe 1.9 ha (4.7 acres) McFeetors Heavy Horse Centre was announced in September 2014 and officially opened on August 28, 2015.\n\n\n=== Stingray Beach ===\nStingray Beach is a rotating exhibit that debut on the May 2019 long weekend. However after a month and a half three male specimens died from over handling by visitors and by mating related issues. Protesters wanted the exhibit shut down permanently.\n\n\n=== Seasonal Exhibits ===\n\n\n==== Shirley Richardson Butterfly Garden ====\nIn June 2009, the 200 m2 (2,200 sq ft) Shirley Richardson Butterfly Garden, located next to the Toucan Ridge exhibit, opened. The Butterfly Garden is a permanent seasonal exhibit and is closed during the Winter months.The Zoo Lights Festival is the current special event that takes place between the late fall and early winter months since (?).\n\n\n== Former exhibits ==\nA special Australian exhibit featuring koalas from the San Diego Zoo was created in 1993, and was open to the public between May 12 and September 19, in the former Aunt Sally's Farm space. This enclosure has been used for Matchie's tree kangaroos since the koalas left.\nBoo at the Zoo was started in 1996 as a Halloween event. In the first year, 40,000 people attended over a ten-day period. By its 10th anniversary in 2006, when the Pumpkin Patch Maze, Area 54 and Boo Alley were added to the attractions, the event was attended by 57,400 visitors. 'Boo at the Zoo' is no longer being offered.\nLights of the Wild, featuring animal light sculptures presented by the Zoo and the Society, was first opened in 1996 for 3 weeks in the winter. It was discontinued in 2000 and the lights were all sold to Portage Island of Lights.A temporary exhibit, Xtreme Bugs, was featured at the Zoo during the summer of 2018.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn July 2014 the wolves and polar bears had to be taken out of their display areas because one or more of the wolves dug their way into the polar bear enclosure. No one was hurt in the incident.\nSafety protocols were in question when one Amur (Siberian) tiger gained access to another enclosure and killed another tiger in September 2014.\nIn November 2014 a sea lion got trapped in a drain and died.\n\n\n== Admission fees ==\nSince its inception, the Zoo had been free. Various attempts at raising funds (beyond taxpayer funds) had been tried, including coin boxes inside the Zoo, a gift shop. By 1993 it was decided to start charging an admission fee for zoo maintenance, and upgrading/expansion of exhibit spaces.\nIn 2015, the Zoo had offered discount Tuesdays at the cost of $10 for adults. However in that year the admission fee was raised to $12 per adult.The Zoo has offered free children's admission during the days of the Christmas Break  in years 2015, (2016?), 2017, and 2018.\nAs of 2019, admission fees for visiting the Assiniboine Park Zoo are:\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe zoo hosts summer day camps for children of all ages.Guided School and Group Tours.\n\n\n== Accreditation ==\nIn September 2014, the Assiniboine Park Zoo becomes one of only five Canadian zoos to be accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nSpecies Survival Programs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Assiniboine Park Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

          "This place is amazing! I had a great time during my visit and all areas were well kept and animals looked content. It\u2019s a big place so wear something comfy and prepare yourself to get all your steps in! I visited with my family and hap a wonderful experience even though we had",

          "A few years ago, the zoo spent over $5 million dollars on its new entrance and its world class Journey to Churchill Northern wildlife exhibit. One of the most popular attractions at the zoo is Journey to Churchill where you can experience walking through a glass tunnel and be",
          "Not as fantastic as some other large zoos worldwide, however, it has a charm to it that the keepers and the reusing of old enclosures that aren't being hidden makes so much more magical. It has a worn look that's only made it better through the years.",
          "We visited here with another couple visiting from the Netherlands. Overall, the zoo still needs some work. Some areas haven\u2019t changed since my childhood 50 years ago. But the polar bear area is outstanding, especially the underwater views. This alone is worth a visit.",
          "Winnipeg's zoo is a great place to visit all year round. This winter the polar bears, snow leopards, tigers, wolves are out and about. The zoo has a polar aquarium where you can watch the bears swim overhead. The spring and summer more animals are outside. The zoo has special",
          "Lots to do. Visit zoo, have lunch at restaurant with good food at reasonable price. Lots of walking and bike trails. Conservatories very nice, tropics even in middle of winter. Worth a trip to spend a afternoon or evening",
          "This zoo has become a go to destination for citizens of Winnipeg as well as visitors. The Journey to Churchill exhibits immerse you into the animals that inhabit this part of the world. Caribou, Musk Ox, Snowly Owls, Arctic Fox, Harbour Seals and the iconic Polar Bears are",

          "Assiniboine Park Zoo is just a gem for our city. The enclosures, exhibits are stunning, staff at the restaurant are kind, and zoo staff .. very knowledgeable and helpful. A must see for all ages ...",
          "Had a business function at the Northern Experience Space. What a great way to view the Polar Bears in their aquatic habitat. I was standing right under one and was struck by the sheer size of the beast! They roiled around their pool freely. The Inuit art work and picture",
          "There at opening time. No Santa. Suppose to be there. $45.00 for 3 people where was Santa. Been great if there's at least a free coffee or Hot chocolate for people. $45.00 is over priced. Mabey I go back in 5 years when I look like Santa.",
          "It\u2019s just heartbreaking all around. The large-cat enclosures are awful. So restrictive. The tropical animals have no business being here. I just felt sad the whole time.",
          "I went with extended family and my 3 kids. Glad I brought a stroller. kids loved it. The polar bear exhibit was not up to standard. the tanks were very dirty and it was hard to see the bears, and it's the reason we went, other exhibits were good, especially the stingray one",
          "Talk about an awesome winter wonderland! It is worth the admission however, I do think that charging the same for children and adults might make it tough for some families to attend. Maybe a 10 and under rate? The night we went was pleasantly warm for this time of year so it was",
          "Hands down the best Zoo in Western \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6. Polar bear area is an excellent place to spend plenty of time. So many majestic animals to view. The ultimate place for families but awesome for a couple as well. Will be back.",
          "\u2018Tis the season and save $3 per ticket by getting your tickets at Red River Co-Op before attending the event. Once we arrived at the Zoo we had to wait outside, when the could have easily allowed us to wait in the Lobby area at the main entrance before getting to the entrance",
          "Quite a variety of animals. We love the polar bears, watching them swim from under the water tunnel is super. Monkey exhibit also fantastic as we saw a mama teaching a baby how to swing on the vines. Overall wonderful visit, definitely worth a stop driving through Winnipeg.",
          "I went to the zoo mainly for the polar bears, prior to my trip to Churchill. There are 9 polar bears, eight that were rescued orphans. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is wonderful with the polar bears having outdoor and underwater areas. Watching the polar bears swimming was",

          "We had so much fun seeing all the animals and took so many pictures. I highly suggest especially if you love animals and have small children.",
          "This is a great place for family activities. The Journey to Churchill is the star of the show. You\u2019ll love the seals and if you\u2019re lucky catching the polar bears swimming in the tunnels. Highly recommend this zoo.",
          "Despite the rain nearly all of the animals were out and about. Watching the polar bears coming over the hill and then close to the viewing window was the highlight of the zoo for us Texans. Since there were few visitors, a zoo volunteer took us around to some of the exhibits",
          "Even on a cold day I enjoyed wandering around this zoo. The Polar Bears were very active. Their enclosure in the Churchill section of the zoo was large enough to house six gorgeous bears. They were enjoying themselves. What was really cool is there is zoo restaurant, with",
          "I had the pleasure of visiting the zoo in the snow but the animals I was most interested in seeing were still quite active. The Journey to Churchill exhibit was a treat. While I ate lunch there were three polar bears up next to the glass so that was a fun experience. I did",
          "The zoo was a pleasant surprise. I had not gone for several years because of massive construction and not seeing many animals when you went. They have definitely done a massive upgrade, which is reflected in the price now, but not out of line with other zoos I have been too.",
          "We absolutely enjoyed our visit to the Assiniboine Zoo! There are an incredible variety of animals, including our favorite, the Polar Bears! We also loved the indoor playground as it was a perfect break for our 2 year old before getting some lunch at the connecting cafe. 10/10",
          "The day was cool, cloudy and misting but the visit was excellent. The Polar bears gave a very good showing, tousling and playing both in the out door display area and the inside \u201cwater tunnel\u201d Could have watched them for hours. The Amur Tigers were out and roaming and relaxing.",
          "This zoo is amazing. There is staff and volunteers everywhere to answer questions and give information on the animals. The tundra restaurant has windows so you can watch polar bears while eating. The exhibits are set up so you can actually see the animals unlike some other",
          "We spent about 2 hours because we had to go, could have easily spent more. Really well done, very friendly staff along the paths, animals are well kept. Fabulous zoo!",
          "A well layed out well maintained clean zoo. There were lots of endangered species and some I had never seen before like a trip colored squirrel. The tiger was beautiful and there was a baby monkey. They seemed very content. It was off season so there was only one place to eat",
          "Family, friends or solo...this place is fun. It\u2019s a smaller zoo which makes it comfortable to visit. I found the highlights to be the polar bears and stingrays. The polar bear loved to show off his swimming abilities...I could have watched this all day. The stingrays were social",
          "Arrived early to the zoo, and got really good views of two polar bears close up in their enclosure, another one majestically swimming over us in the glass tunnel, and a fourth rolling around outside the restaurant whilst we ate lunch! Lots of other animals including snow",
          "This zoo was a decent zoo... wasn't the best, but also not the worse I went to. The Stingray exhibit was worth a star all by itself. A few cages were empty and there were no monkeys which was a disappointment",
          "A really nice mod-sized zoo, we spent the morning walking around and were surprised to see how active all the animals were. Some of our favorites were the wolves and the polar bears. Not many people when we went so there was little crowds and you could watch the animals at your",
          "Many of the animals here are from cold climates and are very active during the winter months. The Polar Bear building and Tropical house offer great places to warm up for a little while if it is windy outside.",
          "Was a lovely way to spend a fall afternoon. Much improved. Well mapped, clean, shuttle service if needed.",
          "Presently surprised and it fantastic we will be going back as tons to do their. Its at least a half day to do it all and then some. Great way to spend time on a nice day",
          "I would go like monthly if I lived closer. Such an amazing place with many amazing things to see. I recommend this to everyone. Great for all.",
          "Must see when you are in Winnipeg. Spend the $30 to rent a scooter if you want to see everything in one day. We spent 3.5 hours there and the wife and I both had a scooter. Can't imagine how long it would of taken if we walked it. A lot of back tracking and miles of trails.",
          "First thing I must say: we did see the polar bears so that rates very high. We saw three of them; one was playing and would jump into the water on to a floating toy. The other two were laying right against the glass so we had an perfect view of how majestic they are. The zoo",
          "The zoo was a lot of fun. John and Val running the team were pleasant and informative. Had a good time at the butterfly exhibit. Stopped to have a bite after petting the sting rays. The food was good and 100% beef with no fillers. Everyone was friendly.",
          "Disappointed that there was not one bear to be seen. Obviously that is the main attraction and a big factor for the high cost to get in. The grounds are not as well maintained as they were many years ago. Won\u2019t be going again. Nothing really to attract us now after the",
          "From out of town? Plan for 4 hours. Lots of walking. It\u2019s decent and worthwhile I think but not world class. Expensive for a family, watch website for reduced admission days which sometimes include free kids admission. Parking is free. Polar bears are enjoyable if they are",
          "We enjoyed it and saw several polar bear exhibits as well as a wolf feeding. The polar bears are all rescues from Churchill.",
          "Great activity for walking and viewing animals in close to natural habitats. If walking is an issue, scooters, strollers, etc. are available for rent and there is a free tram that does loops throughout the zoo. Bob, the tram driver, was excellent and gave a very good commentary",
          "It was nice to visit the zoo for the first time again after long years. Have heard of friends and family that their experience was lousy because the bears did't show up, but when we visited the zoo, oh it was truly fun! Me and my wife enjoyed the close encounter with the bears,",
          "What a great zoo for young and old alike. The enclosures are spacious and provide excellent space for the animals as well as excellent view of the animals for the zoo patrons. Love the polar bears!",
          "We always go to this Zoo while visiting family who live in Winnipeg. It is beautifully kept. The highlight was when the polar bears were in the water above us playing. We had our lunch in the restaurant. We spent about 6 hours in the zoo. Would highly recommend a visit",
          "I think the highlight for us was the polar bears swimming around us when we walked through glass tunnel. The guide was very informative.",
          "Specificially went to see the polar bears and they did not disappoint. They swam and played in the water and there is an underground view place, so you could watch them. We had a guide and she was extremely knowledgeable.",
          "You could not ask for better. Wonderful exhibits, free parking ,reasonable adnission,lots of benches for resting and lots of bathrooms. Alot most of your day to see it all.enjoy the polar bears and the monkeys.",
          "This was our first zoo visit since our children were small. Nevertheless it was vry memorable because of the chance to get real close to a couple of rare animals. The first was a white bison. We were told it was not an albino. The other experience was with polar bears. My wife",
          "No trip to the Peg should be without a trip to the zoo. It\u2019s big enough that there\u2019s space for large animals and groups. The specialty is on North American and particularly arctic/subarctic species. The polar bear conservation exhibit is excellent and there\u2019s a swimming area",
          "As with most zoos the animals don't look happy in cramped spaces, they are seen pacing up and down, buffalos in small acreages with hardly a blade of grass. Zoos should be based on breeding programs for endangered species. I felt very sorry for the big cats in their cages and",
          "We really enjoyed the zoo. Highlights were the polar bears and the arctic fox. Lots of educational information about polar bear conservation for the children. Seals were fun too. A great family day out.",
          "Visited the Assiniboine Park Zoo this week. I was most impressed! You can be driven around the zoo like a hop on/ off bus. Visited the stingray exhibit. Very interesting creatures. Watched a feeding time. So informative! Visited the butterfly garden. So many beautifully coloured",
          "It was probably the hottest day of the year but when we visit Winnipeg, we go to the Zoo and have since it was free many years ago. Now it's almost $20 per adult, but that's where it should be. It's easy to walk around the zoo, not like the Toronto Zoo that is sooooo big! And",
          "The park is beautiful. There more than just polar bears! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Beautiful and serene place.",
          "The Assiniboine Park Zoo has become such an amazing place to view animals. My daughter and I are here at least twice a month. With the addition of the Journey to Churchill a few years back, the polar bear population has increased tenfold. Now they have the Stingray Beach which",

          "Allowed 2 hours as suggested. It was a very warm day and we found a lot of the animals we hoped to see were off somewhere cooling themselves. Understandably but disappointing for us. Had hoped to see polar bears but sadly didnt. However did pat a stingray! Plenty of areas to",
          "My daughter and I spent the morning here and were mainly interested in seeing the red pandas and the polar bears. We stopped by the red pandas first and fell head over heels in love. It was feeding time and they were just so cute. The caretaker was gentle with them but did not",
          "We lucked out and got to see two polar play flighting in water for an extended period of time... so we saw claws and teeth. We learned a ton about the species and how humans and global warming is effecting their habitat. So amazing to see Bisons too!",
          "On July 9, 2019, our whole family from Arkansas enjoyed a visit to Winnipeg and visited the Assiniboine Park Zoo to see the Polar Bears and other Northern animals. We had a relaxing fun morning and saw lots of the animals, including swimming polar bears, seals, tiger, ocelot,",
          "Yesterday we went to the Winnipeg Zoo. It was warm but we saw the most of the animals. The zoo was big and you have to walk a good distance to see all the animals. Therebis a small train that can give you a tour. The ice bear part was fun. It was huge so they can walk freely.",
          "We went on a hot summer day specifically to see the polar bears but unfortunately did not see them. We were told the best time for viewing is in February. The exhibit area is impressive and we did get to see some seals swimming. Walked around the other animal enclosures but",
          "It was super hot but still had a great time. Didn't get to see some animals as they were hiding in the shade. can't wait to go Again. Highly recommended.",

          "The zoo is a place you don\u2019t want t9 miss. We have journey to Churchill with the polar bears, there really is a lot to see and there are animals to interact with as well.",
          "When my friend wanted to go to the zoo for her birthday outing I was like great I love the newer Polar Bear exhibit and there are stingrays this year. When they said they wanted to go for 4 hours I have to admit I thought they were nuts! Well prove my sorry beep wrong.",
          "The animal compounds are very expansive. The animals seem very happy. The journey to Churchill was what drew me to this zoo. I had contemplated going to Churchill to see polar bears but this time of year is not guaranteed. Plus the expense of getting there either by plane or",
          "Although I remain somewhat uncomfortable with the whole idea of zoos, this place is both a meaningful connection to my childhood and a whole new place with so many improvements. The polar bears are breathtaking and being able to watch them swim from underneath is really worth",
          "Came down to my old stomping ground in St. James to get a milkshake and walk around the park\u2019s grounds. The sculpture garden is a must, but just sitting down by the river, strolling over the bridge and into the trees against a sunset backdrop is a true prairie wonder. Few things",
          "The polar bears swimming in their tunnel is my very favourite part of the zoo. I could stay and watch these amazing bears all day, but then we move on to other great things to see.",
          "The food was fantastic here! Saw the snow leopards, polar bears, seals and so forth. Was worth the journey.",
          "This zoo has come a long way over the years. Don't let the price deter you, as there's much to do and see here, and they are doing amazing work with the polar bear conservation. They are open year round as well!",
          "Liked the animals mostly because many were unfamiliar to me. Coming from the African safari world, gives me a different perspective. Seeing the Elk at close range was awesome and the polar bear was incredible.......the peacock though refused to show us its beauty.",
          "My love for animals goes way beyond measure and this zoo provides me with all the animals I could think of plus more. The layout is beautiful and the scenery even more so. One of the best zoos in my opinion in Canada!",

          "The animals are well taken care of here. I love the wolves, snow fox, snow panthers, and of course polar bears! You can have a very close look at the polar bears. But I think some indoor facilities need improvement, the smell is too strong for visitors, and I wonder if that\u2019s",
          "Took a notion to check out the Zoo- hadn't been there since before the construction of the polar bear facility. Had a great time, weather was cool but sunny, and the animals were out in force. We ambled around the whole facility. Really noticed how well put together that",
          "Went on a rainy day and that is probably the most animals I have ever seen in one visit, pretty much all the animals except the red foxes and lynx were out, that\u2019s a pretty good success rate. Because of the weather, very few people were there at the same time, which made it much",
          "Not a big zoo but plenty to see - we are from overseas so maybe some of the animals wouldn't be that exciting for Canadians but great for us - bison etc. The highlight was the polar bear area - we were lucky enough to have a beautiful polar bear playing with a bucket for a",
          "Went with 3 older kids and we all really enjoyed it! Prices were reasonable and food was good too! Would go again!",

          "Plan to spend an afternoon and you will not be sorry. Watching the polar bears and seals swim was worth the very reasonable price of admission.",
          "This is a good zoo for families with a good selection of animals. The polar bears and seals were interesting. Mid size park so you are not exhausted.",
          "$20.50 per person. That's what it cost to see 2 horses take a crap, a baby monkey and 5 different species of goat. If any of these things excite you, then this is the zoo for you! If you'd like to see any animals that typically aren't on a farm, this zoo has slim variety. I went",
          "We went on a cold wintry Monday and there was only 15 or so cars in the parking lot. We virtually had the zoo to ourselves. What a treat! We enjoyed seeing some of Canada's iconic animals like the Snowy Owl, the Arctic Fox, and wolves. All were easy to see, despite generous",

          "The Assisiboine Zoo has a large variety of animal exhibits. Our favourite is the Polar Bear exhibit where you can walk through a tunnel beside their swimming pond and often see a polar bear swimming close to the glass. There is also an interesting timber wolf site clise by the",
          "We decided to visit this zoo on a whim when leaving Winnipeg, and I'm so glad we did. The enclosures are well made and had a ton of room, and the animals looked so happy. Most were out as it was only around -6 degrees, and they were all playing, eating or laying in the sun. The",
          "It's February, the middle of winter in Winnipeg and we decided to visit the Assiniboine Park Conservatory (primary to view the seven Polar Bears). We were surprised how many interesting animals where on display weathering the elements as well. Camels, a Bengal Tiger, eagle,",
          "A great way to spend the day with the family or a friend.The zoo has many attractions and exhibits from butterflies to buffalo and is always upgrading its facilities. Family pass is the best value for the dollar and especially with little ones up to teens.",
          "We spent the day at the zoo on a very cold day. When we arrived at the polar bear exhibit, we didn\u2019t want to leave. It\u2019s worth the price of admission.",
          "We didn't get a reserved area as they were all booked. Had lots of fun. I'll admit the new entrance still throws off my orientation when I'm in there. The kids really enjoyed the butterflies",
          "This zoo is all about 1 thing....the Polar bears. They have a massive enclosure for the bears to roam around. You are able to see them in the underwater viewing tunnel and if you are lucky you will see several bears swimming, fighting, and enjoying their time in the water",
          "The zoo is a wonderful place to bring your family. I loved when they had the dinosaur exhibit. ( this last year was giant bugs ~ I liked dinosaurs better ) I found the zoo to be very clean and well managed. the animals looked healthy. I especially love the newest edition to the",
          "I specifically went to the Assiniboine Zoo to see the exhibit entitled: Journey to Churchill. Churchill, in Manitoba, is where the polar bears and beluga whales come in Hudson\u2019s Bay, Canada. It is a very expensive trip up to Churchill, Manitoba and I was hoping this zoo",
          "We went there with family, it's so much fun. You get to see polar bears, underwater aquarium and so may animald. But the food part was a little disappointing as we could only get chips and nachos and that too for 3 times the original price. Could have been better. But Overall",
          "We have twin 13 year olds, a 10 year old, and a 3 year old. We have bought a family membership now for two years and it is totally worth it! Even when we are short on funds, it's nice to just go hang out on a kid date because of the membership. Well worth it.",
          "The polar bears were active and looked very content in their habitat. We were able to see them from inside the Churchill coffee shop as well as from outside. The cub conservation area was lovely. Three volunteers stopped us to talk so that they could recommend which animals",
          "Went there with wife and daughter. The biggest attraction here is the polar bear exhibit. It is very well built and seeing polar bears in real is amazing. We even got to see them swim over us (we were in underground tunnel with glass above us). Unfortunately lions were sleeping",
          "I\u2019d grown up going to the zoo and although it was enjoyable, often the animals were lazy and sleeping trying to escape the summer heat.

So believe me when I say Assiniboine Zoo\u2019s polar bear exhibit is one of the best bear exhibit I\u2019ve seen and it totally worth the price of admission.

          "While we were surprised at the cost of admission ($35.50) for 2 of us, we enjoyed the layout of the zoo and the variety of animals. It was mid-week in September, and the tram wasn't running, so if the tram is important to you, check ahead. Also the ice cream shop was closed, but",

          "This Park has a wide variety of wild animals. Giraffes, polar bears, black bears monkeys, various wild bird species, etc.",
          "Great place to take the family especially kids. Friendly staff and great map. Be prepared to walk although you can take the complimentary trolley bus. You just have to wait for it. The polar bears and tigers were the highlight. But remember most animals sleep during the day so",
          "This is a great zoo to see the animals. Each exhibit is clean and the animals seem well looked after. There were very few animals we were unable to see because of the design of the enclosures. The layout of the zoo is very easy to follow and see all the animals.",

          "Family & child friendly. The staff are knowledgeable of the animals there. It was very welcoming. It\u2019s recommended to go early to find a good parking spot. I think \ud83e\udd14 it should be priced under $20, though.",

          "We took our friends from the UK to see the polar bear at the zoo. The compound that the polar bear are housed is quite an amazing and natural environment. They delighted everyone with constant antics and we all came away stunned by their beauty! However, as we continued to",
          "We hadn't been here since 2010 so we thought we would come see the new exhibits. The polar bears were really cool to watch swimming around over top of you in the glass enclosure. Seals were neat too. Enjoyed watching the polar bears out the window of the restaurant while we ate",
          "Visited with my husband and two year old daughter... we loved the Polar bear area where they also had a short film in the theatre which was interesting enough to keep our toddler entertained. Lovely zoo to walk and explore... horse cart rides too which we didn't do as our",

I\u2019d say that things look better and the new attractions are cool BUT....still have a tough time finding my way around, unsure if I saw everything or if I missed something cause there isn\u2019t a whole lot of direction.",
          "What a perfect visit to the zoo. So nice to see the pens are large and designed so visitors can view the animals without fences in most areas blocking the views. The Polar Bear area was huge and so like the bears proper habitat. Be sure to visit the Butterfly enclosure that is",

          "I haven\u2019t been to the zoo in many years! It is bigger and better than ever. Love the new polar bear exhibit! The new bugs part sucks - they are animatronics - not actual live bugs. I appreciated drink vending machines located throughout the park. It was hot out today!! This",
          "This is my second time here (1st time 2 years ago) and it was just as enjoyable. There were new polar bears swimming but just as active and cute. It was a hot day so while lots of the animals were hiding or just sleeping the bears kept everyone entertained. The butterfly area",
          "This was one of our reasons for visiting Winnipeg and we were not disappointed. So many animals to see and very clean. The map was helpful, but I would recommend a lot more signage to help people navigate this very large zoo. The polar bear exhibit was incredible. It alone was",

Now it\u2019s $20 (kids are less) and I actually felt like I got my money\u2019s worth. The polar bears alone are worth it. Very cool. No pun intended. Overall I was really",

          "Great zoo - lots of different animals. Loved how spacious the enclosures seemed for the animals (especially compared to some other zoos). Easy to see the animals as most enclosures went 360 degrees around. The polar bears and meerkats were a hit! Thanks to the volunteers who",
          "This is a spacious place for visitors and the permanent residents! We were impressed by the amount of space most (but not all, e.g. the charming red pandas) of the animals were given. The high point was observing a polar bear swimming. You can observe every movement through",
          "This is the highlight of the Assiniboine Park Zoo. Seven years ago when we first visited the zoo there\u2019s only 1 lonely polar bear in the inclusion. This time we\u2019ve seen 6! Amazing!!! We were kind of disappointed at first when the one and only polar bear looking into the tunnel",

          "The new zoo is way better than the old boring hoofed animal collection but is still not worth the high price. There should be a couple if days a week with cheap or free admission for kids. $60 for a family of 4 is just too much. Making it affordable will increase revenue with",

          "I\u2019ve been to quite a few zoos and this one is the least favorite. I felt bad for the polar bears: they looked so parched, in the sun during a hot day. There was geese poop everywhere you walk - I know they can\u2019t help that, but I wish they had a way to clean it up. Don\u2019t wear",

          "The zoo is changed a great deal since I first visited it over 40 years ago. The most exciting aspect of this zoo is the Polar Bear exhibit. Not to be missed. All the many other exhibits are in mostly great shape and a visit to the Winnipeg Zoo was highly recommended.",
          "Disappointing . Polar bears (2 seen) were letharhic . No brown bears . Wolf enclosure being rebuilt. Only a few small monkeys, few birds.. there were a few wild cats and various cattle . did not see any penguins . Basically not worth the trip. Did not seem much to hold",

          "I am quite fond of the Winnipeg Zoo. A large portion of the zoo has been updated in recent years which adds modern architecture to the visual appeal. Some unique attractions of our zoo is the journey to Churchill exhibit as well as the butterfly garden. The peacocks are also",
          "We went with a large group and certainly were not disappointed. Lots of animals in wonderful settings. The polar bears were the best! You can watch them swim. It's amazing! Even a hit with our 2 teenage boys!",
          "Great day. My wife and I took the backstage tour with my step sister, her husband and two children. It was fantastic. The best part was the tour of the lab. My eight year old nephew said after that he wants to work in the lab at the Zoo. Great day for polar bears too. Three",
          "Being a local, I had been at the zoo many many times when my children were young. As they grew older, my visits to the zoo declined. I was very happy to learn of all the wonderful additions and renovations over the past few years and had every intention of visiting, but I never",
          "Beautiful zoo with lots to see. It was a very hot afternoon when we were there, so many animals were not very active. We were disappointed that we didn't see any of the polar bears or cubs. You can easily spend three hours or more here.",
          "We visit this zoo every time we go to Winnipeg.Its so pleasant walking round and especially enjoy watching the polar bears and seals swimming",

          "The zoo is just amazing. The Journey to Churchill is very informative and it is such a thrill to see the polar bears and seals swimming overhead. Loved the Amir tigers - did not know that these beautiful creatures loved water. It was so neat to see them swimming in their",
          "We spent the day at the zoo exploring. There was so much to see and do. The journey to Churchill exhibit is excellent. We had lunch at the Tundra Grill and were able to watch the polar bears wandering around outside. The dinosaur display was really well done too! The zoo is",
          "Really nice zoo with a wide variety of animals to view. Some of the animals the kids most wanted to see (arctic fox and red fox) were either not in their area or were hiding. Many animals we had not seen in U.S. zoos were very visible and cool to watch - moose, muskox, snowy",
          "It has been a few years since we have been to the zoo and it has changed alot. We loved all the new exhibts.",
          "This is a smaller zoo with a big polar bear exhibit! They are not to be missed and best if you can time your visit with ranger discussions. They explain a deal about the rescue operation at the zoo and details about the current polar bear residents that they rehabilitate. Fun",
          "I loved this zoo. It was very nicely shadded with trees and you could get close to the animals making it easy to see them. With small children I think these 2 things are a must. It is the perfect size for a family visit and there are plenty of places to rest and get food it you",

          "Had a great trip to zoo today. Even though it was busy there was lots to see and do without being stuck in crowds. The polar bear exhibit was very crowded but that's to be expected. The bears are fascinating to watch in the glass tunnel! We really also enjoyed the walking with",
          "Spent about 3 hours enjoying the Park. Snow leopards and Polar Bears were Fabulous! Dinosaurs Alive was fun for the kids but life size for us. Couple of good gift shops and lots of watering stations. Not the Best Zoo but OK!",

          "This zoo is a smaller zoo compared to some large city ones. That being said it was probably the best zoo I have been to! All the exhibits are clean and very well maintained. The new polar bear and seal enclosures are beautiful. The seals will swim right over you and check you",
          "This is the second time I have visited this Zoo and they have improved it even more! I loved the polar bears especially how you can watch them from inside the cafe! The walkway tunnel is brilliant! The bears actually swim right over you!",
          "This is the first time we have been back to the Zoo since the polar bear enclosure has been completed and wow what a difference it makes to the whole Zoo. I would recommend this to anyone. I have two complaints however as the prices they charge for food is ridiculous as you",
          "This zoo has done a fantastic job of showcasing its care for orphaned polar bear cubs as well as Churchill, Manitoba, the region where many come from. These rescued bears are ambassadors to educate us about the importance of taking care of our planet. For those who cannot",
          "Visited the park specifically to see the Journey to Churchill exhibit-- it was fantastic! The polar bears swimming in the tunnel are simply amazing and worth the price of admission. This exhibit alone is on par with other well-known zoos (like San Diego) but has its own unique",
          "All i have to say is that i wished that my son was here with me i, don't think we would have left the park before the day had ended. There was so much to see with the selection and verity of animals that where on site it was hard for me to leave when it was time to go. But the",
          "The Journey to Churchill exhibit is nice but if you want to see anything other than polar bears, you'll be disappointed. This zoo doesn't even have giraffes or lions and most of the exhibits are overgrown weeds with no animals in them. Defiantly not worth the $20 admission fee.",
          "It's been a year since we've been here, and it's as great as ever. The zoo staff and volunteers are friendly and helpful, and you can see they work very hard to take top care of these animals. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is the star of course, but to see a white bison is",
          "We loved our morning at the zoo. While the variety of animals is somewhat limited compared to larger zoos the exhibits are really well done. We got to see the tigers, snow leopards, seals and polar bears from a couple feet away. The animals were pretty active which made the",
          "A tad pricy but enjoyable. The highlight of course was the Polar bear exhibit. The butterfly house had only 2 butterflies in it.. No idea why it was like that. Make sure you go to the swan pond and visit the birds there. Many of them are birds that have been injured and cannot",
          "It had been several years since going to the zoo as I now live in BC. They have really spent some money and added several new attractions. Laid out nicely where all attractions just combine together. Polar bear and seal house were are favorite. Nice way to spend a couple hours.",
          "Went to see the zoo after several decades. The polar bear swimming tank is impressive, and you walk through a glass tunnel and they swim around you. The wolves were also gorgeous. A rare white bison is an impressive member of the local herd. Many of the habitats are very kind to",
          "Just hope that the animals are actually visible when paying for such an expensive ticket. Cute gift shop.",
          "The entire zoo is well laid out, the animals appear to be well cared for and many of the enclosures are of a good size. The polar bear exhibit is particularly fantastic, I could have spent an hour there watching them dive in the water. Great single and double strollers available",
          "Lots to see and do at this zoo, which is undergoing a programme of improvement in conditions for its animals. There is a cafe with fries etc, but some healthy options too. Lots of polar bears and other northern animals.",
          "Not the best Zoo I've seen. The Polar Bears could not be seen on the day I went to the Zoo. It was very disappointing. It wasn't cheap either. It was a bit of a disappointment to be honest. The monkey cages were nothing like they used to be. There were very few monkeys -",
          "Easy to either walk or take the tram around the grounds to see the animals and attractions. Great photo opportunities and the Road to Churchill, Polar Bear attraction itself made the visit worth while. The only disappointment for us was the the butterfly conservatory was out",
          "We are regulars at the zoo! It is 100% worth the membership! We pack snacks and get lunch at the restaurant (really well priced). I have 2 kids under 2. Parking is always good, I find the best part of the zoo is the staff. They are always directing u to something exciting",
          "This was a gramma & grandpa with a 6-year-old grandson visit! We all loved the polar bears and all the other animals, but his real favourite was the helicopter that he got to climb into and pretend to fly. Gramps and I thought the dinosaurs were pretty cool, but grandson was too",
          "The zoo get better and better and is well worth a visit when in Winnipeg. We particularly like the polar bear exhibit and it is in a fabulous enclosure, it is a treat to be able to walk under the bears while they are swimming. If you visit the zoo this summer they have an",
          "I loved to see the polar bears! and the snow owls! Great place to go with children if visiting Winnipeg",
          "I would give the zoo an excellent rating if it was based only on the Gateway to the Arctic exhibit. But the remainder of the zoo is barely average, bordering on poor. The zoo tram covers a very limited area so keep this in mind if you have mobility problems. There is quite a",
          "The Winnipeg Zoo has recently received many updgrades. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is truely unique to Manitoba and as a tourist in the town, it is a must see! $20 to get in for an adult is cheaper than most zoo's i have visited however, the quality of this zoo lives up to",
          "A zoo is a zoo, right? Well, it looks like Assiniboine Park Zoo is doing their best to differentiate themselves from the that old school of thought. Granted, there are still some of the traditional exhibit styles for some of the animals, but APC has made some fantastic upgrades",
          "I've been to this zoo many times, and loved it a ton throughout the years. I was in town for the past couple weeks, but haven't been to the zoo in maybe 7 years (I'm a Science PhD Candidate). That being said, the whole museum has dramatically changed in that time, so I thought",

          "My father wanted to view the polar bears and so we attended the Assiniboine Park Zoo today. We viewed both the older polar bear exhibit and the cubs exhibit. The young cubs were very active. There is a wide variety of exhibits throughout the zoo. We were most impressed with the",

          "A chance to see rescued polar bears and cubs, wolves, elks, bison and more in semi-liberty.Raising awareness on climate change restricting wild life habitat. Allow plenty of time to do it justice, great for adults and children alike.",
          "A little pricey for portions being closed off. Beautiful day and a beautiful walk. Many helpful and knowledgeable staff on hand for queries and information. The zoo is unfortunately (for us) undergoing a lot of work - a good thing for the future - but left a lot to be desired",
          "Had heard much about the zoo and its Journey to Churchill exhibit. Sadly, a lot of that was closed. Some of the animals (like the snow leopard) were in tiny enclosures. We were there on a rainy day in May, so it was very quiet.",
          "We went with our grandchildren, ages 3 and 6 and enjoyed absolutely everything there. Saw the polar bears and seals...what an awesome place. To be able to experience their underwater habitat is unreal! Had a picnic, saw the snow leopards, cougar, wolves...hadn't been to the zoo",
          "Was just there today with out of town visitors. The polar bear display is wonderful - watched 2 cubs frolic and play in the water from the underground viewing chamber. I know we aren't supposed to support zoos ... and I agree totally with ones where animals are kept in bad",

          "A beautiful day and walk in late April. Missed the polar bears, not sure where they were. It was hot and maybe they were concealed in the shade somewhere.",
          "This is a perfect attraction for children, and a nice one for adults too. Everything is well organised and the staff are eager to help. In fact, they set up mobile interpretation kiosks here and there to provide more detailed information about the exhibits, which you don't often",
          "The polar bears and seals are awesome. They have really good environments to watch them in and you can go under the glass tank and see them swimming around. The butterflies are totally cool too. Last summer my son and I saw a butterfly hatch from its pupa and it was awesome.",
          "My second visit in the last 18 months and more disappointing than the first. $20? Seriously? They got rid of a lot of animals and overspent on a massive polar bear exhibit. Biggest problem this week was no bears! They were doing cleaning and maintenance on two key viewing",

          "This was a surprising visit - we had read some less than stellar reviews so we had concerns before going - especially with it being mid-April and the slower season. We did end up going on a Wednesday - it was around +14C so not too hot or cold. The admission fee is very",

          "It was a lovely Spring day to walk around the zoo at a leisurely pace. On a previous visit, we were disappointed that the polar bears were lazing in the sun, no interest in swimming, which provides us such a close-up view of them. However, on this visit, they were very actively",

          "Went during colder time. It was 40-47 degrees so not all exhibits were open yet so we paid for a hat exhibit sorta. But we knew that going in. Kinda wish they would lower prices for not a full exhibit. We did love the underwater walkway for polar bears and seals!!! Great",
          "We love bringing visitors to this restaurant at the park. The food is consistant, very large portion and excellent sweet potato fries for the price. Love the outdoor patio also.",
          "Came here in June 2016 and enjoyed what I saw of it. The animals were neat to see and it was not too hard to find. My only complaint is that it was a little smaller than I expected. The polar bears and Welcome to Churchill area was very well done though.",
          "Went there with the kids and we love everything, the kids learned so much about every animal they saw",
          "It's sad to see the animals in the cages and in the summer they hide from the heat so you see what ever animals that decide to show their face. The polar bears are in a large habitat but they prefer the water. The water tunnel is nice to see the polar bears dive and then you can",
          "We had so much fun at the zoo. It was a colder day so we went early and there were very few people. We got to see the polar bears swimming in the tunnel which was a definite highlight of the trip. We got to talk to a zookeeper about the horses and eat lunch with a view of the",

          "The Churchill Exhibit makes the rather costly entrance fee worth it. The animal's habitats are worthy of praise as they mimic the natural habitat plus provide the proper space for each species. The rest of the zoo is old and in need of a face lift and the big cat exhibits are",
          "We went with great expectations of seeing monkeys at the zoo but none were to be found. It seems to afford the polar bear exhibit a lot of other animal attractions were closed. Such a shame. Will not go back again",

          "This is my favourite place in Winnipeg. My kids and I rode Sophie the elephant when they were little, watched squirrels steal peanuts out of a man's pants' pocket, and visited the cage of a tiger that had nipped off a curious man's finger. And for a real treat we spent hours",

          "In October we decided to visit the Winnipeg zoo as we hadn't been for several years. Our first discovery was that the entrance had changed so we had to drive to the proper place. The entrance was very modern and inviting. It also encloses the gift shop which was zoo oriented and",

          "We went there with our grandson from Japan. The much touted polar bear exhibit was empty. They were in the old grisly bear cage. The petting zoo was closed. It was definitely not worth the $20.00 per person. There was no staff around to ask for direction. The map was useless",

          "Unfortunately the money in this zoo seems to be focussed on new things rather than keeping the enclosures full. At one point we walked past 5 empty enclosures in a row. Lots closed down. As far as I was concerned I paid high admission just to see the polar bear exhibit!",
          "We loved the Arctic exhibits with the wolves, polar bears, and seals. Even around mid-day the tigers were playing and splashing around in their pool. The artificial dinosaur walk through was even educational for an adult to go through.",

          "The Zoo has improved from a C- to an A over the past couple of years. The polar bear section is outstanding as are several others. Several millions have been invested in improving the Zoo and it shows. Winnipeggers should be very proud of their Zoo as it is now world class.",
          "Not too big nor too small the copious exhibits display animals from every continent as most big zoos offer; no surprise there. What is unique is the polar bear and seal areas. This exhibit is a poor man's trip to famous Churchill MB where the bears come thru town every",

          "The zoo has evolved over the last few years to become a world class animal sanctuary and interpretive centre. The Journey to Churchill with the polar bear exhibit is educational and a lot of fun.Just watching the bears in the tank through the glass tunnel is a blast! The new",
          "There is so much more than the Polar Bears, but, they alone are worth the price of admission. They are most active first thing in the morning. There is also the Heavy Horses, snow leopards. Give yourself a few hours, the restaurant by the polar bears is reasonable.",

          "This was my first visit to a zoo in many years and I think it was a good choice. Although we knew it was best to get there early in the morning for seeing the polar bears when they would be most active, it was just before 1pm when we arrived... just in time for the two bears",
          "In November 2015 I went to Churchill to see the polar bears live so this time in Winnipeg I wanted to visit the zoo to see them. Especially as 2 of them were from Churchill. We were very lucky as we actually saw the bears playing in the pool and had a great time watching them",

          "Great place for the family year round...the village lights during the winter was epic!!",
          "The upgrades to the exhibits and to the zoo itself are great. It's been years since I had the chance to go again and I thoroughly enjoyed it with the family.",
          "Amazing, keep in mind it is Winter so dress warm, my fav's...Stingray Beach, Tundra Grill (saw the polar bears at play), & Gateway to the Arctic...",
          "Been members for a couple of years for the whole family. Highly recommended. It's a great place to bring kids for a nice walk. Staff and volunteers are always courteous. Food is pretty good. Went to visit the new stingray exhibit, early preview for members and it was pretty cool. My kids always enjoy going.",
          "Definitely need to check out the Christmas lights at the zoo. Such a great experience for our kids!",
          "Best zoo in Canada. Went here as a kid with school trips. As i remember. Will return come spring/summer. Great experience for kids and adults alike!",
          "we were here for Brew at the zoo, the outdoor beer festival. It was a fantastic evening, with a lot of great beer vendors and liquor vendors sampling things. This is the third year we've gone, and we always enjoy ourselves.",
          "Always love going here. They always do something so it's not the same old same old.",
          "Amazing place to go as a family, especially with kids. The tickets look expensive, but are totally worth it. There are a lot of bathrooms, free water fountains to refill your mug and various places with picnic tables to enjoy you're snack\\lunch.\nThe 360 theater experience is awesome too!",
          "A beautiful place for a stroll.",
          "Went to zoolights on last night  \nIt was nice out which made it easier to walk through all the lights . I thought it was well done",
          "The lights are spectacular. Great value at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.",
          "I didn't like it, it was a rip off!! I've been to other places way better than that; Not worth to visit!!",
          "A great little zoo for all ages. The polar bear exhibit is the highlight of the park, we were able to see them play fighting over the water tunnel. Butterfly exhbit was neat and informative. Plan on a minimum of 3.5hrs, though you can easily spend more. Bring a picnic lunch and spend some extra time in the park next door.",
          "Love it! The polar bears and stingrays exhibits are both awesome. The zoo is spread out nicely so it didn't feel crowded even with a full parking lot. Great assortment of animals for the size of the zoo and the price of admission. Will definitely return!",
          "Great Zoo. Restaurant with the viewing windows of the polar bear was spectacular.  All of the volunteers and Keepers were very friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "Great place to bring the family! Our younger girls really enjoyed it. Such a variety of animals. Many buildings to enjoy displays and animals in. I am very impressed at the amount of volunteers helping run the zoo! Way to go Winnipeg!",
          "Always a fun time! Lots to see and always different events going on as well.",
          "The park is big. We are so happy to have a great family day here",
          "Unfortunately my photos and videos were accidentally deleted. A particular member of staff was so helpful and went that extra mile - I had spoken to her about the polar bears not being visible in the tunnel area and she explained and guided \u2026",
          "Nice Zoo. Very friendly staff/volunteers. The stingray house was the hit only topped by the polar bears. Saw them swimming in that water tunnel... Just great",
          "Beautiful park and nice trails to walk your dog.",
          "Beautiful place. Wish they had more space. Beautiful Animals \u2764",
          "Polar bears,  oh my!  And a lot of other cool stuff, nice people. Hot soup, too.",
          "So glad we were able to see the Christmas lights so much fun",
          "Not a very big or diverse zoo.  It's got some interesting exhibits, but you can see the whole thing in a couple hours.  I'm sure it's good for such a rural area, but not quite up to my expectations.  It would be nice if they had a more variety of animals.  Also, the peacocks got annoying as they are everywhere.",
          "Great place to learn about animals and help support captive breeding programs. This season they have the stingray beach where you can touch them! If you go often enough and ask questions, you can get to know the animals' stories. Well worth a membership if you plan to do 3x/year.",
          "Great place for all ages! With informative and friendly staff and volunteers. Lots of different animals and lots of information about each. \n\nThe layout is a bit confusing, but there are several big maps, and a lot of volunteers ready to help you find your way",
          "Beautiful zoo, well maintained and reasonably priced for entry. Unfortunately the day we visited it was quite hot out so we weren't really able to see the polar bears which are the zoos main exhibit. It would be nice to have more viewing options for days like this.",
          "Absolutely superb place!! This is one of the best places to visit if you are in Winnipeg (in addtion to the Forks and the Human Rights Museum). \n\nThe park is well kept and has several area for kids activities,walks, music arena, Arctic \u2026",
          "Fantastic zoo,  and is huge.   I  just love it.",
          "Beautiful park, lots of green space and nice place to spend a few hours. Zoo is somewhat uninspiring, but still nice for kids.",
          "The Assiniboine Park Zoo is an easily accessible educational and fun outing for our family. Paths and buildings are easy to move around in, changing exhibits and educational talks by zookeeper's keep the experience fresh. The new sting ray \u2026",
          "Went for Zoo Lights Festival. So beautiful and great to see so many families out.",
          "Zoo Lights was amazing fun with Catfish Brass Band and samples from local microbreweries...well done! A Winter Activity!!!",
          "Light at the Zoo was amazing! Lots of friendly staff assisting you along the way.",
          "I am rating it as 3 stars because they claim the zoo is open winter and summer. I went during winter and, unfortunately, I didn't fully experienced the visit. The \"warm zones\" are sometimes too spread out in the zoo and some are really \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with family, tons of animals and most of the time they are awake and super friendly staff :)",
          "Zoo is a great place to have fun and to enjoy the nature.",
          "Large enclosures and well maintained. The polar bear exhibits were stunning and the tunnels under the water were a good show. The seals beside the polar bears is an odd placement as the polar bear swam and waited by the glass to \"attack\" the seals.",
          "The Winnipeg Zoo is always a great place to spend the day at. Went to the new rotating exhibit which currently has the stingray exhibit, and it was a fantastic exhibit for the kids and adults. Would definitely visit again but would pay the \u2026",
          "Outside of the Journey to Churchill exhibit, there isn't that much else at the zoo that stands out from other facilities.\n\nThe stingray exhibit was different, but prepare to deal with crowds and a lot of pushy people with their kids. \u2026",
          "Very friendly people. Nice cleaned up and free ways all around the zoo.",
          "Lots of fun with polar bear, a short movie, white birds in summer and at winter light festival...",
          "I took my grandson to his first zoo camp. It was a tremendous experience for him and he had so much fun. The teacher and volunteers were great. Would highly recommend it",
          "Cool but a smaller zoo. The polar bear exhibit was really cool. The albino bison was delightful to see.",
          "lights at the zoo was great. wish they had more warming huts.",
          "Zoo lights festival was great! Loved all the displays.",
          "My family enjoyed the zoo. Nice layout and amazing exhibits.",
          "It was nice seeing real polar bears and a tunnel aquarium with seals in them, my kids loved it.",
          "They've done such a great job with all of the renovations. Very modern exhibits in which makes you feel like you're walking through nature and not in a zoo. Glad to see great work is being put in!",
          "Zoo lights were fantastic! Lots to see and do, music, drinks, photo ops, a blacksmith, horses, 'Axe throwing'... 10/10!",
          "Super nice day date. Plenty of different animals to enjoy and the new polar bear area is a must see!",
          "Zoo lights offers over one million lights.  Lots of areas to keep warm.",
          "Lots of action at the zoo today. The Cougars were playing, the polar bears were wrestling and the snow leopard was being trained while we were there.",
          "An excellent wildlife park. Well laid out. Animals well cared for with large enclosures. Polar Bear was a Huge hit. Well worth the visit!",
          "Awesome time lots to see and do first time going in the winter",
          "The Journey to Churchill exhibit makes this zoo a  world-class facility. The conservation and animal protection programs along with the polar bear rescue program are reasons I support the zoo as a member. Big bonus: you can see the whole zoo in a day and still have time to visit other areas of Assiniboine Park.",
          "Went for a dinner. Nice location. Walked around and saw the Kangaroo,the peacock and some other animals. The highlight was of course the Polar Beer playing with a ball. Staff and service was great.",
          "Nice experience. The light display was beautiful.",
          "You may see some animals if your lucky!",
          "Was a good way to burn a morning. The stingray experience was awesome. Went during a bunch of prep for inspection so some of the exhibits we're closed , which was a bummer. Overall would recommend!",
          "New exhibits are open lots of fun with children exploring the polar bears interesting to see them interact with each other we even got to see a fight",
          "Best zoo I've ever been to! Unlike other zoos where you're often straining to find the animals way off in the distance, here you are up close and personal. Our whole family  had a blast!",
          "Amazing place. Love being able to go with my grandson.",
          "As good as their service to humans is, their care for the animals is even better.",
          "I love our new Zoo. The Journey to Churchill and the Stingray exhibit are excellent! I go a few times a year usually once a season!",
          "The 'new' zoo is much improved. The focus is on northern animals (although not exclusively) and the jewel is the \"Voyage to Churchill\". This is the polar bear and seal environment that is exceptional. The zoo currently has 9 polar bears, \u2026",
          "The Zoo Lights festival is a magical experience, just remember to dress warmly!",
          "Came down to my old stomping ground in St. James to get a milkshake and walk around the park\u2019s grounds. The sculpture garden is a must, but just sitting down by the river, strolling over the bridge and into the trees against a sunset \u2026",
          "Assiniboine Park has lots to offer.. we buy passes for our grandkids and parents every year..  The gift shop is reasonably priced with items rarely found elsewhere.. Customer Service in every area of the Park is second to none .. friendly, knowledgeable, efficient.. The Basic package is worth every cent.. A year's worth of enjoyment..",
          "The peacocks were running around, which was neat. Toucan Ridge also had birds loose. Very enjoyable. Food is great.",
          "The zoo has made a lot of improvements but the price has increased in the past couple years. Churchill exhibit is nice as is the upgraded tiger area.",
          "Grandkids loved. Weather was fantastic",
          "Loved it. Journey to church hill was amazing. The red pandas and the hibnions.All the animals are wonderful. We at at the tundra grill while watching the polar bears. The hydration refill spots for water bottles is awesome.Love the zoo. Saw \u2026",
          "So I was at the zoo on August 7th, it was a pretty hot day like abut 30 degrees, we were there in the afternoon around 2, was very disappointed that no animals were out.  Why does the zoo close so early?  If they stayed open in the evening \u2026",
          "The new stingray exhibit is awesome! Being able to get up close and actually touch the animals is a neat experience.",
          "The polar bears are fantastic! And while I can't judge the financial situation of the park, a lot of compounds and habitats are in serious need of expansion and upgrades. Could also do with more interactive expos to engage the kids in a \u2026",
          "People can enjoy the Zoo year round taking a stroll through the many paths. Watch the many animals, the polar bears entertaining playing or in the water. You can enjoy a picnic and relax to read a book if you wish. There are play areas for \u2026",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed my day here. The experience was definitely made by the stingray exhibit which was very interactive, and also by being able to watch the seals and polar bears swim and play from in the tunnel.",
          "A great zoo, as far as zoos go. Enjoy the polar bear exhibit and the butterfly sanctuary.",
          "I was fun and fabulous. Had a great time with family and friends, had a great meal, well served. Servers were courteous. Atmosphere was great.",
          "Great zoo!! The polar bears were amazing and the sting rays were really cool!  We didn't get a chance to see everything as we had a flight, but what we did see we had a great time!",
          "Highly recommended. Friendly staff. POLAR BEARS! Wolf pack. So glad i visited this place. All worth it.",
          "Great zoo! The staff and volunteers are knowledgeable, and there are a wide variety of happy and healthy animals to see. Wonderful place for families, and everyone who loves animals and nature. Perfect activity for good weather.",
          "Great place, awesome people to help you around",
          "This is not the zoo I remember from my childhood!   Huge new exhibits, the polar bears are awesome!   Great way too spend an afternoon with the family!",
          "We come for the tigers. A good walk from the entrance so we also see all sorts of interesting animals.",
          "I love this place. Have been going here with my daughter since her 1st birthday and yesterday was her 16th birthday. A lot of memories here and I hope the tradition lives on.",
          "SO MUCH FUN!! omg expensive however the addition of the sting ray exhibit where you can touch and feed them is amazing, had a blast with the kids :)",
          "Went here for the first time in years, and noticed something awry: the animals didn't look depressed, and the place didn't look lonely and decrepit. During my goth phase in the mid 1990s, I'd put on my leather trench coat and Marilyn Manson \u2026",
          "They did a fabulous job with ZooLights.",
          "It keeps getting better and better. Something for everyone.\nUnfortunately gate prices are fairly high but the animals have to eat and the new exhibits are very well done.",
          "Such an absolutely beautiful, peaceful place.\nBeautiful English Garden & Sculpture is great.\nI loved walking around.",
          "Super lovely... lots of nice enclosures, happy animals and friendly staff and volunteers ready to share their knowledge!!! Highly recommend it!!!",
          "My daughter loves it here, we got a membership and could go a few times a week if we had the time.",
          "I went to Winnipeg to see polar bears and in the beginning it was ok they were playing in the water and having fun but once I went outside I saw a very sad polar bear outside in the heat hyperventilating, honestly it looked sick, then I saw \u2026",
          "We didn't get to see the ocelots or the red pandas. But the sting rays were awesome! And watching the polar bears swim and frolic with a pail, they were amazing!",
          "Absolutely a fantastic place to visit with family, friends or even alone. They have animals from around the world and they have volunteers to guide you on your trip. The polar bears are the best thing to watch and the seals are amazing. Had a great day at this place. Don't miss the amphitheatre as the short movie is incredible.",
          "Great zoo and great price! My 2yo had a blast seeing all the animals, and loved being able to walk up to the polar bears glass to look in at them swim. Super neat that you can feed the sting Ray's too! We will be back the next time we're in winnipeg for sure.",
          "Lots of walking, great new exhibits, pricey.",
          "Beautiful festival lights display on for one month until 2020",
          "The light show was amazing! Will go again!",
          "A lovely walk with family. Going to be an even better area to visit once the new Diversity Gardens is finished in Assinniboine Park.",
          "Really enjoyed the Christmas Lights show.",
          "Light show was very well done.",
          "The Arctic area is great but they really need to do more work on the really long section leading to the exit. There aren't much exhibits and ends the outing on a bad note.",
          "Spend Sunday walking to the Polar Bear Site. Took two trips to find it. The maps are good, but not one sign to point the right direction. Finally get there and not one Polar bear to be seen. Very sad situation and a total waste of time",
          "I have been going to the Assiniboine Zoo since as far back as I remember. Although I love the bigger spaces for some animals, it was a shame to not be able to see so many animals too. \nI used to be able to follow a path quite well, now you \u2026",
          "I found the assinaboine park zoo to be ok.  Would like if the zoo was more , one path lead to every display of animals. Not much signage of where to go. If you don't look for the few signs/maps, you don't see all areas. Missed the \u2026",
          "We got zoo passes for Christmas, and it has been the best! My kids love the zoo. Most of the animals are usually active and easy to find and see.",
          "Amazing Lights:)  totally worth the $12",
          "Would have happily paid $10 for the Churchill exhibit alone. The rest of the zoo isnt worth 10 cents. Same rundown exhibits they had in the late 80s early 90s when I first went.",
          "Great zoo close to the city.",
          "Just watching the polarbears from below is amazing! Can wholeheartedly recommend this place.",
          "It's a massive place with great habitats for the animals. Highlights for the family was the stingray beach where you can pet them, the polar bears/seals, the butterfly garden, and all monkeys. Bring sunscreen and comfortable walking shoes.",
          "Awesome location. ... great place to spend quality time with your friends and family. ..",
          "I\u2019ve been to the Assiniboine Park Zoo a ton of times. It\u2019s fairly small which matches the modest size of Winnipeg. But, it\u2019s still pretty fun to attend. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more for families and kids than adults. And, as with any zoo, the \u2026",
          "The grounds are beautiful - we didn't make it to the zoo itself, but wow - has this area ever changed!",
          "Very well maintained and clean zoo! Definitely will be coming back!  Very friendly and knowledgeable volunteers/staff",
          "Well worth seeing the light display.",
          "The renovations they've done here have really made this a special place to be. I absolutely love the Journey to Churchill exhibit. The enclosure is so beautiful, you forget the animals are in \"captivity\" because they really do have so much \u2026",
          "Love the journey to churchill part of the park. Butterfly gardens. Was impressed with the upgrades and new park entrance. Too expensive though.was 40+ $$$ for 2 adults.",
          "Not a very big collection of animals but still good!",
          "Loved the zoo, took my mom there as we were on a road trip. She had her scooter and I walked, took 5 hrs to see the whole zoo.",
          "Really enjoy all the renos and upgrades they have been doing. As always the polar bear exhibit was amazing. Also loved the gibbon family and the interactive sting ray tank",
          "Amazingly friendly volunteers and well maintained and organized zoo.  Happy to visit!",
          "I almost got the daily recommended 10k steps in. It was fun there, though not all of the exhibits were open and occupied. It's best to come during summer for sure. The staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed eating lunch beside the polar bears.",
          "We are having a great time. It's a Friday afternoon in the crowds are small. It's a cooler morning so the animals were moving around. The staff couldn't be more helpful.",
          "The stingrays were so cool! My little guy tried so hard to pet one but he was a little too excited and scared them away. Nevertheless, it was a very cool experience for all of us.",
          "Sting day petting and polar bears wrestling were great entertainment for the kids had a blast clean and affordable",
          "Lots of the animals were out for us to see and being able to pet the stingrays was one of my family's favorite exhibits.",
          "Nice place, great seasonal exhibits. The free zoo tram is definitely a plus.",
          "Never ceases to surprise us! Best time to visit is September with most if not all animals are roaming in the enclosures.",
          "Awesome festive season light displays and entertainment",
          "Journey to Churchill is a fantastic exhibit. I look forward to seeing the polar bears and seals everytime.",
          "A great modern facility with great exhibits that are well laid out and operated by many friendly staff and volunteers.",
          "Pretty good the new searays exhibit was awesome. Plus they let you touch them.\n\nOther then that it was a zoo to sum it up",
          "A good selection of animals in decently sized habitats. There were a couple which I felt could be enlarged (cougar for one), and there was a little repetition of animals, but overall it was a good visit, particularly to see the polar bears.",
          "Loved it! I literally choreographed a dance with a seal - so smart!!",
          "Fell in love with some polar bears, even has a restaurant next to their habitat! Polar bears was definitely a highlight! It is mostly outdoors so I can't imagine the winter must be brutal to go.",
          "This is a must see attraction if you go on a trip to Winnipeg. the Zoos Arctic exhibit is incomparable to any other id say in North America since Manitoba is home to Churchill which is the Polar Bear capital of the world. If you do not \u2026",
          "It's very over priced($20.50 per adult) for what they offer. They dont have a lion anymore\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc31 but they do have an amazing albino Bison who is SO handsome(you can see him for free from the parking lot \ud83d\ude09). I can literally sum up the zoo in 5 pics.",
          "Overpriced experience.  Many enclosures have few animals, a lot of dead space everywhere without purpose. The stingray exhibit was a key part of what we can to see. But it was closed when we got to it with absolutely no prr warning.  We did experience one fantastic animal carer but otherwise was a wholly.underwhelming visit.",
          "The Zoo is really stepping it's game up.  Like all the new exhibits going in, and have always liked walking around the park.  Great place for a day out with the family.",
          "Love the zoo. Nice variety of animals, and also educational.",
          "Great experience watching the polar bears swimming",
          "Great fun time with the family. Kids enjoyed the sting ray exhibit and all the animals. Little loved chasing the peacocks around.",
          "The paths are a bit confusing, but there are lots of signs everywhere. The polar bear exhibit is still packed tho",
          "Definitely the place you need to go if you need fabrics.",

          "Had fun. Excellent staff. The free tram is nice for tired legs.",
          "First time visiting the zoo since the new  entrance off Roblyn and first time in winter.  Definitely impressed with the changes that have taken place over the last few years.  Loved the. Journey to Churchill exhibit.   The Churchill Grill \u2026",
          "Splendid experience. Fun place to visit. No lion, no elephant when we visited but there was a wide variety of animals.",

          "Feeding stingrays was a nice surprise!  The zoo is perfect size for day trippers",
          "You got come and see it all what a great spot i loved it.",
          "Always such a pleasure to come here. Staff are so nice and get you through the lines quickly. The volunteers around the park are always offering information, and are so helpful. Animals are generally lively around their feeding times so we always try and go in the mornings.",
          "What a beautiful zoo to visit! Very educational, lots of fun for everyone in the family.",
          "Good place for the price. Could use a few more animals?!",
          "Great New Winnipeg Zoo!! Loved it!  Really well put together with a huge Polar bear exibhit, the polar bears can be seen from this great cafe they made with wall to wall floor to ceiling window observation area to see them. Looking forward to seeing it again in the summer!",

          "Great place for the family! The new stingray exhibit is fantastic and my toddler had a great time putting his hand in the water and trying to touch them.",
          "Journey to Churchill is an excellent exhibit. I've visited many times and it is always a great experience. The new wolf exhibit is also excellent. I would recommend watching the trainers feed the wolves. They answer any questions you may have after the feeding.",
          "Lights at the zoo on news years eve was excellent",
          "Polar bears, petting sting rays,  butterfly garden and soooo much more. Great place to bring a toddler or kid of any age.",
          "Haven't been in years, great improvements. Pleasant afternoon",
          "The zoo has changed a lot since the 90s when I was a kid. Many of the enclosures made up of bars have been demolished to make way for the updated enclosures, such as the one for the polar bears. Some of the old attractions are still there, \u2026",
          "Amazing to explore local animals!",
          "Huge, clean and safe area. It is good place to bring for kids and families. Volunteers and staffs are knowledgeable. A place that you can learn.",

          "lots to see. animals looked happy",
          "It's an expensive outing for a family in my opinion. We had received tickets for Christmas and never saw they had an expiration date. They didn't honor them and didn't provide a discount. So, it put a sour taste in our mouth on the whole \u2026",
          "awesome took 3 hours to walk around and see everything",
          "Well worth the visit! The road to Churchill was a great exhibit! Polar bears, seals and arctic fox! Will go back next time I hit Winnipeg!",

          "Animals were kept in their natural habitat, even saw polar bear",
          "Had a wonderful evening with my girlfriend Cara",
          "Well kept, clean zoo. The volunteers do their best to answer your questions, and a lot has been done in recent years in improving various enclosures.\n\nI take my students here when we are studying animals. The presentations are engaging and our days are always well organized.",
          "Nice walking paths, but the animal displays could use some work.",
          "Today the 1st time it was hard to find parking but definatley worth the time! 4.5yr old daughter loved it. Polar bears were swimming, tigers were chewing.",
          "Great place to enjoy an afternoon.",
          "Fun place for family. Sting Ray Exzibit will have a line so expect to wait or just do it when you first arrive to get it done with.",
          "Great visit as usual. Listened to very good talk about Polar Bears",
          "\ud83d\ude0d I love the zoo! While there were a good number of empty looking habitats, it was equaled out with so many other things to see",
          "Not really a zoo enthusiast. Came for a family function. I thought the signage could be better in some areas. Otherwise, merely ok.",
          "Fantastic weather and great experience.",
          "Brought my 3 year old with an hour until close. Wish they could discount close to close.",
          "Such a peaceful zoo! Absolutely unique opportunity to see the animals up close. Especially the seals and Polar Bears",
          "We had a great time at the Zoo in Winnipeg. Free parking is such a nice thing too. I had a two scoop ice cream cone and I was very happy with the price. Compaired to the Calgary zoo it was at a realistic price. I didn't go into the gift \u2026",
          "A must see in Winnipeg. Not enough food and beverage choices. Mostly junk food.",
          "It's getting consistently better since the admission fees went up, and the Journey to Churchill opened. There are still a number of enclosures that are empty or under repair, but it is improving.",
          "Really nice zoo with a good selection of animals to see. The enclosures are very elaborate and where appropriate very spacious. The highlight is definitely the journey to Churchill exhibit featuring animals from northern Manitoba. They have \u2026",

          "It's getting pretty expensive to go to the zoo and there were quite a few empty exhibits under maintenance but my wife still enjoys going.  It's too bad it isn't open later in the evening though.....",
          "Was awesome! My daughter loved it.",

          "I have had many very good experiences at Assiniboine Park Zoo. I love the polar bear exhibit and the glass tunnel. All of the enclosures seem to be fitting for the animals living in them, at least compared to other zoos I've visited. \u2026",
          "Just a great place to take the grand kids but see things for my own interest, too!",
          "Great staff, excellent for family and huge selections of animals. \n\nMay takes a full day.",

          "Very good zoo. We got crazy on the Polar Bears in the pool above on you. Just WOW!",
          "I took my 3.5 year old daughter here and it was so much fun! We barely got to see half the zoo in the 3 hours we we're there! They were also celebrating the red panda, and had lots of fun festivities and learning experiences. I had no idea \u2026",
          "We were turned away due to no parking after being in line for half an hour.  Ten minutes later our friends were let in.",
          "It was a hot day so the seals we're active but the polar bears just wanted some shade and I didn't blame them",
          "Didn't see that much but my son had fun so it's all good hehe",
          "Great experience! Informative displays.  Nice walkways",

          "Best place\nWhole day required to enjoy\nMind-blowing experience",
          "The Journey to Churchill was fun! Polar bears and the seals are almost close to each other. The polar bear loves to empress the people especially the kids. :) Lots of animals in a little zoo. They have butterfly garden too. The entrance is \u2026",
          "friendly staff and volunteers, animal habitations are well maintained. could use an aquarium pavillon and reptarium",

          "Kids had a great time! Polar bears to tigers... and lots in between! Everyone had a blast with the stingrays.",
          "Awesome for the family. New things being built every day.",
          "Great day .nice exhibits. well done! Was there 1 0 years ago the improvements are amazing! My one suggestion would be to have local makers sell their zoo themed work. It's a shame that so many items are made in China..",
          "Great natural habitats, lacking in reptiles for sure. Was a little upset the only snake we were able to see was colubrids.",
          "Nice Zoo can see many North American animals.",
          "It was an excellent adventure. I just wish I gave myself more than 2 hours to visit.",
          "The Zoo Lights was done very well. Hoping that they continue to do this in the future!",
          "It's great lots of walking",
          "It's a great zoo. The exciting part is you get to see the polar bear close up. You should definitely check out the show \"Rhythms of the North\" it's amazing. The seals put on a great show. Also definitely do check out the gift store to take some souvenir back home. If you ever visit Winnipeg make sure you check it out.",
          "Would always rate our zoo as the best ...but wasn't at the zoo today.  Just walking in our beautiful Assinaboine park that we are so fortunate to have in Winnipeg.",
          "Very Good Zoo! Mostly Clean only thing I'd change is the goose poop.",
          "Favorite part was the polar bears. Got to see 2 of them playing around on the glass tunnel. Really glad I didnt have to pay for parking compared to other places I visited.",
          "Fairly expensive especially if you have a big family. I recall the days when it was free it may not have been as fancy but it was surely visited a lot more. If you've got the cash though definitely worthwhile.",
          "Wonderful place.highly recommend\nGreat zoo reasonable price. Free parking lots of benches for pooped parents and lots of wash rooms.",

          "Awesome Zoo! Lots of stuff to see. Don't forget to check out the sting rays!",
          "That's really beautiful but it would be better if animal variety increase",
          "Fun place for the family. Prices were reasonable.",
          "Nice place for family or group of friends. Amazing polar bear exhibit.",
          "An alright zoo overall, but the Polar Bear exhibit: A MUST SEE! Cannot begin to describe the smile on my face seeing the polar bears swim overhead... Brings a child-like sense of wonder to anyone in the underwater tunnel. The seals and bears playing around in the water made it an unforgettable visit.",

          "Really impressed with how much more the zoo has to offer.",
          "Had a amazing time really well kept zoo",
          "What a great zoo for such a small market. Worth the cost of admission. Prices in the zoo for food are even reasonable, not inflated like other attractions. Went in the winter, don't worry about the cold. You don't walk far to get to a warm \u2026",
          "Great experience watching a movie with thousands of other people in Assiniboin Park.",
          "Polar bear is super cute. Seatus the seal will follow your finger and spin for you. During winter, it is very very cold. Zoo ranger Lisa and Deborah are very friendly and detailed.",

          "Love coming here year round! Great place to just walk, as well as enjoying a good bike ride.",
          "Assiniboine Park Zoo is a zoo that is much bigger than it seems at first sight. You can easily spend three to four hours here discovering polar bears and stingrays. This zoo might actually only be second to Zoo Sauvage de St-F\u00e9licien in all of Canada.",
          "Lots of kiosks to get food, but none were open aside from tundra grill. Landscaping could be more interesting. And a lot of exhibits were under maintenance, or didnt have the same animal in enclosure as on signage. Many of the enclosures \u2026",
          "Initially I was reluctant coming here but it ended up being one best place I have eating in Winnipeg. Stop by here and allow the best of Winnipeg serve you. The staff are terrific and the place is wonderful to look at.",
          "The polar bear exhibit is unique - for Canada and worldwide.",
          "It's a great outing !",
          "This zoo has been majorly improved when the journey to Churchill was built. It's very clear that the zoo is heavily focused on the conservatory aspect of their business rather than just being a zoo. The focus is on the well-being of the animals, not just making money.",
          "My wife and I had some time to \u201ckill\u201d in Winnipeg on a stopover to Brandon so we went to the zoo yesterday. What a pleasure. The last time we were there was 13 years ago and the transformation since then is stunning. \nIt was amazing to see \u2026",

          "This place is awesome! We went on a cooler summer day right when they opened, so it wasn't too busy.  All the animals were super active!  The peacocks were really cool just randomly walking around the park.  The tiger was pacing back and \u2026",
          "What a great light show!",
          "I wish they would post/provide more info on their scientific endeavours.",
          "The baby leopards are out and about and they are pretty cool.  This is a great place to spent half a day with the kids.   Its not cheap though,  if you plan on coming here (at least 2 or 3 times) in a summer then I suggest you get the family membership.   Its worth it.",
          "We decided to get a family pass this year and it was a great decision.  I have loved the zoo since I was little and now our kids get to enjoy these moments that they will keep forever as well.  If you go more than a couple times a year, get the pass and make yourself go more often.  It's a wonderful place.",
          "The animals were active and very cute.",
          "Feastival of lights. Parking was scarce.",
          "So much fun. Kids and wife love it as well. Hope to go back soon!!!",

          "Holly Davidson band was amazing",
          "A great place to spend the day! The bugs  was a great exhibit...not as great as the dinosaurs. Would give 5 stars but it is fairly pricey for the amount of animals there are. Still, big open spaces and well laid out make it a fun place to go.",
          "It's was pretty, and the stingrays are elegant",
          "Churchill exhibit was absolutely amazing!<3<3",
          "i havent been to the zoo for yrs and i loved the polar bears they put on such a show for us todsy the whole zoo was really good enjoyed it very much",
          "Best thing I have been too since I was a kid",

          "Always something new and fun to see!",
          "Really great zoo. Loved the interaction with the keepers.  Lots of walking but its to be expected in a large zoo. The tram was great from getting from one end of the zoo to the other. Extreme bugs was fun and educational. We loved all the \u2026",
          "Love the changes that our Zoo has made since I was a child and started coming here. While it is not a huge zoo, they have a lot of variety, and they have animals specially selected to handle Manitoba winters too. \n\nThe new enclosure for the \u2026",

          "Great as always! Lots to see and do",

          "Locals love the zoo. Should be on every visitors too three list of things to do in the peg!",
          "Lots of new exhibits if you haven't been in a while, nice day out with the family",
          "I usually don't go to zoos but this one being more of a rescue/refugee zoo, is a must visit, you contribute to a good cause. Impressive amount of exotic animals from Canada and the world. Occasional temporary displays are great too.",
          "Well maintained, easy to walk zoo.  On the smaller side, so the price is a little high for what you get, but we enjoyed it.",
          "Incredible place to visit. Must see the polar bears and the butterfly enclosure",
          "It's open in the winter! It's actually nice because how few people are around. Dress warm though.",
          "Wow great to be back at the \"new and improved\" Assiniboine Zoo! Lots of new displays and modern  new look and what an amazing Polar bear experience now! You can walk under the swim tank in a  clear tunnel and really see the bears up close \u2026",
          "Very happy. Great zoo",
          "Wow. So great. Could easily have spent 5 hours here but had to cut it short after 3.",
          "The Polar Bear Exhibit is breathtaking, giving you a completely new perspectives on how the bears do their day to day lives. The rest of the zoo is pretty good too, no crowds or line ups...",
          "Polar bear exhibit is the best!",
          "Animals were very active",
          "The volunteers are amazing and the kids thought the extreme bugs were pretty neat. The baby snow leopards were cute and funny. I do miss the lions and a few other animals. The kids also loved the  butterfly garden. The only downsize is how \u2026",
          "Always great, the lights were great;",
          "Great place to bring family and friends for an amazing time!!!",
          "Get a membership if you plan to visit at least 10x a year. We come fo",
          "The Journey to Churchill exhibit is wonderful, but the rest of the newer attractions (working horses barn, Australian walkabout, butterfly garden) are worth seeing as well. The classic exhibits are also seemingly better maintained than in \u2026",
          "It is beautifully lit!",
          "Well maintained. Wonderful place to visit. Must have enough time.",
          "Very interested and the staff was great.",
          "I do not like zoos but I loved Assiniboine Zoo!",
          "So much better than it used to be.  I loved the new displays, and got to see a lot of animals!  The restaurant overlooks the polar bear enclosure, and was fun to watch the bears sleeping in their caves.  Went with my extended family, and had a great time!",

          "Knowledgeable staff, interesting animals, fun exhibits. We spent all morning wandering around the zoo; my 3 year old loved it!\n\nIt's a tad pricey as far as family-friendly activities. We spent $55 for 2 adults and a toddler. Luckily the baby was free.",
          "The zoo is hit and miss. You can't control when the animals will be active and I understand that but then offer other activities especially when people are paying $20/person. Maybe a safari type excursion would be nice. \nI also appreciate \u2026",
          "Went to the zoo. Amazing, loved the polar bears \ud83d\udc98, the gibbons \ud83d\udc98 and this wonderful room full of birds flying around free.",
          "The Assiniboine Park Zoo offers family fun for everyone! Check out cool climate creatures at the Journey to Churchill exhibit and discover over 200 other species throughout the zoo. You can even take the seasonal trolley to The Forks after your visit with the zoo\u2019s beautiful, majestic, animals.",
          "Nice place to visit with kids. Polar bears are attractive. Seals are very playful with kids across the glass tunnel. In winter walking around is challenging though.",
          "Loved the vist. And the stingrays dont feel like you would think",
          "This is a great zoo they have spent lots to change it out. The Churchill exhibit is great. They have a new extreme big exhibit too it was wonderful. A bit scary for the younger kids but well done .",
          "Superior zoo, so many unique attractions. Worth, very worth the price of admission. The glass water tunnel alone is an experience I'll never forget.",
          "The plentiful volunteers were on hand to answer any questions, assist with a lost hat in an animal enclosure and help us find our way.  The enclosures we're spacious, green and the variety of animals wide. I especially enjoyed the polar bears, snow leopards and the tiger.",
          "So good today! Animals were out playing, the sneek peak opening of the stingray exhibit was fun!",
          "Animals are well kept in their simulated habitat",
          "Why does Winnipeg\u2019s only zoo need yet another Google review? Well i haven\u2019t been to the Zoo in nearly 20 years and I was blown away by the number of exhibits and vastness of the area.  This is certainly an adventure you need to be ready \u2026",

          "Some of the animals are hard to see. But it was still fun.",

          "A family favorite spot, we have a season pass and have been more than 5 times this summer. The zoo really has come a long way over that last 5 years. The new wolf exhibit is great, and Journey to Churchill is a treat each visit. Food is decent, park is always clean.",
          "Girlfriends first time and it was not a disappointment. The journey to churchill was amazing!",
          "It was amazing. They really take care of the animals. And for the Polar bear: I have no words to describe. You need to see it with your own eyes.",

          "A great place to spend time with family. Went today and enjoyed. Not too big and not too small. This was my 1st visit and I liked the place. Has good parking space and it's free.\nTundra restaurant has a good view of polar bear habitat and I \u2026",

          "Nice experience. Good place for family visit",
          "Wish my kids were a bit older because we can't stay too long and this is quite costly for just a few hours of entertainment for the family.",
          "Watching our zoo grow and improve over the years has been a real delight. Exhibits are constantly being enhanced or expanded, and the selection of animals is both interesting and appropriate for our location. True all-season interest, reasonable entry fees, a quality membership package, and a beautiful place to go for a walk.",
          "Great zoo. Wonderful visit.",
          "This zoo was quite lovely. There is a nice variety of animals in decent spacious looking cages. There is a few places that are nice to have a little picnic with the family. And the staff at the zoo were all very nice and informative. All in all it was a very nice outing",
          "Was good. The hottest attraction was basically jam packed though.",
          "Th Polar Bear exhibit is amazing and is the only reason I\u2019m giving it 3 stars. Other then that, charging the same fee in off season as you do in peak is silly. All the extra stuff is closed for season, a lot of animals moved or not \u2026",
          "Went on a blistering hot day which allowed for a great experience as the volunteers were very eager and upbeat when helping and or approaching people. The Journey to Churchill was great as it led to the polar bears playing and relaxing in \u2026",
          "Memorable day of my life 20th may...must visit and enjoy the day",
          "The new additions and expansion are amazing! You can really get up close and personal with the bears and seals, the viewing tunnel where they swim is amazing. A lot different from when I was a kid. I miss Debbie, the old polar bear that \u2026",
          "Only saw a couple monkeys and the usual camels and bison. All other animals were absent from view. Did see a polar bear and some seals though at the end.",
          "We had so much fun at the zoo the stingrays are my favorite",
          "A bit pricey to get in, but it is a very enjoyable zoo experience. The walking trails are nice and shady. There is a free tram if you're tired, and plenty of options for snacks. The underwater tunnel to watch deals and polar bears swim is unforgettable.",
          "For the most part the zoo is the same as it was 30 years ago very sad condition the Polar Bear exhibit was nice.",
          "Was a beautiful place to see most animals were in yesterday as it was 27",
          "Loved it, especially the stingray exhibit.  The volunteers are fantastic and knowledgeable.",
          "They have great exhibits and fascinating animals! All of the animals look healthy and happy, even with the zoo in the midst of renovations. We saw the living bugs exhibit and it was quite cool! The entry prices are getting a little unaffordable but hopefully that will change soon.",
          "Great outing with the family. Days when it's around 10 celsius all the animals are out and active. Fun for everyone",
          "Polar bears are the best!",
          "I would like to thank the staff for there help on Sunday after going into medical distress. Great team work and know how.",
          "Many highlights at this spacious facility but the Journey to Churchill exhibit is amazing. On a good day, you can watch polar bears wander through the large habitat and play in the water. I don't know if there are any other facilities that show so much respect for these amazing bears.",
          "We love to spend time in the Zoo, it's always fun and has a great indoor and outdoor activities for the kids and adults as well.",
          "Love the zoo, so much for kids to see, do, and learn about!",
          "Without question, Journey to Churchill is the highlight of the new revamp Assiniboine park zoo. While the polar bear are its marquee attraction,  the harbour seals in my humble opinion are the show steppers.  They are wonderfully entertaining and engaging.

        "wiki": "The Forks (French: La Fourche) is a historic site, meeting place and green space in Downtown Winnipeg located at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine River. \nThe Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity. The site's 5.5-hectare (14-acre; 0.021 sq mi) grounds are open year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 6,000 years ago ===\nNumerous archaeological digs have shown that early Aboriginal groups arrived at The Forks site around 6,000 years ago. The digs conducted between 1989 and 1994 discovered several Aboriginal camps. Artifacts related to the bison hunt and fishing were unearthed. Evidence showed that Nakoda (Assiniboins), Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) and Sioux (Dakota) visited the site. Seasonal migration routes from northern forests to southern plains featured the Forks area as a rest stop, and the location became a key transcontinental trade link.The Assiniboine River has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River.\n\n\n=== 1734\u20131760 ===\nEuropean fur traders arrived at the site and initiated trade with the local peoples, using the Assiniboine people as fur trade middlemen.\n\n\n=== 1738\u20131880 ===\nEuropeans arrived by canoe in 1738. La V\u00e9rendrye erected Fort Rouge, the first of a long line of forts and trading posts erected in the area. The Red River Colony and the forts were all established near The Forks. The area remained the hub of the fur trade up until the 1880s. At that time, grain production became Western Canada\u2019s principal industry and the main transportation for that industry was rail rather than waterways.During the smallpox epidemics of 1781\u20131782, over half of the area's aboriginal population died.  At this time over 1,000 Aboriginal men, women, and children were buried in The Old Aboriginal Graveyard at The Forks.From 1760 to 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company competed for furs. Both companies used The Forks to store and ship supplies and furs. By 1821, competing fur companies were amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== 1886\u20131923 ===\nThe rail yards of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway were dominant facets of the Forks site, and this era is responsible for some of the buildings still standing at The Forks.The Forks Market was formed by joining together the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stable and the Great Northern Railway stable and Johnston Terminal was originally known as the National Cartage Building.The Manitoba Children\u2019s Museum is housed in what used to be the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company\u2019s Buildings and Bridges (B & B) Buildings. Union Station is still in operation.\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131920 ===\nAcross the Prairies the Canadian government began actively promoting immigration, settlement and railway development in the late 1800s. The Canadian government erected two immigration sheds at The Forks, each accommodating up to 500 people.\n\n\n=== The Forks today ===\n\nSince its designation in 1989, The Forks has contained public space for celebrations and recreation, an interpretive park, revitalized historic and new buildings containing shops and restaurants, as well as a skateboard park and historic port. The Forks attracts over four million visitors each year.\n\n\n== The Forks Market ==\n\nBeginning as two adjacent stables for competing rail companies, the horse stalls were joined together by a courtyard and bridges and became what is now known as The Forks Market.The Forks Market features a six storey tower with viewing platform, which is accessible by stairs or elevator and features interpretive panels with information on the site's history.\nThe market also comprises two storeys of vendors selling everything from fresh fruit, bread, meat, and wine to cigars and aromatherapy products to crafts and artworks from 300 local and Canadian artisans.In mid-2016, the Forks completed a $2.5-million renovation of the food hall into a feature called The Common, including a new beer and wine kiosk.\n\n\n== Johnston Terminal ==\n\nAcross the courtyard from the Forks Market is the four-storey Johnston Terminal building. Originally constructed in 1930, the terminal was a warehouse and freight-forwarding facility erected by Carter-Halls-Aldinger Company, and cost an estimated $134,700. After a substantial addition in 1930, the warehouse was at the time one of the largest in Winnipeg, containing over 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq ft) of usable space. It was occupied by National Storage and Cartage until 1961, and was leased to the Johnston National Cartage Company for the next 15 years.  Vacated in 1977, the building was unoccupied until the redevelopment of the site into The Forks. The original developers, Artis REIT, continue to own and manage Johnston Terminal. \nThe building is now home to a variety of specialty boutiques and stores, offices, a caf\u00e9, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. The basement of the building hosts the Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, which features over 30 consigners and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new merchandise brought in daily.\n\n\n== Travel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre ==\nTravel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre \u2013 Forks Location is the visitor information centre for Manitoba, offering travel counseling and trip planning services. The centre also acts as a meeting point for the \"6,000 Years in 60 Minutes!\" Parks Canada interpretive program offered throughout the summer months.\n\n\n== Manitoba Children's Museum ==\n\nLocated next to the Oodena Celebration Circle, the Manitoba Children's Museum is a non-profit, charitable children's museum featuring twelve permanent galleries. Originally opened at a different location in 1986, the museum's moved to its current building at the Forks in 1994. The museum is now housed in the former Kinsmen Building, which is the oldest surviving train repair facility in Manitoba, having been built in 1889.The museum underwent $10 million in renovations in 2011, including the addition of the Buhler Welcome Centre.\n\n\n== Manitoba Theatre for Young People ==\n\nThe Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults, located at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg. The location provides 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2) of space for the theatre to use towards its missions of producing entertaining professional theatre, providing training in theatre and portraying the experience of Canadian children.MTYP's Theatre School offers Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions, as well as Spring break and Summer camps, including classes for children as young as three years old. MTYP offers free acting, performing and film training classes to Winnipeg's Aboriginal youth between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\n== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ==\n\nThe Forks is the location of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (the first national museum outside of Ottawa). Its construction was completed in 2014.\nThe site for the museum is one of archaeological importance relating to First Nations history.\n\n\n== Inn at the Forks ==\n\nInn at the Forks is a five storey hotel located at the Forks. It has 117 guest rooms and suites, meeting and reception space for up to 200 people, fitness facilities, and features The Current Restaurant & Lounge and Riverstone Spa. The hotel features natural slate floors in the main lobby, glass vanities in the suite washrooms, heated floors, and a water wall in the spa.The Inn at the Forks project was the first Canadian application of the \u201cRedi-Maid\u201d system that links ensuite occupancy sensors, lighting and mechanical system controls to staff PDAs with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency. The hotel was completed with a construction cost of $16 million in May 2004.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Rail Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Rail Museum is located at the historic Union Station adjacent to the Forks. It is home to the Countess of Dufferin steam locomotive, the first locomotive to enter Western Canada.\n\n\n== Outdoor features ==\nThe Forks features numerous outdoor facilities, sculptures, and landscape features open to the public.\n\n\n=== Arctic Glacier Winter Park ===\n\nDuring winter, the following skating rinks, trails and snow park structures are erected at the Forks.\nThe Plaza Skating Rink\nAn Olympic-sized Skating Rink\nRink under Scotiabank Stage\n1.2 km of skating trails\nThe Snowboard Fun Park\nThe Toboggan Run\nIn January 2008, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized The Forks as the home of the longest skating rink in the world. The 8.54-kilometre-long Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail on the Assiniboine River and the Red River is almost 1 kilometer longer than the previous record-holding rink. The 7.8-kilometre long rink on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Ontario had lost its World Record title which it had held since 1971. Then in 2008 the rivers beat their own record which made the longest rink go to about 9.3-kilometres. The Rideau Canal still held the record for the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\". In 2013 the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail lost its record to the Lake Windermere Whiteway at Invermere, British Columbia, Canada.The length of the skating trail at The Forks changes each year, depending on river and ice conditions, although a concerted effort is made to make it as long as possible. In the winter of 2010/2011, conditions on The Assiniboine River made it impossible to safely create skating westward, so the path extended instead south on the Red River. Essentially, the water level and the weather at the time of freeze-up will impact the way the ice forms (see frazil ice, for example), how stable it will be, and how smoothly it can be made for skating. Much of the local river ice in Winnipeg in the winter of 2010/2011 was too rough to form a skating surface. There is also a skating trail made overland which is not impacted by river conditions. There are also walking and ski trails running parallel to the skating trail.\nWarming Huts: An Art + Architecture Competition on Ice is an open competition endorsed by the Manitoba Association of Architects. Started in 2010, the first iteration of the competition saw five local architects building outdoor structures to protect people from winter weather. In 2011, competition was opened up to international participants and included work by Frank Gehry's firm Gehry Partners. The competition has been awarded a Downtown Merit Award from the International Downtown Association. In January of each year, competition winners travel to Winnipeg for a week to build their warming huts, which are then relocated onto the frozen river for visitors to use. Warming huts are available until the end of the skating season. \n\n\n=== Assiniboine Riverwalk ===\n\nThe Assiniboine Riverwalk follows along the riverbanks from underneath Esplanade Riel to the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building.The Riverwalk is often closed due to river flooding in springtime. From the construction of the walkway to the summer of 2011, the walkway has been submerged beyond access for part of the summer for 16 out of 21 years.\n\n\n=== Balance of Spirit Within ===\n\"Balance of Spirit Within\" is a granite stone sculpture weighing approximately 10 tonnes, and is located on the north side of the Forks Historic Rail Bridge.\n\n\n=== Broadway Promenade ===\nThe Broadway Promenade is a pedestrian walkway connecting the Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge to Union Station and Broadway Avenue. Designed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the design incorporates two pathways which cross the site.  One pathway re-established the historic Broadway/Provencher Boulevard connection, and the other is a winding pathway representing pre-European contact era.\n\n\n=== Busk Stops ===\nThere are often buskers in and around the Forks. Buskers perform at stations known as \"Busk Stops\". They are paid by donation, but are prohibited from suggesting donation amounts or requesting contributions. There is an annual competition called the \"Scotiabank Busker's Festival\" at which it is decided who will be allowed to Busk.\n\n\n=== Esplanade Riel ===\n\nNamed in honor of Louis Riel,  Esplanade Riel is a pedestrian-only side-spar cable-stayed bridge which spans the Red River connecting downtown Winnipeg with St. Boniface, and it is paired with a vehicular bridge, the Provencher Bridge.\nThe Esplanade Riel is the only bridge with a restaurant in North America, and since July 2015 is occupied by Mon Ami Louis.  Former leasees include Salisbury House, a local Winnipeg chain restaurant, and Chez Sophie.\n\n\n=== Festival Park and Scotiabank Stage ===\nThe Scotiabank Stage is an outdoor stage with adjoining greenspace, built along the Broadway Promenade.In 2012, the signature events at the stage included Winnipeg's Pride Parade festival, Aboriginal Day Live hosted by APTN, Canada Day activities and the Folklorama Kick-Off.\n\n\n=== Flood markers ===\nThe posts on the canopy between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands on them to commemorate the peak water levels of major floods. Starting from the bottom of the posts, the bottom marker represents the 1950 flood, the middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 floods, and the top the flood of 1826. The flood line markers on one of the posts have historic plaques with information on the floods they represent.\n\n\n=== The Forks Historic Port ===\n\nPositioned along the Assiniboine Riverwalk, the historic port offers river vessel docking and rental, as well as access to the Splash Dash Water Bus.During times of flooding Splash Dash Water Bus employs a moveable ramp and floating dock system that allows it to operate in high water conditions.\n\n\n=== The Forks Market Plaza ===\nLocated directly in between the Forks Market, and Johnston Terminal, the Forks Market Plaza features fountains, canopies, dancing programs, several open performance spaces and patios.In the winter, the Plaza is home to an artificially cooled skating rink, under a canopy and lights.\n\n\n=== The Forks National Historic Site of Canada ===\nThe Forks National Historic Site of Canada is a 9.0 acre (3.63 hectare) park dedicated to \"preserving and presenting the 6,000-year history of human presence and activity at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers\", and is operated by Parks Canada.\nThe site features interpretive exhibits, sculptures, year-round walking trails, a dock, a canoe beach, a native prairie garden and a riverside amphitheatre for performances and events. Walking tours and presentations are offered throughout the summer.\n\n\n=== Historic Rail Bridge ===\nBuilt in 1888, the rail bridge was abandoned and eventually converted into a lighted crossing for pedestrians, cyclists and skaters.The mural on the side of the rail bridge is entitled \"Jackson Beardy \u2014 Woodlands Group of Seven Tribute\", and was painted in 2006 for Graffiti Gallery's Winnipeg International Mural Festival. The 30 foot wide and 20 foot tall mural pays tribute to Cree artist Jackson Beardy as well as the other members of the Indian Group of Seven.\n\n\n=== Oodena Celebration Circle ===\n\nOodena Celebration Circle is a natural shallow amphitheatre located between Johnston's Terminal, the Manitoba Children's Museum, and the Red River Riverwalk. \"Oodena\" is Cree for \"centre of the city\". Commissioned in 1993, the site was designed by the firm of Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm. The location features sculptures, a sundial, interpretive signage, a naked eye observatory and a ceremonial fire pit.The circular amphitheatre is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep. The 3 metres (9.8 ft) excavation for the site unearthed what is referred to by local archaeologists as \u201cthe archaic horizon\u201d, a 3,000-year-old layer of soil rich in artifacts.There are 8 unique steel armatures that rest on cobblestone formations surrounding the bowl.  Each armature points at a specific constellation, according to dates and times indicated on the panels surrounding the central stage.  Sighting rings on the armatures identify specific stars within the constellations. The supporting cobblestone formations bear inscriptions of various legends about the stars their armatures focus upon. The amphitheatre marks the vernal and autumnal equinox and the summer and winter solstices. \"The south armature features a shadow rod that casts solstice shadows on ground markers, the west armature is fitted with a wind sculpture, and the northeast armature features an aeolian harp.\" (Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm \u2013 Oodena Celebration Circle)The site has been used as a meeting grounds for such varied events as \"No Stone Unturned\", a free concert in honour of Manitoba's missing and murdered women, as well as the 2011 opening night location for THIN AIR, the Winnipeg International Writers Festival and as the meeting location for Winnipeg's Zombie Walk 2012.\n\n\n=== Pan Am Games Monument ===\n\nThe Forks is home to the 1999 Pan Am Games Monument. Located beside the Inn at the Forks, the monument recognizes the governments, companies and individuals who supported the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The monument served as the flame cauldron for the games.The 1999 Pan Am Games mainstage concerts were held at the Scotiabank Stage and Festival Park.\n\n\n=== Peace Meeting Site ===\nThe \"Peace Meeting Site\" is a landscaped resting area along the Broadway Promenade, featuring Aboriginal and European elements, notable for having two gigantic Adirondack chairs.\n\n\n=== Prairie Garden ===\nThe Forks has a Prairie Garden, which is a natural wild garden with over 10,000 plants in over 150 native plant species, including 38 prairie plants such as prairie crocus, wild iris, bergamot, purple prairie clover and wild columbine.\n\n\n=== Public Orchard ===\nIn collaboration with Winnipeg-CORE, the public orchard at The Forks contains 61 fruit trees including apple, apricot, cherry, pear, and plum, which the public can pick to eat from when the fruit is ripe. There are as many as 75 fruit bearing shrubs packed with all types of berries to pick from during the summer days.\nThere are also many education sessions through Winnipeg-CORE that are open to the public, as part of The Fork's Target Zero initiative.\n\n\n=== Rail cars ===\n\nJust outside The Forks Market are two completely restored turn of the century rail cars. One car is for display, while the other is home to \"Sugar Mountain Express\", a candy store.\n\n\n=== Skatepark ===\n\nOfficially opened 30 June 2006, \"The Plaza\" is the largest urban skate plaza and bowl complex in Canada. Announced in 2005, it was built with money donated from the J.W. Burns Family Foundation. The skatepark includes a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, and an 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) 'bowl complex'.The design features 'skateable' artwork, and is built to tolerate the regular use and enjoyment of skateboarders and cyclists.

          "Great tourist spot. Great way to support local businesses, absolutely beautiful spot to hang out all year round. Highly recommend a walk along the river.",
          "Many interesting places to browse and explore here. A lot of great places to grab a snack or a meal. The river walk is great in the summer.",
          "The forks is a nice place to see once. But the ships are pricey and be prepared for crowds. If parking weren't so bad the grounds would be a nice place to walk but there are other better places for this.",
          "Rich with culture and lots of history to take in. Make a day out of it alone or with family. Perfect for a day out. The food is awesome too! I tried gourmet burger at Nuburger. Nice.",
          "I love the forks I wish that all if the old stores were not leaving. I enjoyed walking around",
          "They\u2019ve done such a great job re vamping the forks. It\u2019s one of my favourite places to go to on a nice Winnipeg weekend, especially in the winter.",
          "Love going to the forks for an afternoon indoors or out. It's always interesting seeing all they're doing to help reduce their impact on the environment. It's a bit unfortunate they've lost so many of the little vendors that used to be upstairs, definitely miss seeing those little shops.",
          "Good place for ice skating (winter review)...small children's would definitely have good fun. Big shopping market together with food joints...",
          "Best thing in Winnipeg. HRM is worth the visit. The forks building has a great bar inside and shopping. Stroll along the river path for a quiet relaxed time. Can almost imagine the native American history.",
          "Lots of variety:\n\nIf you enjoy shopping there are many unique shops in the Forks Market and the Johnston Terminal. It's nice to explore each one for one of a kind gifts. \n\nMany different cuisine to experience.\n\nOutdoor bar near the water \u2026",
          "Winnipeg can be proud of the Forks. They nailed it. Great places to eat and shop at various prices. Year round activities for the whole family. And through in a first class hotel and a world class museum , you have the ingredients for tourist mecca.",
          "Went there to ice skate. Disappointing there is no river trail this year. Skate rentals were fair priced and fast. It was busy but not overly crowded on Friday evening. Also disappointing they didn't turn on lights when it got dark in the main circle area there.\nLots of great places to eat.",
          "They got rid of so many little shops since I last visited. Really gave the place culture, sadly I can't say that anymore. Still a great place for food! Rather than that I would give 5 stars",
          "Amazing experience. Food was great. Outside activities were nice. Lots to see.\nTower was neat.",
          "I love shopping at the Forks every time we visit Winnipeg.  There is always something new and they have some great selection of souvenirs.  There is even someone there playing live music and we were there when the local indigenous community was having a pow wow. Very cool to witness.",
          "The Forks has improved since last time I was there. Great shops and food options. Some nice upgrades to the facilities. The parking is a bit of a pain on a busy day, hence the 4 stars.",
          "Loved it! Great ambiance and good people. Everything you can wish for you find here.",
          "Since the recent additions to the forks (the commons, new restaurants, extended patio), I have found it far more vibrant. Where in the past, I would never consider going to the forks for a quick bite out at night or someone to stop before or after a show/event but it now is at the top of the list.",
          "I don't think it was much of a good idea to get rid of the outdoor bars, and start serving alcohol directly on the grounds. It makes it harder in the summer time to find a proper table to eat at with my family when most of the people I see are just sitting there with a drink.",
          "So much to see and do at the forks all year round, a great destination for families, dates, travellers, you name it. It's a bit slow in fall and spring while it transitions from lively outdoor patio to beautiful outdoor skating and back again but it's still worth checking out.",
          "Fergies Fish and Chips pickerel is the best fish and chips in Winnipeg. Fish chowder soup is also very good.",
          "We visited from out of town on a lively Friday night. The atmosphere was very laid back, and it felt like a cool community to be a part of for the evening!",
          "Love the beer hall atmosphere that has been developed here. Great food, beer, and coffee selection!",
          "Really like it there now, great central food area, the lounge on the second floor, just a nice place to spent time with friends!",
          "Love visiting and taking a long walk along the river",
          "Always great to go to this place, especially for celebrations and love the beer bar collection. It's always nice to see the fireworks that happen at forks, and love the variety of wine and eateries available to the public there.",
          "Possibly the best part of Winnipeg, I love going to the forks and if someone I know is coming it'll be the first place I suggest to go to.",
          "Enjoy the forks and all it has to offer. Have spent time there during all seasons, always something to do. Great family outing.",

          "Really cool spot to find anything from a nice pair of wool socks to a delicious craft beer. Awesome pop up shops for trendy clothing.",
          "Probably the best place to check out in Winnipeg. Food from all cultures, sights and sounds, cultural arts and all kinds of shops. The river, river boats, and sometimes live performances.",
          "This market place was really cool and while I visited as a tourist, I could imagine myself going there regularly if I lived in Winnipeg. There was something there for everyone in our diverse group to enjoy. If I'm ever back in town, I'll definitely stop back!",
          "Great place to hang out on a Sunday. Brunch at Smith in the Forks Inn lovely. Those little hot n fresh cinnamon donuts are a great finish to a meal! Nice to see young families milling about.",
          "I am always proud of being from Winnipeg as I walk through this collection of local shops. Everywhere you look is a over abundance of love and appreciation for this city and province which is largely hidden throughout the remainder of the \u2026",
          "So much to do in both summer and winter. I like the winter portion better because you could ice skate on the river and they have ice sculptures all of the place as well as great food!",
          "A little bit of everything here, Try the fish and chips! Or the cupcakes! This place is a great way to spend your morning with loved ones with a tea or coffee. Two thumbs up",
          "Very beautiful environment. Amazing lights. No skating on the river this year, but the skating trails are great.",
          "Old spaghetti factory awesome again before a Jet game. Then bought a candle from coal and canary. To help me mourn another jet loss.",
          "The Forks is probably Winnipeg's most well-known tourist destination. It's the site of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights featured on the $10 bill. So it's hard for me to write something that hasn't been said in a million travel articles. \u2026",
          "A great place to hangout with friends, unwind after a long day at work, enjoy some cold drinks and watch people. With the new patio, I can enjoy the sunlight in front of the river. Great selection of food from the market and there's always something unique to get at the shops. I will always love The Forks.",
          "This place is great for killing time and having a nice drink. Highly recommend the wine and beer flights here. Lots of variety with the food selection.  Gotta love that!",
          "Amazing place. It has kept its historical magic with modern sophistication including ice skating, bakery, food and place to relax for everyone. Must visit place in Winnipeg.",
          "The Forks is a pleasant place to go on a nice day. There's a lot of things to see and lots of good food to eat. I also like the antique store in the basement of the Johnson terminal building. One of the best antique stores I've ever seen and huge!",
          "Luv the Forks. Always something there for everyone. Parking isn't as good as it used to be but once ur there u'll find plenty of restaurants and shops with something interesting and unique. A wonderful collection of things to do and see. \u2026",
          "Great for walks, good food stands, restaurants beer and wine venues. It's a great place to visit as a local or tourist. It features a children's museum and boat rides. In winter the river becomes one of the longest skate trails in Canada. \u2026",
          "There is lots to do and see for singles, couples and families at The Forks. The Market is open every day from early morning to late night has many shops and food vendors, bakery, restaurants, coffee shops, buskers, licensed open area \u2026",
          "There's just so much stuff here to do. Bookstores, an arcade, lots of restaurants, and even a barber! Lots of fun.",
          "This is a must see for visitors and locals. The commons is a great place to grab a drink and eat. The best part about the commons is the assortment of restaurants you can choose from - there is something for everyone. In the summertime the \u2026",
          "Everytime i go there there is something new to do and love the food options. Always had fun\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Over the years much has been done to add features and social space and its definitely improved, but if it's packed there is not enough access to facilities, it's tight to squeeze through the Commons, and the upstairs has less exposure and \u2026",
          "Nice layout. And very bright. Hot food section is great for people on the run",
          "Really cool atmosphere! Plenty of neat stores to check out and great food/drink choices!",
          "When I can't think of something to do the Forks is always my number one choice. Always have new and interesting things going on.",
          "Went there are on New year's day with my husband and had a blast. Obviously very crowded but there were so much to see and experience. I thought the crowd was nice company since it gets dark early in the winter.",
          "The Forks Market is unique blend of hangout, eatery and scenic view. The Forks is the center hub for Human Rights Museum, The Forks Market, A walk on the two Rivers.",
          "Great time of the year to check out the river trails before it's too warm if you still haven't gone out yet!",
          "Great place to take kids lots to do always a good time with good food as well",
          "Wow has it ever changed there over the years for the better! Theres arcades and many great shops as well as All the Delicious Restaurants!

Steps from both the Manitoba Children's Museum and the Human Rights Museum of Canada. Highly recommend for dates, family outings or solo adventures.",
          "A fun place in Winnipeg to try local beers, shop for some local souvenirs, and local food. The location alone is worth checking out in an old rail Depot. Also close to human rights museum and the forks national historic site",
          "Delicious food, a drink menu that changes with the times and seasonal extracurricular activities/ entertainment outside.  We go here every time we are in Winnipeg, love it!",
          "Honestly it's some mid. Like it's hyped to be this great tourist attraction, got some good eats but that's about it. Anyone who says otherwise is capping. Maybe go for a skate date in the winter. Not bad but not amazing yenno.",
          "Nice park. Enjoyed the boat ride. Quite informative. Good local beers around there.",
          "Nice small mall, only partially open",

          "The Common - can\u2019t rave about it enough. Superb gathering spot for our young family (& friends). Central, casual, great food selection, hip atmosphere inside and out ! Drinks aren\u2019t the cheapest but it weeds out the crowd.",
          "Happening place with shopping dining and lots more to do.You can spend a day here.You have to pay for parking but it\u2019s cheap.Make sure to go on top of the building for some nice look around Winnipeg and take some good pictures.",

          "Nice place, many lovely little stores, good restaurants",

          "Favourite place in the city. Overall look is nice and authentic. People are always so open and it has a lot of diversity. \n\nFavourite food there is the mini donuts station or skinners lol. \nI also really like how they added an arcade.",
          "Used to be my favourite place...now it's over commercialized, the new extended patio takes so much away from the peacefulness of sitting by the river. When they decided to charge for parking and took away the candy train, it became less appealing.",

        "wiki": "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) is a Canadian Crown Corporation and national museum located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, adjacent to The Forks. The purpose of the museum is to \"explore the subject of human rights with a special but not exclusive reference to Canada, to enhance the public's understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and dialogue.\" It held its opening ceremonies on 19 September 2014.Established in 2008 through the enactment of Bill C-42, an amendment of the Canadian Museums Act, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is the first new national museum created in Canada since 1967, and it is the first new national museum ever to be located outside the National Capital Region.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 17 April 2003, the 21st anniversary of the signing of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the establishment of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights was announced as a joint partnership of the Asper Foundation, the Government of Canada, the Province of Manitoba, the City of Winnipeg and The Forks North Portage Partnership. The Asper Foundation donated $20 million.\nIsrael Harold Asper, , known as Izzy Asper, is credited with the idea and vision to establish the CMHR. He was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and founder of the now-defunct media conglomerate Canwest Global Communications. Asper hoped it would become a place where students from across Canada could come to learn about human rights. He also saw it as an opportunity to revitalize downtown Winnipeg and increase tourism to the city, as well as to raise understanding and awareness of human rights, promote respect for others, and encourage reflection, dialogue, and action. After Izzy's death in 2003, his daughter Gail Asper spearheaded the project.On 20 April 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the Government of Canada's intention to make the CMHR into a national museum. On 13 March 2008, Bill C-42, an Act amending the Museums Act and making consequential amendments to other Acts, received Royal Assent in Parliament, with support from all political parties, creating the Canadian Museum for Human Rights as a national museum. By the middle of 2008, a government-funded opinion research project had been completed by the TNS/The Antima Group. The ensuing report\u2014based primarily on focus group participants\u2014listed the following: which the CMHR might cover topics (not in order of preference); key milestones in human rights achievements, both in Canada and throughout the word; current debates about human rights; and events where Canada showed a betrayal or a commitment to human rights.\n19 December 2008 marked the groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the CMHR, and official construction on the site began in April 2009.  Construction was initially expected to be completed in 2012. The chair of the board resigned before his term was up, and a new interim chair was appointed. The base building has been substantially complete since the end of 2012, and the Museum's inauguration took place in 2014.The museum's official opening on 19 September 2014, was protested by several activist groups, who expressed the view that their own human rights histories had been inaccurately depicted or excluded from the museum. The First Nations musical group A Tribe Called Red, who had been scheduled to perform at the opening ceremony, pulled out in protest against the museum's coverage of First Nations issues.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nFunding for the capital costs of the CMHR is coming from three jurisdictions of government, the federal Crown, the provincial Crown, and the City of Winnipeg, as well as private donations. The total budget for the building of the exterior of the CMHR and its contents was $310 million as of February 2011. At the time of its opening in September 2014, the cost of the museum was approximately $351 million.To date, the Government of Canada has allocated $100 million, the Government of Manitoba has donated $40 million, and the City of Winnipeg has donated $20 million. The Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, led by Gail Asper, have raised more than $130 million in private donations from across Canada toward a final goal of $150 million. These private sector pledges include $4.5 million from provincial crown corporations in Manitoba and $5 million from the government of Ontario. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights has requested an additional $35 million in capital funding from the federal government to cover shortfalls. In April 2011, the CMHR received an additional $3.6 million from the City of Winnipeg, which was taken from a federal grant to the city in lieu of taxes for the museum.The CMHR's operating budget is provided by the government of Canada, as the CMHR is a national museum. The estimated operating costs to the federal government are $22 million annually. In December 2011, the CMHR announced that due to rising costs for the interior exhibits of the museum, the total construction cost had increased by an additional $41 million to a new total of $351 million. In July 2012, the federal and provincial governments agreed to further enhance the capital funding to the CMHR by up to $70 million, through a combination of a federal loan and a provincial loan guarantee. This newest funding was essential for the completion of the interior exhibits so that the museum could officially open in 2014, already two years behind schedule.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nIn 2003, the Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights launched an international architectural competition for the design of the CMHR. 100 submissions from 21 countries worldwide were submitted. The judging panel chose the design submitted by Antoine Predock and Chris Beccone, architects from Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nHis vision for the CMHR is a journey, beginning with a descent into the earth where visitors enter the CMHR through the \"roots\" of the museum. Visitors are led through the Great Hall, then a series of vast spaces and ramps, before culminating in the Tower of Hope, a tall spire protruding from the CMHR that provides visitors with views of downtown Winnipeg. He has been quoted as saying: \"I'm often asked what my favorite, my most important building is,\" he said. \"I'm going on record right now,\" he proclaimed. 'This is it.'\"Antoine Predock's inspiration for the CMHR came from the natural scenery and open spaces in Canada, including trees, ice, northern lights, First Nations peoples in Canada, and the rootedness of human rights action. He describes the CMHR in the following way:\n\nThe Canadian Museum for Human Rights is rooted in humanity, making visible in the architecture the fundamental commonality of humankind-a symbolic apparition of ice, clouds and stone set in a field of sweet grass. Carved into the earth and dissolving into the sky on the Winnipeg horizon, the abstract ephemeral wings of a white dove embrace a mythic stone mountain of 450 million year old Tyndall limestone in the creation of a unifying and timeless landmark for all nations and cultures of the world.\n\nThe base building has been substantially complete since the end of 2012. Throughout the foundation work of the CMHR, medicine bags created by elders at Thunderbird House, in Winnipeg, were inserted into the holes made for piles and caissons to show respect for Mother Earth. The CMHR website had two webcams available for the public to watch the construction as it progressed.\nFor the construction of the Hall of Hope full of illuminated alabaster ramps, more than 3.500m\u00b2 and 15.000 tiles of alabaster were used, making it the biggest project ever done with alabaster.On 3 July 2010, Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, unveiled the building's cornerstone. The stone bears the Queen's royal cypher and has embedded in it a piece of stone from the ruins of St. Mary's Priory, at Runnymede, England, where it is believed the Magna Carta was approved in 1215 by King John.At the time of its opening in September 2014 there were ten permanent galleries:\nWhat are human rights?\nIndigenous perspectives.\nThis includes a \"circular movie about First Nations concepts of rights and responsibilities to each other and the land.\" Curator Lee-Ann Martin described contemporary installation artist Rebecca Belmore's \"Trace\", a 2-1/2-storey \"ceramic blanket\" commissioned by the CMHR. This blanket is part of a series by Winnipeg-based Anishinaabe artist Belmore that \"expose the traumatic history and ongoing violence against Aboriginal people.\"\nCanadian journeys.\nThis includes \"prominent exhibits\" on residential schools, \"missing and murdered aboriginal women,\" \"forced relocation of Inuit.\" as well as Japanese during World War II, disabilities from Ryerson University, Chinese head tax, the Underground Railroad, Komagata Maru and the Winnipeg General Strike.\nProtecting rights in Canada\nExamining the Holocaust and other genocides.\nThe gallery on genocide includes the five genocides recognized by Canada: the Holocaust, the Holodomor, the Armenian genocide, the Rwandan genocide and the Bosnian ethnic cleansing.\nTurning points for humanity\nBreaking the silence\nActions count\nRights today\nInspiring change\n\n\n=== The process ===\nThe CMHR worked with exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum Associates (RAA) from New York to develop the inaugural exhibits of the museum. RAA indicated that the galleries throughout the CMHR would deal with various themes including the Canadian human rights journey, Aboriginal concepts of human rights, the Holocaust, and current human rights issues. The CMHR's team of researchers working with RAA to develop the inaugural exhibits.\nAs part of the content development process, the CMHR did a cross-country tour called \"Help Write the Story of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights\". From May 2009 to February 2010, CMHR researchers visited 19 cities and talked to thousands of people about their human rights experiences and what they wanted to see in the museum. This consultation process was led by Lord Cultural Resources, based in Toronto. On 5 March 2013 a story produced by CBC TV (Manitoba) mentioned a document, \"Gallery Profiles\" (dated 12 September 2012), that confirms some the CMHR's contents. The Museum's largest gallery is dedicated to Canadian content, while a thematic approach is taken throughout all of its galleries.\n\n\n=== Aboriginal issues ===\nAboriginal issues are addressed in each gallery, but are prominent in the \" Canadian Journeys Gallery\" and the \"Indigenous Perspectives Gallery.\"\n\n\n== Partnerships ==\nSeveral agreements have been reached by the CMHR and various educational institutions and government agencies, to enhance the quality and depth of information provided by the museum, as well as to broaden the educational opportunities for the museum. This is a tentative and evolving list of organizations that have partnered with the museum:\n\nUniversity of Manitoba\nUniversity of Winnipeg\nNational Museum \u2013 \"Memorial to Holodomor victims\" (Kiev, Ukraine)\nCanadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies\nAmbassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Canada (Netherlands Embassy)\nLibrary and Archives Canada\nThe Manitoba Museum\nManitoba Education (the Province of Manitoba)\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== The Forks: Aboriginal sacred site ===\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Quaternary Consultants' senior archaeologist Sid Kroker and Stantec Consulting's senior archaeologist David McLeod conducted archaeological excavations in two stages on the future building site of the CMHR museum, recovering \"more than 400,000 artifacts dating as far back as 1100 A.D.\" \nThe museum has come under criticism, including that the site selected is one of the richest sites in Manitoba for aboriginal artifacts. Retired Manitoba archaeologist Leigh Syms stated that the excavation done prior to construction did not go far enough. A spokesperson for the museum pointed out that the museum had consulted with native leaders prior to excavation. In addition, the museum continued to evaluate the site during construction. The area where the museum is built has been an area of increased development over the past few years, including a skate park, a hotel, and a parkade.  All these are south of what is believed to be a part of an Aboriginal graveyard.The CMHR has responded to the criticisms put forward by Leigh Syms, arguing that they have followed all necessary guidelines prior to and during the archaeological digs and excavations and have consulted and continue to consult Aboriginal Elders and others within the Aboriginal community about the project as it moves forward.There have been suggestions that the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, and much of the Forks in general, is located on an Aboriginal burial ground.  An impact assessment and management plan prepared for the Forks Renewal Corporation prior to the beginning of construction of the Forks Market in 1988 outlines the concerns about burial grounds expressed by the archaeologists. Several archaeological digs in the area done between 1989 and 1991, as well as the archaeological digs completed by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in 2008 and 2009, did not find any human remains.  These digs show that while the site was used for a variety of land uses, it has never been a burial ground. However, only 3% of the land the museum is on has been examined archaeologically, so we cannot say what lies beneath 97% of the museum.  In the area, prior to 1923 several Aboriginal graves had been uncovered by accident while digging for foundations.The Forks is located in the flood plain of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. Before the floodway was built in 1968, the location of the Forks was prone to flooding when accumulated winter snow rapidly melted in the spring. One of the largest of these floods, in 1826, destroyed the original Fort Garry. The Red River rose three metres (over nine feet) in one day. It created a lake that remained for months and washed away nearly every building in the settlement. Due to recurring flooding, the Forks site was used as a transitional camp.Over 50 separate projects involving excavation have been undertaken at the Forks since 1950, enabling researchers to provide an accurate reflection of the various uses of the Forks over the past 6000 years.  Despite the concerns stated above, none of these projects indicate that the Forks site was ever used as a burial ground.\n\n\n=== Proposed museum content ===\nStarting in December 2010, controversy erupted over the plans for two permanent gallery spaces: for the Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and for the injustices experienced by the Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Organizations like the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC), Canadians for Genocide Education, the German-Canadian Congress, the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (UCCLA) and thousands of other Canadians have been protesting this perceived elevation of the suffering of one or two communities above all others. The experiences and issues of these other groups are addressed thematically in the remaining galleries. With regard to atrocities, other advocacy groups have also chimed in to protest a perceived over-emphasis on the Holocaust.Angela Cassie, the museum's director of communications, responded to recent criticism by pointing out that there was a misconception about there being only two permanent zones. \"There will in fact be 12 permanent zones, and the Holodomor will have a permanent display in the 'Mass Atrocity' zone, immediately adjacent to the Holocaust zone,\" Cassie said. \"This zone will feature detailed information on the Holodomor and many other mass atrocities that have taken place worldwide and will provide educational opportunities for visitors to learn more about these events.\"According to the Canadian Jewish Congress CEO Bernie Farber, the events of the Holocaust require a special focus, because they redefined the limits of \"human depravity\" and challenged the foundation of our civilization. \"The Holocaust was also the foundation for our modern human rights legislation, and it makes perfect sense that the Holocaust should have a permanent place in the museum. It also makes sense that the plight of Canada\u2019s First Nations should also have a prominent place in the museum. What makes no sense is pitting one group of Canadians against another,\" said Farber. As for the Holocaust zone, Cassie has stated that this gallery is anticipated to include the sufferings of \"the Roma, persons with physical and mental disabilities, gay men, lesbians \u2026 among other communities.\"In a \"reply to the editor\" of the National Post, Stuart Murray, president and CEO of the museum, gave his statement on the inclusivity of the museum's planned galleries, following various protests that appeared in media after December 2010. A month later, Murray's travel expenses at the cost of taxpayers, purportedly for meetings related to museum business, also came under scrutiny. In 2013, Clint Curle, former curator of the Holocaust gallery and current head of stakeholder relations at the CMHR, was interviewed by Catherine Chatterley about the Holocaust gallery, how the CMHR is defining the Holocaust, and the general content of the museum.\n\n\n==== Inclusion of the Holodomor and other atrocities ====\nLubomyr Luciuk, speaking for the UCCLA, suggested that the museum's 12 thematic galleries could cover larger issues such as Canadian internment operations, including unwarranted detention of the following: Ukrainians and others during World War I; Germans, Italians and Japanese during World War II; and some Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the 1970 October Crisis. Another topic, genocides, could be treated as a whole, whether the atrocities occurred in Europe, Africa or Asia, and could include the politically motivated crimes of communism as well as fascism.In December 2010, the UCCLA also started a postcard campaign to try to persuade Heritage Minister James Moore to convene a new advisory committee, with the objective of reevaluating the proposed content of the CMHR. Following the postcard campaign, Luciuk stated that \"as a publicly funded institution, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights should not elevate the suffering of any community above all others.\" One of the earlier postcards distributed by the UCCLA borrowed the image of a pig, representing Joseph Stalin in George Orwell's allegorical novel \"Animal Farm\", to portray those in favor of a separate gallery devoted to the Holocaust.\nThis imagery was clearly ill-received by some members of the Canadian Jewish community, given its implication that elevating their suffering during the Holocaust above all other genocides was equivalent to Stalinist operatives trying to dominate the farms of Ukraine. University of Manitoba's director of the Canadian Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, Catherine Chatterley, criticized the postcard campaign, stating that it demonstrated \"the clear need for this museum, its permanent Holocaust gallery, and for the Canadian Institute for the Study of Antisemitism.\"Responding to public concerns, Member of Parliament James Bezan released a statement imploring the CMHR Board of Trustees to apportion to the Holodomor \"a unique, autonomous and prominent place in the CMHR\" and requested that the \"CMHR Board [of Trustees] contain respected members of the Ukrainian community with knowledge of the Holodomor and other human rights violations.\" A petition outlining the grievances of the UCC has been prepared for submission to parliament, entitled \"Petition for equity and fairness at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.\"The UCC also revealed that the tendering process undertaken by the Canadian Museum for Human Rights has no intention of including permanent or prominent displays of the Holodomor or of Canada\u2019s First National Internment Operations, providing further evidence that the Museum will proceed on the basis of the discredited Content Advisory Committee Report. In July 2012, Stuart Murray signed a memorandum of understanding with Victor Didenko, the CEO of the National Museum \"Memorial to Holodomor victims\", for future collaboration regarding education about the Holodomor.After visiting the CMHR, Luciuk provided a critical commentary, in which he stated that the building is more mausoleum than museum. The Endowment Council of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund also released a public statement; its criticism said the negative impact of Canada's first national internment operations of 1914-1920 was being downplayed at the CMHR. First and Second World War internment operations were not kept as historically separate entities, while the large-scale map projected in one of the galleries neglected to show the locations of receiving stations where internees were held, in Montreal, Toronto (Stanley Barracks), Niagara Falls, Sault Ste Marie and Winnipeg.\n\n\n==== Exclusion of the Israel/Palestinian conflict ====\nSome Palestinian-Canadians are upset that plans for the new Museum, did not include an exhibit with their story. \"As the opening comes closer, I become more and more concerned that the lessons of the Palestinian experience, nobody\u2019s going to hear it,\" said Rana Abdulla. \"Our story is an excellent story to educate Canadians about human rights. How would anyone take that museum seriously if they don\u2019t hear the Palestinian story?\"\nAccording to the United Nations, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 displaced 750,000 Palestinians. Today, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reports their descendants total five million around the world. Mohamed El Rashidy, vice-president of the Canadian Arab Federation, said the new museum will have to address and reflect what Palestinians have gone through and \"give them a voice.\" \"You can be courageous when you have this kind of diversity [in Canada] because you have so much strength. We shouldn\u2019t fear stating the inconvenient truths and facts about history.\"\n\n\n==== Response of the CMHR to complaints of favouritism ====\nSeveral people have expressed dismay at the quarrel over the square footage allotted to any given atrocity or human rights violation. While many Ukrainians believe the aggrandizing of the Holocaust has marginalized the Holodomor and dishonoured its victims, it has been argued that there should be less haggling over which wronged group gets the most space in a museum, and more concern over the prevention of human rights abuses in the future.Also, as the museum's own Cassie has explained, the purpose of the museum is not to be a memorial for the suffering of different groups, but to be a learning experience for visitors of all ages. It is to be a \"museum of ideas,\" not just a museum of past events. For example, the zone dedicated to the indigenous experience in Canada is \"part of a broader context of introduction to human rights,\" Cassie said, and will form the basis for a zone exploring the wider Canadian experience of human rights, including internment of Canadians of Ukrainian and other origins during the world wars. The zone earmarked for the Holocaust sets the stage for a key zone exploring the revolutionary 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was drafted in direct response to the Nazi atrocities.To address the concerns of Canadian citizens about how various human rights issues would be covered in the museum, Cassie provided a more detailed explanation of the actual process for public consultation and corrected misconceptions that may have been perpetrated by the media, particularly in relation to gallery content. From this statement, it was clear that the Holocaust would be in its own gallery, the Holodomor would be given a permanent place in the 'Mass Atrocity' zone, the Canadian internment operations would be featured, and the human rights abuses towards aboriginals would have a place in the 'Indigenous Rights' gallery. Cassie also explained that the Content Advisory Committee's mandate had expired in March 2010, and that its submitted recommendations constituted only part of the consultation process. The first round of public consultations that had begun in May 2009, was completed in February 2010.\nConcerns over how the Holodomor, as well as other Ukrainian and Ukrainian Canadian issues, would be treated at the CMHR proved to be valid, as described by the president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, Paul Grod, in a 2013 speech in Winnipeg. Among other points, Grod lamented how the CMHR intends to place only a minor exhibit about the Holodomor in a secondary gallery, located adjacent to the public toilets. The toilets were eventually relocated to an adjacent corridor. Nevertheless, the depiction of the Holodomor is limited and contains historical errors (e.g., the map shows the whole of contemporary Ukraine whereas only Soviet Ukrainians experienced the genocide).\n\n\n== See also ==\nHuman rights\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Bill C-42: An Act to amend the Museums Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts\" (PDF), Government of Canada, Library of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, 22 February 2008, archived from the original (PDF) on 31 May 2014, retrieved 20 September 2014\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFriends of the CMHR\nCanadian Heritage",

          "The building is absolutely architecturally special and unique. The top floor is a place to look out on the city and contemplate and think. The exhibits are educational, informative, stirring and inspirational. The staff is helpful and friendly and quite customer service",
          "Well thought out flow and design. The history and connections to today\u2019s rights and freedoms was spectacularly expressed in so many ways. You will be inspired and your commitment to truth and reconciliation will be expanded. Well worth the stop. Give yourself lots of time",
          "This was truly a wonderful museum. Whilst not the most uplifting topic, it was wonderfully done and covered all ethnicities. The Mandella exhibit was brilliant. There was so much to see and we spent three hours there and it wasn;t enought!",
          "Well worth the visit. Spent 5 hours here. Excellent displays and very informative. Have lunch here too - great easy cafe with good selection and value. If you find yourself in Winnipeg, do not miss this important museum.",
          "A beautiful, cavernous building with high tech, interactive displays designed to provoke thought and action. The guide gave an excellent introduction to a complex and challenging topic. All the staff we encountered seemed so enthusiastic and proud to work in this stunning",
          "Very interesting and thought provoking, it\u2019s somewhere everyone should visit to remind us of what human can do to each other. The staff are very friendly and helpful",
          "A wonderful museum and actually one of the very best I have ever visited. Lots of interactive exhibits to entertain and inform you. The architecture of the building is stunning and breathtaking. We were pleased to see all the LGBTQ..... content that was part of the museum.",
          "Marvellous architecture design: modern and glassware, but no much physical content such as display, items, and relevant people, but video shows and story telling. It would be very desirable to add more real content, in particular, for foreigners or other provinces\u2019 visitors.",
          "Loved it! We were told to give ourself a lot of time...we were there 4 hours, still sooo much to see! We are looking forward to going back also love the rotating exhibits.",
          "The building is fascinating! At times it was almost spooky walking up the walkways. I was glad they had solid sides, not clear glass. The Nelson Mandela exhibit was fascinating. Lots of other good exhibits too. It was fun to take the elevator to the top and look out over the",
          "Firstly the building is amazing, but that is the best part, maybe we had high expectations after driving up to Winnipeg a few times and passing the museum, but apart from the building I could not say anything was museum quality. Great research center may be? We were also able",
          "This is a must see if you are visiting winnipeg, or live here and have out of town guests. The building alone is a site to see. I do not recommend going on their free Wednesday night. It\u2019s about 10x busier ( according to staff) than a regular night. It was difficult to see",
          "The museum is so interesting, and the architecture is amazing. You can go to the very top inside and see a wonderful view of the city. Each floor is dedicated to different human rights stories, the holocaust, indigenous peoples etc. there was a specific display for Nelson",
          "If you are a museum person this place is a must . The amount of information collected and displayed is phenomenal. A real insight into humanity.",
          "Have visited the Museum many times and still have not seen every display, and special attractions are always changing. The building in its self is majestic, beautiful, relaxing.",
          "I have to say, this museum is just as powerful and impressive on the inside as it is on the outside. A must see in Edmonton. Plan to spend a good amount of time.",
          "It is an odd yet impressive building that may seem dark and unwelcoming when you first walk in....and then you find out that's the point. The light and open feeling is nearer the top until you climb (or take the elevator) up to the peace tower. And that's just the structure",
          "We went to view the Mandella exhibit. The building itself is large and seems like more could be on display, but it was well laid out and easy to get around. The Mandella exhibit was thought provoking and we'll presented. All of the other galleries we're also great and gave",
          "Toured this unique impressive museum,the architecture is outstanding with a fabulous view of the entire city of Winnipeg on the 8th floor,staff is friendly & very accommodating and eager to answer any questions.",
          "Daughter and I, first visit to the Human Rights Museum. Almost five hours viewing all the different exhibits. We started at the top level, admiring the Tower of Hope on level 8, the amazing wide ramps with alabaster sides glowing with interior lighting which won\u2019t need to be",
          "Definitely worth the visit, give yourself the day to get the full experience. Though provoking, moving and educational. Staff was very helpful and well informed on all counts.",
          "Loved it! Everyone should experience it! A ramped journey takes you through the plight and historical treatment of cultures, Ethnicities, women, religions, sexuality, racism, prejudices and beliefs in not just Canada but worldwide. The final room ask you to reflect on your role",
          "Gorgeous architecture, clearly lots of attention paid to the facility but light on displays and interactive activities. More work needed on displays as so much more could have been done",
          "This was one of the most meaningful places I've ever visited. I wish every person on earth could go through the entirity of the museum. It is so well done and diverse, it's really wonderful.",
          "A museum of an idea is unusual and in this case extremely well done. There are artifacts included but it\u2019s primarily audio visual material. You can get as in-depth information as you are willing to take the time to see. Their movies are extremely well done and very thought",
          "We had time to visit the Nelson Mandela exhibit during our busy stay at the Fort Garry. The displays were well organized and thought provoking. A must see before it closes in August 2019.",
          "This is not a museum that can be appreciated in just 1-2 hours. Although the displays are very well done and informative, the scope of the museum is found by using the technology and going deeper into each of the exhibits. Don\u2019t let that scare anyone away, there are many people",
          "We were visiting Winnipeg and had been told about the Human Rights Museum, what a great place. We spent over 4 hours reading the exhibits and enjoying a great lunch. Exhibits were well done and educational; then to top it off we had an excellent lunch in the restaurant. It is",
          "Went the on vacation. Loved the Mandela exibit. The building itself is hawesome, and the others exibits where interesting as well.",
          "This is a must for all visitors to Winnipeg. Beautiful architecture and the layout and displays of information on each level is outstanding. The special Mandela and Rohyngya exhibitions were moving and enlightening. The restaurant has great menu of snacks and meals. The gift",
          "This museum covers an impressive scope of human rights issues. Some of the texts displayed are platitudinous and some make claims that are clearly dubious (that is, to anyone with any depth of knowledge concerning the issue at hand). A centre-of-the-road ideological slant",
          "I don't know what I expected..just another museum? But it's not like any other museum. Makes you think, wonder, use your mind. Probably the best museum I have ever been to. Tours of 1 1/2 hours included in ticket price gets you started and then explore, push button, watch videos",
          "We went this past weekend, and we enjoyed our visit. We took dollar store activity books for our young children, as we were not certain that it would entertain them and were glad we did. The building is beautiful, and the exhibits are thorough and relevant.",
          "Absolutely stunning! So much to take in give yourself at least a day to explore and learn. Enter on the lower level and climb into the light. The alabaster ramps take one from one floor to the next. The staff is most knowledgeable and accessible. The cafe is a good spot to have",
          "Loved the architecture; loved the exhibits. This was an amazing museum to visit. The exhibits are very well done. The whole museum is humbling and inspiring.",
          "This museum blew away my expectations. It was so moving and experiential; I can honestly say I\u2019ve never experienced a museum like this one. We started at the top to see the Winnipeg skyline in the day, and made our way down. However, if I went again and went earlier I would go",
          "Smart to book a tour And well worth the tour. We had a Nathan give us the one hour tour and we had a ball of normal and fantastic time. What an opportunity to learn about the coins in the heritage of how they are formed made and distributed throughout our country.",
          "The content was riveting, the buildings architecture is stunning and tells an equally powerful story through it's design. We were able to take a free shuttle from the Forks there and it helped my mum who has troubles with her knees.",
          "We had just three days in Winnipeg and came here twice. It\u2019s very special. Informative, designed well, the right amount of information with facts, photos, perspectives and more. It can be done in a few hours, but our plan was that each of us picked what we wanted to see - and",
          "You will need the day to visit this amazing place of history. I got to see the Nelson Mandela Exhibit, it was very informative.",
          "Anyone who visits Winnipeg should try if at all possible to visit the CMHR. It is breathtaking inside and out. The experience literally takes the visitor out of the metaphorical darkness and up into the light of hope. Architecture is stunning, staff are wonderful, and the",
          "Went with my girls (11 and 14) and we ended up spending most of the day there. The architecture is quite unique and while not all that pretty (IMHO) on the outside, the interior is perfect for the stories being told within. The Mandela exhibit is a must see. we made it through",
          "First, the building itself is architecturally interesting. We took time to stand in various locations inside and outside to get views. It is friendly to those of us with mobility concerns and has plenty of places to sit. There is free disabled parking right by the lower doors.",
          "We were amazed at the architechture inside and out. The exhibits were all great and done so well. This museum has 7 levels with an elevator and nice ramp so you can see everything easliy. It is wide open and gives views of the entire ceiling to floor. The buidling can be",
          "The building itself is architecturally amazing and well thought out. There is a featured exhibit on Nelson Mandela currently. 6 levels of exhibits-12 galleries. elevators, sitting areas, reflection areas. ERA is an amazing restaurant so you can take your time in the museum and",
          "Allow at least 2 hours to really take in this examination of global human rights. The current Mandela exhibit is rich, interactive and very informative. Go with an open mind prepared to learn. Download the app ahead of time. Bring your headphones for guided information. Tour",
          "Was such a great place to go check out for a couple hours. I would recommend at least 4 hours but probably more to see everything. Very good if you are interested in learning history of different nationalities. I would definitely go back.",
          "This museum is a must for everyone when in Winnipeg. It is truly so well presented and very educational. Upon entering, it reminded me of the Holocaust Museum in DC and, indeed, I learned on the tour that it was fashioned on that museum. It highlights 5 of the 7 major",
          "Not only is this museum architecturally beautiful, the exhibits are thought-provoking. We learned a lot about Human Rights around the world, and feel that this is a place everyone that visits Winnipeg should experience. It was eye-opening. All photos are taken and owned by",
          "Ever since this unique and sometimes controversial museum opened in 2014, a visit was tops on my list. I finally went and---with some criticisms---it was a moving experience. The building dominates Winnipeg's skyline and looks like (depending on who you talk to) a lighthouse on",
          "Worth a visit to experience the Mandela exhibit. It was really good and very interactive. Take time to really soak it up. An amazing part of history.",
          "It is an article of faith that the CMHR is \"great\" but the truth is, aside from the temporary Mandela exhibit and a film about the Armenian genocide, it seemed a little pale. Part of the problem, ironically, is that is a good museum housed in a stunningly brilliant building -",
          "I was interested in going due to the fact the subject is important but the rates that they are charging is for me excessive entrance fees are over $25 per person I just find that excessive. The building itself is impressive",
          "Went here with friends. Being from Australia some of this history was a little lost on me. The building is very different and so are the displays. Certainly was of keen interest to our Canadian Friends. Would recommend a visit.",
          "Our conference had their awards banquet here. Appetizers and all the food were very good! We were able to go through the Nelson Mandela exhibit which was quite sobering. Well worth the time to come here",
          "A compelling museum to visit. Appropriate for all ages. The displays are profound. The Mandala exhibit is a must see.",
          "A must see in Winnipeg. The topic is heavy but so very important that we all learn of the stories shown here. Temporary exhibit on Nelson Mandela was excellent",
          "Interesting with most of the focus on First Nations issues. Layout could be improved for a better, immersive experience.",
          "We were able to tour the museum before we decided to have our wedding here. The architecture of this building makes this the most beautiful and unique venue in Winnipeg. The food from Era, and the staff looked after our every needs. Thank you for making this a seamless,",
          "This museum was spread over multiple floors. Looked larger than it was. The Nelson Mandella temporary exhibit was the best part. Learned somethings here!!",
          "Here visiting with family. Spent about 4 hours and needed more...on a different day to focus and absorb. Loved the architecture. Every display was different and thoughtful. Best museum I've ever gone to. Must see. If you live in the area get the reasonable membership and go",
          "The CMHR is a must see spot when visiting Winnepeg, Canada. The museum presents both the challenges and highlights of human rights and the spirituality of this great city. We enjoyed how we left the museum better persons than when we entered and felt the experience was life",
          "It's not the typical museum, but still enjoyed it. Better than I expected. Glad I visited this place.",
          "We were in Winnipeg for the weekend and decided to check out the Human Rights Museum for the first time. We did floors 1,2,3,7,and observation deck. Lots of good interesting information. It was okay for my 11 year old but lots went over her head and too much reading to to keep",
          "I should have spent many hours to completely comprehend and appreciate the unique experience of this museum. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to spend to appreciate all the museum. Therefore my opinions are cursory. It was a surprising and enlightening experience for",
          "This is very hard to review. You are not going to necessarily \u201cenjoy\u201d this museum. Somethings are very hard to read through/look at. However, it is also important for the future of humanity to learn from our mistakes. To decompress, make sure to finish the tour at the very top",
          "Have good walking shoes on while you tour the 7 floors. Reading everything is impossible in one visit but I tried. after 3 1/2 hours I resigned. Must return to explore that which I missed.",
          "Our group arrived and were split up into smaller groups for a tour. We were fortunate enough to have Julie Clarke. I have to say that she is fantastic! Julie is extremely passionate and knowledgeable. She is invested in the stories of the museum and really presents them in a way",
          "It's very big and there's a lot to see and hear and read. Make sur you take the time to see all the floors of this museum. There are a lot of brave people in this world and they teach us to stand up for our rights. Also stand up for the rights of others. It's a museum like no",
          "Amazing must see the museum. The architecture pulls you through the exhibits. A great well rounds museum covering human rights issue, history, and heroes from around the world and throughout time.",
          "We much enjoyed our visit to the museum. It is a stunning structure and its journey through the history of human rights is impressive. There currently is a comprehensive display on the life and struggles of Nelson Mandela that is worth the price of admission by itself.",
          "The building itself is a wonder to marvel at but touring what\u2019s inside is quite awe inspiring, too. We came specifically for the Mandela Exhibit and made a day of it. Truly a great place anyone from the city, or passing through, should see.",
          "This is a very interesting spot in Winnipeg to visit You learn lots and not all of it is pleasant, but I would definitely recommend if you are into wanting to know more about human rights.",
          "The building itself tells much of the story: the upward ramp walk reminds us of the effort it takes to seek justice in the world, the architectural curves suggest a consoling embrace, the spire a peace torch. Human Rights is as evolving as our understanding of our place in time",
          "This is a \"\"TO DO\"\" if a Winnipeger or Visitor to Winnipeg. The Mandela Story is unbelievable and so are all the other exhibitions especially the History of the $10,00 bill. One could go on and on but to difficult to single out one exhibition as they are all great and",
          "As you enter it looks like there is not a lot to be seen. How wrong that is. As you follow the beautifully illuminated ramps up, you will find more than enough to keep you thinking. This museum, in one place, reminds you and educates you about the abuses of human rights that",
          "The design of the building is awesome. But I feel the contents are not really well organized, and even a little boring sometimes. Too much words to read, and it\u2019s a little difficult for non native Enough speakers.",
          "This design and displays of this museum have a very heartful impact on a person. The design of the building is very much a part of the experience. We spent 2.5 hours there and plan to go again because there is so much important information to discover and process. An extremely",
          "The staff and volunteers at this museum really enhanced our experience. We are members and it was so great that we could park for free for up to 4 hours. The check in for parking at the coat check worked great! We went specifically to view the Mandela exhibit which is housed",
          "Plan to spend a day here if you want time to take in the whole thing. I visited on a Wednesday evening so only had 3 hours - it was not enough.",
          "The Mandela exhibit was incredibly moving. The architecture of the building is breathtaking. Each exhibit will move you in some way.",
          "We had a hosted evening at the Museum and the stories, histories and displays are absolutely heart and mind changing. Anyone living in Winnipeg or coming to visit must make a stop here.",
          "The building is stunning and the presentation of exhibits is very clever. Prepare to be overwhelmed with sadness as you are presented with an inventory of human rights abuses throughout history (and the present day). But don't use that as an excuse to stay away. All people",
          "I had the pleasure of visiting this incredible museum and already want to return to explore more. The galleries are well laid-out and nothing is done or designed without intention. The Mandela exhibit that is running right now is great.",
          "Great history in Human Rights. Especially Canadian. We\u2019re not as good as we thought we were. The history of civilization back through the ages is well depicted.",
          "As other reviews have noted, the museum (architecture and displays) is spectacular. Lighting, finishes and floor divisions via ramp added to the evocative nature of the visit. The displays led to thoughtful (and conflicting!) discussion in our family, and gave me several topics",
          "We planned a stay in Winnipeg just to see this recommended museum and it was worth a visit. The many exhibits are interesting (and sobering) at times. Mankind certainly has not been kind to our fellow Earth inhabitants at times in History. I was especially interested in The",
          "Seriously. You spend 2hrs straight walking, going up ramps to get to the top of the tower. Very interesting museum though, heartbreaking to learn some of the ways people were treated in the past and even still to this day, it really makes you think and put things in perspective.",
          "really good. The service was great and I would highly recommend this place. I went with my two parents and my little sister and we all really liked it. Once again I really enjoyed this vist.",
          "The Human Rights Museum is one of the most amazing, thought provoking museums I have ever been to. From the outside the building is spectacular, how could you know be curious to see inside. We spent over 3hrs walking through the exhibits. Obviously the subject matter can be",
          "First time visit to this museum. We spent almost 4 hours and only covered the Mandela special exhibit plus one other floor. We were also able to take the elevator to the top of the tower to take in the excellent 360 degree view of the city. In the summer when the leaves are",
          "The museum is huge and requires several visit. The exhibits are truly remarkable examining tough justice issues that engages both the heart and the mind. The building itself is an architectural delight. The exterior is beautiful:loved seeing the tall prairie grass surrounding",
          "My advice is to start at the top floor (8) and work your way down. I was thoroughly impressed by this museum. We were there during the Mandela special exhibit and it was wonderful. I truly appreciated all the hands-on elements that helped engage the museum; nothing felt",
          "Stunning museum that packs a punch. I wasn't expecting it to be so large - I'll admit that I ended up skimming through some of the sections but mostly because I was afraid of running out of time. The exhibits are poignant, comprehensive, and tackle difficult subject matter with",
          "The building itself lends time to reflect. The displays are a contrast to the beauty of the building.",
          "One of my fellow university student took me there. He show me everything. very good information for my studies. amazing place. want to go there again with more time.",
          "Don\u2019t expect to talk much once you arrive. Just by watching the videos, reading the information on the displays you become enthralled in this museum. All you want to do is learn what mankind can do to others because of beliefs, culture, religion, sexuality or colour. You leave",
          "U should not miss going to this landmark in Winnipeg as u get to learn a lot for every picture u will see that\u2019s hanging on the wall. Definitely a must see!",
          "Learnt so much! But not enough time to digest everything you see in one visit, will come back for another tour or two.",
          "Museum fo human rights is taking the attitude not in my back yard. Native reserves in the area do not have clean drinking water and it is polluted with mercury. Somehow the museum forgot to address this issue.",
          "When I first heard that our RoadScholar tour would be visiting this museum, I was skeptical of enjoying the visit. I was totally wrong. The building itself (especially inside) is an amazing edifice. Each floor contains many interactive and informative exhibits. Time flies by",
          "Wish I had more than just an afternoon to visit. Design of the building and views from it are fascinating and impressive. The contents are vital pieces of history and narratives that have often been overlooked in the mainstream, because it is the conqueror who gets to tell the",
          "Allow several hours, or better yet, do it over two visits instead of cramming it all into one time. the architecture is stunning. The displays are thoughful and informative. You will learn about the darkest days of human history AND will find hope in the stories of human rights",
          "We went to see it for the first time with our friends and it was well worth the trip. Its a beautiful building and give yourselves lots of time to explore all the displays. Lots of history ..very well done. Walk is long and uphill but there are elevators if you cant",
          "My second time at the Museum; this time specifically to see the Mandela exhibit. The exhibit was well planned with an easy flow to see and hear and read everything. The architecture is fabulous, all the exhibits are interesting and educational. Sometimes difficult to take it",
          "Friends had not yet been to the museum. We invited them to come with us and use our free passes which we had because we are members. They loved the museum and bought memberships at the end of our tour. We especially liked the Mandela exhibit. We also had lunch in the restaurant",
          "I went to see the Nelson Mandela exhibit which is very good. The museum offers an atmosphere that is conducive to learning, and exhibits that are thought-provoking and instructive. And the architecture is spectacular. There is far too much to absorb in one visit so I purchased",
          "We went for the Mandela exhibition for my first visit. The building itself is stunning and extremely educational to visit. A visit to the serenity floor is well needed and the opportunity to see all of Winnipeg in a glace is well worth the price of admission.",
          "We had our fourth visit to the Canadian Human Rights Museum and it continues to amaze us. We took advantage of visiting the Mandela exhibit and learned and experienced some of what it must have been like in South Africa Appartite times.",
          "Don't get me wrong but if there was not the free entry oncw a month I would probabli regret the money. The building is amzing and way more interresting then exhibition itself. View from the tower splended.",
          "Really excellent place to visit. Need several hours or even whole day to really appreciate all the exhibits. New facility, very well-maintained. Friendly professional staff. Entry fee is probably somewhat of a barrier to many people. Would be nice if all Canadians can have one",
          "this is a very well done museum. We saw the Nelson Mandela exhibit which was powerful. Most other displays were very well done and provocative - you could make many return visits. And the architecture is quite stunning. It's worthwhile going up to the top of the tower.",
          "The museum was a nice way to spend a cold afternoon. The Nelson Mandela exhibit was very imformative but there is an additional cost to see it. The architecture of the building is by far the most impressive part of the museum. Went once and shouldn\u2019t need to go back.",
          "This museum is simply amazing. The architecture is jaw dropping and you can\u2019t help but notice the building around you the whole time you are in there. That being said the real shining star is the exhibits that line the interior. They will take you on an emotional journey through",
          "This is a different kind of museum. Because of its theme and focus on human rights, there are not loads of \"artifacts\" as there would be in a traditional museum. Instead, the stories are told mostly through media: pictures, video, and the written word. If you take the time to",
          "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is a must-see while in Winnipeg. Rather than being artifact-based, the museum has a collection of interactive displays, videos and thought pieces that draw you in. Each gallery tackles a different angle of human rights, and the museum deals",
          "This is a totally different museum experience. It\u2019s not a walk by and look at exhibits type of experience. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, watching videos and reflecting. It takes a lot of time to see everything-I\u2019d plan on at least two hours. The on site restaurant is a tad",
          "Very thorough depiction and recounting of Mandela\u2019s story. Good use of mixed media. Gift shop has excellent things whether as souvenirs or birthday gifts. Always a pleasure when we go to CMHR",
          "As a local, I had been holding off on visiting the museum for a number of years, \"I live here so i can go whenever\". However, once a friend from NYC came to visit, I finally broke down and visited the museum and wow, I wish I would have gone sooner. The amount of displays and",
          "Just want to say we had a beautiful time at our daughter\u2019s wedding there in The Garden Of Contemplation! The atmosphere was great! The staff were just super and big shout out to Michelle Conan for making this evening spectacular and stress fear! Would highly recommend this site",
          "I was tremendously impressed with the educational opportunities that this museum offers to visitors. I have been to the Memorium Nuremberg Trials Museum & Documentation Center Former Nazi Party Rally Grounds in Nuremberg and the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the Canadian Museum for",
          "A must for anyone visiting Winnipeg. The architecture is absolutely stunning and the exhibits are extremely informative.",
          "We went there for the Mandela exhibit. Well worth the time and effort on a cold day. The history behind a great man and the plight of South Africans was enlightening and depressing at the same time. He fought for being treated like a human being and it doesn't seem like it's",
          "We spent several hours at the museum with our 12 year old. Highly recommend. Be prepared to walk as there is so much to see.",
          "Beautiful building and very interesting exhibits. I found a lot of information about human rights and their observance in the course of history. Thank you.",
          "Was more impressive with the building than the exhibits. Easily accessible by bus or car. Parking lot nearby.",
          "Enjoyed a nice lunch at the cafe and an enjoyable walk thru the museum. Lots of information, well spread out and dispalyed. Love the lay out and the final view of the city from the top.",
          "Remarkable but take all day to visit. We only had two hours so we only got to two floors. Apparently we should have gone to the lookout too!",

          "This is a relatively new museum and well worth a visit. Just standing outside and looking at the magnificent architecture of the building can take ones breath away. The museum is on 7 levels, each level explores a different area of human rights. There is a lot of reading as one",
          "I have never been here...but will make a special trip back to Winnipeg to go again. Recommend you take the 45 minute tour. The architecture and exhibits are all integrated into an stirring and provocative museum",

          "I was blown away by my 3 hours at this museum - I wanted to spend the whole day. The information was integral to the human condition - you must learn the historical lessons within those walls. It was a combination of the atrocities of history, the resilience of humans, and the",

          "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is a well done exhibit. Admission is a bit steep but it\u2019s definitely worth it. The building sits very close to \u201cThe Forks\u201d on the Assiniboine River. There is paid parking around, or you can drive to the other side of the river and find free",
          "So I went here really not know what to expect. Beautiful building, well set up. Hard to get to the front door. The whole concept was depressing unfortunately. Humanity is horrible but many stories of how we are trying to make things better. Will go again next trip to Winnipeg.",
          "This is one of the best museums I have visited. The subject matter did not fudge any of the issues, it was sensitive where necessary and blunt when it needed to be. It cannot be rushed, I would suggest a minimum of 4 hours to give it justice. It will bore small children, best to",
          "Amazing, Awesome, Sobering, Informative, Educational. A must do!! We only had 2 hours here you could spend all day! It is vast. 6 levels of educational, interactive and interesting information on our poor human rights records. Very sobering. It bought tears to my eyes. We need",
          "What an amazing museum. The architecture itself is worth the visit. The exterior of the museum is beautiful. Inside the museum a series of lit alabaster-covered ramps lead you from the main floor all the way to the top floor. The top floor is called the Tower of Hope and it",
          "Just the architecture is worth the visit. Best to take elevator to top then walk leisurely all the way down. Wednesday evenings are only $5 and the first Wednesday of every month is FREE!! Lots of high tech to see - take your time to read the stories Whole musem demonstares",
          "Well worth your time to visit this thought provoking museum. Plan on stending between 2 to 3 hours immerseing yourself in the well laid out multimedium exhibits. I would recommend the guided tours for groups to stay on track and get the most out of the visit, however, couples",
          "This was our first visit to this very interesting and sobering museum. We just skimmed the surface as it would take at least several days to take it all in and we will have to go again the next time we are in Winnipeg. Every Canadian should see this.",
          "We took the guided tour - highly recommend doing this! Canada doesn\u2019t try to hide it\u2019s past mistakes, but does demonstrate what they are doing to rectify things. We learned a great deal, and were also impressed with the sheer beauty of the facility and the thought and planning",

          "Visited in January 2018 while staying at the Fairmont Hotel. The amount of information is overwhelming and the emotions of the visit move one's heart to feel the events of the different peoples challenges, the harm they experiences and man's in humanity against man.",
          "For starters, the architecture of this building is amazing in its own right. However, the focus of the exhibits are very unique as it is a walk down the road of human rights and is very educational. The exhibits incorporate both Canadian and international human rights efforts",
          "Firstly, I live in Winnipeg but it took my wife and I a few years to finally tour the museum. The architecture and exhibits were well thought out and engaging. You will need to take the time and prepare to spend at least 4 hours to soak in, and you will still not be able to see",
          "We did the guided tour and found it really helpful. We didn't manage to do all of the exhibits in one visit - as we were told, there's about 80 hours of content in english, and about three hours was enough for us in one go. looking forward to returning next time.",
          "Excellent facility- recommend everyone see this if traveling or a Winnipegger. The facility is terrific, location and the exhibits. I will be bringing family and friends here again and again",
          "The layout and content of the museum is superb. Interestingly engaging with short videos, real life experiences and interactive activities. It is very thought provoking and quite an emotional journey, thankfully there are beautiful area to sit and reflect before each level.",
          "Something every Canadian should see. Definitely an all day activity. There are 8 floors to cover, so lots to learn! You don\u2019t have to be a historian to appreciate the humanitarian value it\u2019s humanitarian value and importance. The museum covers thousands of years on hundreds of",
          "Special building just to see. I joined a fantastic tour that would definitely recommend for anyone in the museum for the first time - a lot of insight into history behind why it was built and how we are meant to navigate it let alone cool explanation of each level of the museum.",
          "This museum is the best I have ever been to- it was very handicapped accessible and was so interesting and emotionally moving! I loved it!!",
          "The architecture was magnificent with excellent views from the top. The content was very intense and educational as it is all about Human Rights. It takes a min 2 hrs to walk through with basic views of the provided information booths. It would take a min 4 hours to listen and",
          "We are retired and travel all over. This, arguably, is the nicest, most informative museum we have ever visited. We allowed 4 hours and spent almost 6 seeing everything. Do not miss the Mandela Exhibit. It is very moving experience. The museum does not sugar coat Canadian",
          "We're passing through Winnipeg and noticed the building yesterday and thought a human rights museum sounded interesting. We intended to spend maybe 2 hours here. Five hours later the museum was closing so we had to rush up to the observation level. It is an outstanding museum in",
          "Give yourself a minimum of 2 hours, excellent museum. I felt bad that those who cannot afford the $21 entrance fee and would be excluded from going.",
          "This is a very nice museum to visit. The building is unique. It takes 1 day to enjoy all the expositions. I learned a lot about human rights, a very sensitive topic nowadays. The staff is very friendly.",
          "Every facet of this interactive place is a story. This is less a museum, than it is a place to reflect on the past and raise awareness of the present and to spur resolve for change and vigilance in the future.",
          "I love visiting this Museum. All the architecture has a symbolic meaning. Their personnel is very friendly and helpful. you will find different exhibits ranging to different topics. take comfortable shoes to walk through this journey!",
          "We went to the top first for the view. We then worked our way down concentrating on floors 4,3 and 2. This is a visit that I would recommend to everyone. I learned a lot about the abuse of human rights and reinforced things that I did know. The helpers were amazing and always",
          "Not a lot to say really. It is well worth a visit although it concentrated in the main on Jews during the 2nd world war and Vietnam. There are gaping holes in it like Franco in Spain, the Russians wiping out a race as well as millions of Jews. If I Am in glanced over, but saying",
          "This Museum, one of only two National museums located outside the National Capital Region, focuses on many aspects of Human Rights issues-- not only in the \"Canadian setting\" but also \"internationally\". It also looks at the many issues from an Historical as well as the Current",
          "Thank you to our guide who provided us with a lot of interesting information and was very personable. I am sure she passed her appraisal (happening during our tour). I didn't spend enough time here and will need to go back. The building itself is a beautiful piece or",
          "Superb architecture, from inside also! Well worth a visit, and plan 3-4 hours. Consider Wednesday evening for only 5$!",
          "My wife and I spent 4 hours here and could easily have spent 8 more. The bottom floor had an exhibition on Nelson Mandela and apartheid which told in detail the shame of that era in South Africa. The floors above told the story of human rights in Canada and the world. The",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. While the subject matter is obviously sensitive and rather difficult it is important and it is presented in informative and interesting ways. We learned a lot. There is a lot to see and do and a day is really not enough time to see it",
          "This is a must visit in the heart of Winnipeg. The architecture inside and out is fantastic. All of the finishing materials are spectacular. The exhibits are exceptionally well done and are very moving. Many bring you to tears. The Mandela Exhibit is very well done. We spent 4",
          "We went out to the Museum for Human Rights thinking it would just be a couple of hours but we ended up spending a solid 4 or 5 hours in there. The exhibits are excellent and they have some great items, in particular in the Nelson Mandela section where they have got some great",
          "My partner and I grew up in Winnipeg area and were back for visit. The museum is a must. We only had a couple hours and didn\u2019t get to a lot of it. The language greeting falls a bit flat and it seems trite but the doors leading into it were so underwhelming this was definitely a",
          "Eight stories of wasted space. Starting with the architecture - expensive curves, platforms, empty space. Waste of taxpayers\u2019 and donors\u2019 money. Next, the exhibits. Not that many, considering the space. The ones that are there, are well labelled. The Nazi death camps exhibit",
          "THe Canadian Museum for Human Rights is a fascinating museum with a wonderful exhibit on Nelson Mandela currently on display. I was surprised there was no mention of the Armenian Genocide which seems appropriate for a museum such as this. Otherwise, great content.",
          "Mandella, struggle for freedom, was so educational, and interesting. So much information, displays are well done, the building itself is amazing. You need several hours to go through all levels.",
          "The only national museum outside of Ottawa. You may be well informed on the history displayed inside - but the interior architecture is truly amazing and adds another dimension to the visit.",
          "We live in Winnipeg and after a couple of years finally made it for a visit. We were impresed by many things, the displays, the special exhibition and the architecture and views. We enjoyed it so much, we became members after our first visit.",
          "Winnipeg really needed something like this. It covers such a wide variety of world issues, past and present. Highly recommended for anyone. Plus the view from the top is beautiful.",
          "my daughter was visiting so we went to see the Nelson Mandela special exhibit and the rest of the museum. It was marvelous, but a lot of reading as well as actual exhibits. so very informative. Then the real walking started (yes they do have elevators). There are 6 exhibit",
          "Visiting this museum is a somber experience that shouldn't be rushed. There is so much to take in. The exhibits are tasteful and informative, and they include many interactive aspects. Highly recommend.",
          "engaging, enraging, thought provoking, insightful, balanced, sobering, remarkable...Very difficult to capture thoughts on this museum. I am so glad I visited and that my teen daughters also experienced it. It is a perfect balance of presentation mediums so it's not all reading.",
          "A museum filled with information on human rights atrocities through the ages. You may think it depressing, but there are many positive messages throughout. The building is unique and naturally leads you from one exhibit to another. For those with fear of heights, beware! The",
          "Museum was great to see and learned at lot about Canada and out involvement inhuman rights. If you are a person that has issues walking have to start at the top and work your way down ( 7 floors) . There are thing that I was glad i went to see but a lot of walking from floor to",
          "Everyone has to visit this place at least once.You learn about history. I was there for Mandela 100 and it was very emotional but i was amazed by the information they was exposed because usually that kind of info is hidden from the public",
          "Canada is a world leader in championing human rights. This museum both celebrates that and not-so-gently reminds us where we could do better. A truly awesome feat of architecture, technology, and history which reminds you that everyone else is human, too.",
          "This is located downtown Winnipeg at the Forks, which is worth a visit. This museum is expensive and parking and traffic can be an issue during the week.",
          "Sometimes we just need to pause and reflect on where we have been to inform us of our journey forward. This is not a place of entertainment. Nor should it be. It is a place of necessary introspection. The architecture is amazing - it takes you from a dark, cavernous space,",
          "Last afternoon in Winnipeg, my teenage son and I decided to visit this strange yet beautiful looking museum. We sure glad we did. The special exhibit was on Nelson Mandela, it was worth every penny!! We went thru the whole building about 3 hrs long. We sure appreciate the",
          "On a hot day, this was a breath of 'fresh, cool air'! More than that it was also a fresh look at Human Rights and how they were acquired by a large part of Earth's population. Interestingly, the building was constructed in a way that makes the visitor 'feel' the intense effort",
          "You likely will need two visits to avoid overload as the details are exquisite. I go quite often and have a membership pass. I take friends and new immigrants often. The architecture is outstanding. Do your legs a favor and start at the top. Wonderfully wheelchair",
          "I live in Winnipeg and this was my first visit to the Museum, but certainly will return as there is so much to take in. Next time we are going to start at the very top and work our way down. Wonderful view of the city from the top of the tower. The Mandela exhibition is very",
          "When we went (summer 2018) there was a very interesting and moving exhibit on Nelson Mandela and Apartheid. It was imaginative, comprehensive, and engaging. The building itself is a marvel - moving up from the very dark base level to increasing light as the theme of the museum",
          "This is an absolute must if in Winnipeg. Sounds a bit boring but it's the most facinating and well thought out museum dealing with a very difficult but nessasary subject. The building is also a real jem. Cafe and shop also worth a visit. We also visted the Mandela exhibition",
          "This museum is worth a visit no matter where you are in the country. It is a thought provoking and thoughtful review of the best and worst of humanity. Every school (Grades 6+)within reasonable proximity should include a trip to this museum. The displays, subject",
          "We spent nearly 4 hours here and only managed about half of it. Thought provoking, interesting, scary that so much injustice has occurred in our lifetime. The guide we had was very good although occasionally he seemed to oversimplify history. - but perhaps it's us that make",
          "This museum is worth a visit if you're at all interested in how badly humans have (and will continue to) treat each other, unfortunately. The themes are somber and thought provoking, as they should be. The architecture alone of the building is worth seeing, pretty complex",
          "The museum was beautiful, but not the people. One of the sicurity guards grabbed parts of me that shouldn\u2019t have been touched, I knew he done it on purpose because he winked at me after wards. Then the beg check refused to give me back my bag even when we had the card. There was",
          "I recently visited this museum and really enjoyed my visit. There was a lot of information on offer to take in! The museum is spread over six floors and currently the temporary exhibition is on Nelson Mandela. I particularly enjoyed the sections on the First Nations, Innuit",
          "Great museum covering many aspects of human rights in Canada but also the world, outspoken to the struggles as well. Mandela exhibition is awesome. Spend 4 hours in there - not to be missed!",
          "First time here. I was aprtof a special group and got a 1 1/2 hr. guided tour. This gave us a quick overview of the museum. next time we are in Winnipeg, I plan to give it 2 days to really see everything. Nelson Mandela exhibit is on at this time. Regular price is $21, youth",
          "It's worth taking a trip to Winnipeg just to visit this museum. The architecture - inside and out - is absolutely stunning. The approaches and the location - near the excitng Forks, the historic CN train station and the Red River - as well as the landscaping, all add to the",
          "The museum is brilliant! Architecture is amazing. Architecture flows with the progression of human rights change. The \u201ctower of hope\u201d sits at the height of it. Each floor is separated with a very long ramp that zigzags to the next floor. It is gorgeous, so I suggest you take",
          "More detailed information than one can grasp in one visit. There are some activities for children, but geared more for adults. Be sure to go to the top, as the 360 view of Winnipeg's downtown is spectacular on a clear day. Lots of parking, but a long walk to the entrance.",
          "Obviously human rights and what are considered human rights is constantly debated and past experiences for certain people can be quite sad to hear about. But this museum is very informative and shows the concept of through perseverance we can find hope. Few to none of the topics",
          "I have to start off saying that I was a little unsure about what the museum would be like. I was concerned that it might be really \"preachy\", over the top and strangled in political correctness. Well, I have to say that it was none of that. The museum was very impressive",
          "Stopped by because it was so highly rated. Hours are very limited, cost is high, we were later on in the day getting there and staff said it would be a waste of money to go in , come back another time. That did work in our schedule.",
          "This museum contains so many exhibits! It is the best way to spend an afternoon. The staff and volunteers are friendly and very knowledgeable about the architecture and the exhibits. During our visit, the Nelson Mandela exhibit was at the museum. Incredible!!!!",
          "Fabulous building with a vast amount of information inside. I recommend you take a guided tour, go away and then come back another day to absorb more of this fantastic space. There is too much to take in in one visit and it requires concentration.",
          "Our conference group went to the Museum for a guided tour which was about 90 minutes in length. Then we had free time to explore on our own. Our buses were there to pick us up much too early. It is a fantastic museum to explore. You need to go more than once as it can be",
          "The staff are very knowledgeable. There are always people nearby to direct or education you on the displays. You learn something new every time you visit.",
          "While I appreciate the educational purposes of this Museum for the most part, I felt there was some information missing w/ regard to the timeline of Human Rights history. Nevertheless, I did find the focus of South Africa \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 & Nelson Mandela, Louis Riel and the Metis, Viola",
          "This is a \u201cdon\u2019t miss\u201d stop if you\u2019re in Winnipeg. In fact, it\u2019s worth making a trip to Manitoba purely to take in the Human Rights Museum. The thought-provoking exhibitions cataloguing human right violations can be difficult to view so bless the architect for creating the",
          "I made 2 visits to the Museum when I was in Winnipeg earlier this month. The first was a guided tour to give me (and the group I was with) an overview of the content of the Museum. The second visit, which I made by myself, was to delve further into areas of interest for me. I",
          "Great journey through a very difficult issue that is ever present in our world. Extremely well displayed and written focus on a broad spectrum of issues. The current Nelson Mandela exhibit is well done.",
          "The building and displays are so well thought out. There is over 100hours of interactive displays which show so much respect for humankind from the beginning of man as we know him. We need to know this history and learn from it.",
          "By visiting this museum you will be doing yourself a favor. It is definitely worth the time and not to be missed. The building is a gem in architecture. Take a break at ERA restaurant on the main floor which is excellent and then continue your visit.",
          "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights should be a must see for anyone visiting Winnipeg. The building's architecture and the contents of the museum itself are fascinating and offers a chance to delve deep into what human rights really are. Highly recommend a visit to the museum",
          "I spent a morning here last month. The people are kind (right down to the coat check people and the security guard who gave me directions), the building is beautiful and the displays are excellent. It blows me away, the extent of human rights issues in Canada alone over the",
          "The building looks interesting from the outside, but the inside is mostly an empty shell with lots of steep ramps between floors. The propaganda displays are all very politically correct, one-sided, and non-controversial. The first display, listing the milestones of the history",
          "I spent around 3.5 hours exploring during a visit to Winnipeg and it was so worth it. This is an experience not to be missed. It should be required for all Canadian high school students. I learned so much about our country's bloody history and the negative impact Christianity",
          "The architecture was impressive, as were the grounds and setting. To get to the exhibits was a long walk up a winding ramp, something like the Guggenheim, but without anything displayed on the walls. I'd suggest a visit of a couple of hours, although certainly a longer time",
          "Advice is to take the elevator to the top and work your way down through many and I mean many ramps with displays on various floors. Holocaust display on 4th is the best. Sadly the facility has too many displays with just words and does not integrate the displays and the design",
          "I great educational way to spend an afternoon (minimum 2 hours to get through). This is an amazing building on its own, with insightful, well done exhibits, and informative presentations. The museum recognizes some of the darkest days in our Canadian history as well as that of",
          "If you could visit one attraction I think this is it. A lot of walking on inside ascending walkway, displays were interesting and varied. View from top observation deck spectacular. The exhibits are varied in their layouts and well done, well worth time spent.",
          "The architecture is amazing, be sur to go a guided tour and discover the story of the building of this museum. The exhibits are outstanding and very well done. This truly relives the history of our world.",
          "The various informative and interactive displays help to explain Nelson Mandela's journey from prison to freedom, mistreatment of people of ethnic race and gender, the road to equality, the right to vote, and so many things we take for granted today. Some areas can be quite",
          "Human rights is something we generally take for granted but the museum does a great job educating us that it isn't the case for everyone around the world. At times, it is difficult to see what humans could do to each other but we must remember or else we will forget and others",
          "I went to tour this place yesterday. It is a magnificent and unusual type of building. There are 8 galleries plus a special gallery that currently houses a Nelson Mandela display. The guides and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. Pictures and varieties of displays all",
          "The museum could be better in its displays and more interactivity. I was very disappointed with what I saw. Better Human rights museum in Ottawa. The building itself looks like a Nazi-helmet.",
          "First off there is the Nelson Mandela Exhibit. Absolutely amazing. Shows you how cruel and terrible oppression can be just because you have a different ethnicity. Then the other floors have descriptions of other states that oppressed their people. It is very interesting and soul",
          "This place should be on your top list to visit... Time well spent for the whole family.. History comes to life as one visits the various galleries. Information compiled reveals events which have shaped the country we live in.",
          "Very very interesting museum! Very focused on the holocaust but it gives great insight in to other historical events as well. Don\u2019t expect to be able to read it all in one shot! I\u2019ve gone back several times and seen different parts every time. It\u2019s fairly interactive but a",
          "Well worth your time when visiting Winnipeg. The museum's content is excellent and not your usual collection of artifacts in display case. The temporary exhibit on Nelson Mandela was really good. Spent 3 hours but could have spent more to cover all the content. My two teenage",

          "The architecture of the museum alone was well worth the price of admission. The exhibits were presented in both English and French and the museum is very interactive and informative.",
          "It tells the story of human rights at various points in time. The Holocaust exhibit was especially thought-provoking.",
          "Informative and thought provoking exhibits with an amazing architecture. The meditation garden and view from the top are stunning!",
          "I was blown away by this museum. The contents, the architecture and the people are all world class. You could visit this museum in half a day but to truly appreciate it, I would strongly suggest taking at least 5 hours. Also, the restaurant in the museum is very good.",
          "You will be amazed at what you will learn from a visit to the museum. Very informative, loved the Mandela exhibit. It is great how they incorporated interactive displays. You will need a couple of hours to go through, but it is time well spent.",
          "Drove up from Fargo to visit this treasure in our backyard. Well organized and thoughtful presentation of vital information to connect our humanity. All rights are human rights. We need this message today more than ever.",
          "Really enjoyed my visit here, and the Nelson Mandela exhibit was amazing. Didn\u2019t get to all the main exhibits and would like to come back. Also a good gift shop!",
          "Felt like a mandatory tourist experience in Winnipeg. We were lucky to visit the first Wednesday evening of the month and got in for free. A very wide topic and difficult story to tell. A variety of exhibits honor the stories of various marginalized groups. The overall effect is",
          "Visited the museum with colleagues. It's a different experience. Makes you appreciate what we currently have. We had free admission because of the program but you would normally pay admission fees. Take advantage of the free admission on free general admission on the first",
          "A very thorough depiction of human rights progress (and lack of it) through the years in an architecturally stunning building. Don't miss the Mandela exhibit.",
          "Winnipeg residents should be proud of this gem of a museum. The Mandela exhibit is a must-see - very powerful images and the history of Nelson Mandela. I was impressed with staff showing me where something was instead of pointing.",
          "We have visited many museums all over the world and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is by far, the best! The museum is an architectural marvel and is so aesthetically pleasing! Fortunately, for us, the Nelson Mandela exhibit started the day that we visited. Although the",
          "This museum is one of the best in the world. We planned to spend a couple of hours here and in the end stayed over five hours. Everything about it is thoughtfully and intelligently done, from the design of the building which is in tune with the museum's content both inside and",
          "a must see. Sad to see what people went through. certainly an eye opener. Would be a whole day. With our schedule we saw Mandela, Indigenous and the holocaust.",
          "There Is a lot to take in with so much to see. Be prepared to read a lot as the exhibits are quite extensive . Also a lot of walking is required to see eveything but you can spend all day there and more if you want to see it all . It does have more than you expect and does show",
          "Took advantage of free entry on Tuesday nights. You could easily spend a whole day here. My recommendation is take the elevator to the top and start there, your legs will thank you since the museum is set on 7 levels with sloping walkways between each.",
          "There is probably no other museum for human rights in the world. This is a thought-provoking place. It is also a work of art, as a hyper-modernist building. The wrap-around western facade is a miracle of architecture.",
          "This is a wonderful place in Winnipeg. Highly recommend for everyone. The layout inside is a little confusing, but there are abundant staff to ask. We parked at the Forks market for free and visited it after the museum",
          "I reviewed the Museum with one reservation: I wrote it had a RIGHT WING viewpoint...I MISPOKE...intended to say LEFTWING...this was based upon the exhibit of the Quebec Crisis, which we experienced first hand when there was an explosion in our Ottawa hotel room and a",
          "We are all victims. We are all perpetrators (enablers by doing nothing, inadvertently or otherwise). The traveling Mandela exhibit was a powerful reminder of all this. His cautionary words about freedom being a journey, not a destination, uttered in 1994 are prescient and",
          "Amazing architecture. From darkness to light. How creative. Makes you think, feel. Too much ro see in one visit. Recommend a guided tour on first visit. Discover something new every time I go. Have gone over a dozen times.",
          "This building is phenomenal. The top floor is all glass with beautiful views of the City. There is a ramp walkway down surrounded by glass. The Museum itself is amazing. The graphics on each floor are worth the visit. The first floor , right now, is housing the Nelson Mandela",
          "A lot of thought has been put into this museum. The docents are passionate and knowledgeable about the exhibits. Because we were in town for business we only had time for a quick 2 hour tour. I could easily have spent double that time as there was so much to take in. The",
          "The building is absolutely beautiful inside and out. There are many vantage points where you can take a break and overlook many areas of Winnipeg. The exhibits are humbling and a good reminder what we have been through to get where we are and what still needs to be done. Always",
          "A spectacular building, but I expected to find the exhibits heavy and boring. Was I wrong! I arrived at 11AM and had to leave because of closing at 5PM. I thought I'd be in and out in an hour. Such a moving experience. Everyone who lives with the freedoms that we take for",
          "If you want to see, hear and experience the history of human rights, the good, the bad and the ugly then you must visit here. Odd thing is that the exhibits get smaller as you go up each floor until you reach the top and find out that you can take stairs or an elevator to the",
          "Attended the Museum as the Dinner location for a conference we were attending. It was the perfect backdrop for our Global Summit, and was so please to have an opportunity to enjoy the exhibits quietly prior to dinner!",
          "The Human Rights Museum is a \"must see\" if you are in Winnipeg. You will not be disappointed with your experience. Plan on an entire afternoon so you can take your time through the eras and read all about what was happening at that particular time.",
          "we passed by the museum we had not enough time to go in but the building from outside is lovely. we were informed that it contains information on the whole of Canada and not just Winnipeg",
          "I had visited this museum two times prior to this visit. This time we arranged a tour for our group of ten friends who had travelled to Winnipeg for a long weekend. The tour was fantastic with a very knowledgeable young tour guide who gave us architectural information as well",
          "We visited for the better part of two hours and just skimmed the surface of this remarkable museum. The architecture inside and out is a draw all on its own. Admission is $21. There are so many attractive aspects of the various displays and venues on the different levels, you",
          "Very interesting but will take lots of time as this museum requires a lot of reading for most of the exhibits",
          "The building is an architectural wonder. So much to admire. The ramps are a highlight. The vast open spaces make the inside seem outdoors. The exhibits are a bit weak and the obvious benefits of technology (eg an AR app seems an easy thing to enhance the visit) missed. Still",
          "My husband and I spent several hours here, and really learned a lot. The displays are perfect, and so informative. We enjoyed the walk up all the ramps to the next levels. A very unique building.",
          "Absolut stunning architecture and the mix of audio and video material was very well done. Defenetly plan a half day or longer for your visit!",
          "I think I am addicted to CMHR. Every time I visit I experience something new. My most recent visit was to take in the Mandela exhibit, which was thorough and informative. If you really want to absorb what CMHR has to offer, set aside enough time to experience the 8 levels and",

          "Thank you to the museum staff and our guide for a humbling tour of a well done, wide ranging project.\n\nThey managed to balance the difficult subject matter presented by many of the exhibits with hope and inspiration from examples of \u2026",
          "Every Canadian should experience this museum. As its name implies it deals w milestones and setbacks of human rights, an important issue today in light of populist tendencies.",
          "I have been to many museums but this one had me speechless! I was impressed with how great this museum is. Love how the storyline is built and how easy to understand it is, the way the stories and topics are portrayed is amazing. And not to mention the amazing building and view of the city. I\u2019m in love!",
          "Awesome time with a large group. A lot of learning, cool and interactive peaces. Great and friendly staff. the view of Winnipeg at the top is amazing. A must visit in Winnipeg",
          "I'm not a history buff, nor am I that interested in it, but they have some nice exhibits, most read out information to you.  Its very modern, I actually liked the tour.  I even listened to most of the exhibits, they made it interesting !!!  Well done !!!",
          "The museum is set up well so that it is accessible for people with a variety of abilities and interests in human rights. There is a vibrant visual component, interactive exhibits, traditional museum exhibits and all of this was set in a two \u2026",
          "Wonderful visit... needed more time. Lots to see.",
          "Very, very interesting. Absolutely beautiful building too. I really enjoyed reading the exhibits, and found the current exhibit on Nelson Mandela incredibly interesting.",
          "Very interesting tour. We're definitely going to come back for more. We only touched a top of the iceberg.",
          "Amazing, powerful place. Went here for a work event and our tourguide David was outstanding. Would recommend this to anyone!",
          "Absolutely loved this museum! The architecture is just so visually stunning!! The staff was very informative and welcoming and the exhibits were very well maintained and laid out. There was complimentary coat check and a restaurant on site. \u2026",
          "Great experience. Best part was the view from top. I really enjoyed.",
          "Nice display of Nelson Mandela. Tickets are over-priced for the size of the display.",
          "Absolutely incredible museum and a must see spot! The architecture alone is amazing but the content is a much needed conversation starter. Learning about our past will help for a better future. We had the most lovely tour guide who pointed \u2026",
          "Excellent spot! Outstanding visuals and displays.. everyone who visits Winnipeg should go here.. really moving..",
          "Very interesting place. I learned a lot from here about many human rights issues. The whole building is very uniquely deaigned too.",
          "Amazing museum that everyone should visit.   Fantastic architecture,  great exhibits that create conversations.",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong, the building itself is amazing. It is truly a work of art architecturally. However as a student of history the content is seriously lacking any critical thought. Mostly everything in there reads like a fifteen year old\u2019s \u2026",
          "Amazing building.  Would reccomend a visit for  the architecture alone.",
          "Moving and inspiring. It really makes you think about some of the atrocities in this world and some of the good. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "An excellent museum with displays on human rights.",
          "Beautiful building. Lots of money spent there. Tax payer money?  Well done displays and info but it is \u201chuman rights lite\u201d imho. Not too much more than what I\u2019ve read by following news and current events. And the entrance fee would in my \u2026",
          "Tonight I had the opportunity to finally go visit the Canadian museum for Human Rights. It was quite the eye-opening experience. The building itself is impressive! Equally impressive is the story of Human Rights it paints over the course of a hundred or so years. If you're ever in Winnipeg it's a must-see!",
          "A fantastic experience! I have been here 3 times and I'm already planning my next visit. If you are Inuit, Metis or Aboriginal you get in free.",
          "We had the best tour by Savannah..\nMade our visit so worth it.",
          "Beautiful and educational museum! Very thorough information and very kind employees. They even had complimentary coat check!",
          "Huge museum, and to get the best use of your visit you have to have hours to set aside. This will take you multiple times to fully do and see everything, the building is absolutely beautiful and still quiet updated and fresh looking. The \u2026",
          "Welcome to the only museum solely devoted to human rights. Dignity, respect and inclusion matter to us all.",
          "The architecture and design of this museum was breathtaking and the stories told were done in an amazing fashion.",
          "Museum is great, but they can kind of nickel and dime you at the restaurant/gift shop.",
          "It is very good location museum for visiting.",
          "I've travelled all over the world, Australia, all over Asia and Europe. \nBut this museum has to be the most interactive, inclusive and modern on I've ever seen.\nIt's a must see if your in Winnipeg.",
          "Was an awesome time! Lots of history",
          "We went to the museum on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't very busy, yet the front desk people although polite were not very into explaining how we could improve our experience. \nWe didn't know if we should get audio guides or not, if they \u2026",
          "Exciting excibition in an amazing new building.  An absolute must see!",
          "This is one of the two or three most spectacular museum buildings in North America, surpassing any museum on the US east coast. Many museums designed by starchitects have interesting facades (e.g., the Guggenheim), but most often they fall \u2026",
          "One of my favorite museums in the entire world.",
          "Very interesting. Learned lots!",
          "Totally amazing facility. Well worth it. Staff were amazing.",
          "The public discourse was educative and well delivered. Hope to attend similar programs",
          "Went here for a jazz festival event, the event was great with live music in such a beautifully artistic environment was wonderful.\n\nThe museum content was very interactive, and educational, yet very sad and disturbing, that humanity is capable of such sad acts. I learn something new each time I go, I will be going again.",
          "Beautiful architecture. Seeing The building alone is worth the price of admission.  The displays and exhibits are mostly electronic. I was expecting to see more artifacts and historical pieces. The museum\u2019s strategy is that they collect \u2026",
          "Great place for a wedding.  The servers were polite and attentative.  Food was very good.  Very well organized.",
          "Feels like I just read a bunch of Wikipedia articles.",
          "Exceptional architecture in the building construction. Need lots of time to explore and take in the gravity of the exhibits. One or two visits won't give you enough time to take it all in. Consider an annual membership & come back often.",
          "Amazing building. Apparently $365 million in 2014. The exhibits deal with human rights travesties and sadly, Canada is not exempt from man's inhumanity to man. The Nelson Mandela exhibit is on display until 2019/08/25 and causes one to \u2026",
          "This place is amazing. One of the best things winnipeg has to offer. The exhibits are detailed and the include lots of details and history. The building itself is also amazing. The layout is easy to follow even though there\u2019s quite a bit of walking to do. Give yourself few hours when you visit. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "Very well kept and beautiful displays. Can\u2019t wait to come back and experience everything I missed in a limited timeframe.",
          "So impressed. Great Mandela exhibit.  A good balance of world issues and Canadian issues.  Architecture was amazing!",
          "You need a couple of visits to be able to take it all in. So much information on all walks of life....except Irish's history in this world. Because of that I should only give it 3 stars, but in all honesty, you are doing yourself an injustice by not checking it out!",
          "We went there for the Friday Night event. I had no idea this place was going to take so much time or i would have went earlier. A lot of literature to read and digest along with videos etc. If im ever back in Winnipeg i will go back and pick up where i left off.",
          "Excellent museum. Give yourself at least 3 hours to fully explore.  Wear comfy shoes.",
          "This place is not for entertainment. This place is for memory and sorrow. It should never happen again.",
          "Okay place.. Neat architecture but lots of useless spaces.....",
          "If you're in Winnipeg this is a must see! Even if you are not a fan of museums this buildings design is incredible. Exhibits use technology well to cover a variety of topics in both English and French. It is rather Canada focused at times, \u2026",
          "Incredibly informative. At the time of visit, they had the Nelson Mandela exhibit going on with the regular exhibit. When exploring the regular exhibit, be prepared for a loooong walk on an upward incline. They have plenty of rest stops \u2026",
          "Very attractive architecture. Excellent way of presenting a difficult subject. Informative.",
          "Great atmosphere. Nice place.",
          "Great, wonderful Human Rights Museum if you are in Winnipeg its a must visit place. Its world's largest Human Rights Museum located at the wonderful place\"The Forks\" where two rivers meet",
          "Found it rather boring and pretentious. The best parts of the exhibit were only on one floor. I expected more out of this whole thing, honestly.",
          "Amazing museum. The stories it tells are important, thought-provoking, and deeply challenging. Anyone who comes to Winnipeg needs to go",
          "This museum is fantastic. I am not really a museum-person and probably wouldn't have come here, but for the fact that we had a gala event here and could tour the museum for free one hour before our event. Boy, was that misguided! The museum \u2026",
          "This place is literally the best museum on this planet. Everything makes me feel so inspired to do better and to stand up for others rights and freedoms. This places helps people broaden their minds and open up new perspectives.",
          "Incredible information, an amazing building and space.",
          "I enjoy the architecture as it makes a great postcard for the city but is very selective about what human rights issues it discusses. For example, lots of information on the Jewish holocaust and the indigenous residential schools but will \u2026",
          "Large space with very little actual exhibitions to see. Great architecture but the majority of the activities and information from the museum could be found online. All the interactive activities felt like something one could Google. Worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Very cool space, lots of exhibits. Gonna take a few visits to see it all.",
          "Excellent interactive exhibits that share the journey of Human Rights in Canada and around the world. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It was wonderful to visit this place. I have learned a lot aspect from here. A lot of historical story, how people fight to get their right and our right today. Ticket price is CAD 21 + CAD5 for the guide. Tour guide speaks very well and \u2026",
          "One of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Truly.",
          "I liked it but out of our party of 4....I was the only one.  The building design alone wad worth the trip.",
          "A must see for tourists and Winnipegers. Allow yourself 2 visits over a few days. Trying to see it in one day over maybe 4 hours is tuff to do. It is very emotional and thought provoking. \nThe Nelson Mandela exhibit on right now is very good.",
          "This is a great museum sharing so much history in a beautiful way.  I really liked the Nelson Mandela exhibit and not to mention, the building is stunning. Someone was setting up for a wedding when I visited too.",
          "A visit here is one reason alone to go to Winnipeg. Will definitely return, you could spend days taking it all in. It must have been a massive undertaking not only to build but to compile and organize all information and build exhibits. \u2026",
          "Extremely interesting. Visited during the Nelson Mandela exhibit. Very powerful & highly recommended.",
          "What an architectural building... Great displays and information.  Love the stone garden area to sit and reflect on all you have learned.",
          "The Canadian Museum of Human Rights is a great museums to visit. It's actually rather depressing such that Winnipegers joke that it should be renamed to \"The Museum of Human Rights Violations\", but it does do a great job at highlighting \u2026",
          "An amazing building. Staff and volunteer were very informative and helpful.  The Mandela information was well done.",
          "This was one a very different type of museum compared to other typical museums you visit. They look at history with focus on the events that resulted in advances in human rights in the world. The leaders who made sacrifices to push this \u2026",
          "Not only the architecture of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is impressive, the exhibitions are inspiring as well. Especially the stories about Nelson Mandela, the Rohingya and Canada's own struggles with residential schools are very moving. This museum reminds us to take a stand for Human Rights.",
          "Missed some info in timeline but displays were exceptional....be ready for hurt.",
          "Tour guides are told not to influence our thoughts on the exhibits so we basically paid for information about the architecture. The Museum is basically just images with very few items. Interesting but not worth the price tag. I feel like the same fun could be had by reading human rights articles from home.",
          "Beautiful, thought provoking museum.  We have visited many times to enjoy the architecture and the exhibits.   This rating would be 5 stars, however the staff was rude when asked about photography, and could barely give us the time of day, which personally I think is horrible for a museum of this nature.",
          "Beautiful Museum, staff very friendly.",
          "Very interesting. Highly recommend.",
          "An architectual marvel in its own right, you'll need at least 3 hours to see it. It shows mankind at their best, and worst (it gets pretty intense up on level 5). Staff was very friendly and helpful, I left very Impressed.",
          "It's not the most exciting museum but the Mandela display was very well done, and they did a good job of engaging you in the history of apartheid. However, the architecture on the inside is very beautiful with many sitting areas, otherwise you can expect to spend a lot of time reading",
          "Highly recommend for a spare few hours in town. Right beside the forks for lunch as well, very good location!",
          "Lots to see and a very good learning experience!",
          "The museum blew me away. The architecture was amazing and the displays were thought provoking and moving. The view from the tower of peace was incredible. Could spend hours there. The gift shop is worth visiting",
          "It was an amazing experience! If you are in Winnipeg, you need to come visit the museum. Would recommend to everyone.",
          "If you need to know history and see it repeated...come here. Amazing work...",
          "So much to see and learn!!! The Mandela Exhibit was so moving. Everyone should visit this amazing place.",
          "A lot of the history shared is deeply moving and troubling. It truly speaks volumes to the wickedness of humans in the past and even today. The architectural concept is a marvel! This is certainly a must stop if you\u2019re visiting Winnipeg.",
          "A wonderful place to learn and reflect.",
          "Between the intense, dark room giving a history of the Holocaust, an exhibit on Canadian First Nations culture and reconciliation and many others, there are nice gardens and terraces to sit in to think about everything that you've learned so far.",
          "I would highly recommend this to anyone. They have highly engaging exhibits about various human rights struggles throughout the ages. One thing to note, it may be wise to plan to do multiple trips, as there is a lot to get through and you may not be equipped to do it all in one sitting.",
          "View of St Boniface Cathedral from the tower...very appropriate...",
          "A very interesting, informative, and moving experience. There are so many struggles documented in this place that it is almost overwhelming. The exhibits are very well done. My visit exceeded my expectations.",
          "It was a great experience\nI liked it a lot",
          "Love this museum. Stunning building. Friendly and helpful staff. One afternoon gave me time to visit just 4 of 7 floors and read very little of the documentation available in each gallery.\n\nThe tragedy of suffering which is the basis of so \u2026",
          "So happy I finally made it to see CMHR.  I recommend planning 4-5 hours to take it all in.  I went by myself which I also would recommend.  It can be a very powerful experience.",
          "What a colossal waste of time and money. Certainly not what I had expected. Don't waste your money here. It's not what you'd expect.",
          "So educational and inspiring. The architecture is another thing that is a must see inside the building. You will need at least a full day to see everything in the museum.",
          "Constantly update what they are showcasing, architecture is simply breathtaking as you climb higher. Good price, well worth the visit and you would have definitely learned something by the time you leave. If you take a couple people with \u2026",
          "Lots of knowledge of history, great art and awesome building. I could be there the whole day and need to go back a second day. There is so much to see.",
          "This place was awesome. Very interesting and easy to understand. It is very easy to spend the day here",
          "Fantastic museum but very limited hours of operation. Private events take precedence over public enjoyment. Plan on spending your entire afternoon as there is much to see.",
          "Loved this Museum!\nGives a lot of information about people from all over the world. Native Canadians, Holocost, and has one main focus every few months that it may not always have. Beautiful museum, and more important, the people in the \u2026",
          "This was the most inspiring museum we have ever visited..",
          "Very interesting place to visit.  Make sure to go to the very top floor before you leave for a good view of the city and River.",
          "Outstanding visit. The museum was wonderful and the architecture was astounding.",
          "absolutely beautiful, fantastic and inspiring to make a better world for all people!  Human rights should be a top priority!",
          "Truly a world-class museum. It\u2019s a lot to take in, but the meandering glowing walkways and various rest areas offer time to digest and reflect on it all. In the end, you feel hopeful and depressed at the same time, and committed to making things better.",
          "a memorable experience, in an environment that allowed reflexion, the inlay of light in alabaster wall along walkway was awesome. Stunning. Inspired me to learn more of the history on human rights and to be more conscious of how we as individuals can have an impact",
          "Fun for the whole family, reminder don't forget to pay parking",
          "Was in town for work and decided to be a tourist for the day. Museum was beautiful and informative. The Israel tower provided a fantastic view of the city and its a close walk to the forks, which was also very scenic!",
          "Honestly,  everyone needs to visit this Museum. Learned so much. The whole experience is emotional and engaging. You really reflect on things and hold hope for others",
          "Biggest waste of money Winnipeg has spent. I'm all for human rights but the massive amount of money, pomp and showing off that went into this place is ridiculous. Not to mention the ugly architecture. It looks like a 5 year old designed the blueprint of the building.",
          "Not the regular Museum you're used to. CMHR is an information Museum rather than an artifacts collection. Literally hundreds of thousands of hours of information on Human Rights are available and disposed there. It's an incredible \u2026",
          "I thought the displays were fine (but limited selection), however... admission is way over-priced for what you get, there is little to no seating throughout the long walking journey, and no water anywhere (not even drinking fountains) so \u2026",
          "Awesome.  You will need some time to go though but well worth the time if you are interested in human rights .",
          "Very humbling, informative but more importantly stresses the constant mistreatment of people all over the world. We have come a long way but other nations are struggling to get startred. Can only hope that others can have peace and fair rights that we all deserve!",
          "Powerful experience that will stay with me for a long time.",
          "Moving experience. Amazing building, lots of ramps. Go all the way to the top. The location is great",
          "If you are in Winnipeg it's definitely worth it to give it a look. Otherwise I wouldn't travel there just to see it. I would say there is a luck of real ancient artefact that would enhance the experience other than just reading or watching history",
          "Amazing museum!!! Went to it expecting only to spend a couple hours there and nearly 4.5 hours later my girlfriend and I were walking out with a new sobering appreciation of history and the atrocities of mankind, the efforts of those trying \u2026",
          "Great place. Friendly staff and attentive. Everytime I walk through there is something new I see. Very impressive..",
          "Very interesting - has lots of information in the struggles of citizens of Canada as well as the world. The current Mandela exhibit is also very informative.",
          "Stunning architecture, thoughtful content. The marble walks to higher levels are great. Content is diverse but a bit shallow, some aspects deserved more in-depth coverage. Interactive displays are well done, designed for children. Tower of hope offers a view of the surrounding area of the Forks and Winnipeg.",
          "Really cool exhibits, they have a heat tracking circle that has a really wholesome meaning and is interactive",
          "Incredible place! Great architecture - some controversial framing if issues but overall a good educational experience.",
          "Amazing just the building we saw the Nelson Mandela exhibit very good only downfall is parking",
          "Wow. That pretty well describes this place. Growing up in Ottowa I've been to a ton of museums and this one blew me away. At first I was very ashamed of being a Canadian because we have a lot of history that were not taught that we should \u2026",
          "The building is amazing!  The alabaster ramps through the middle of the building are gorgeous. The museum is definitely comprehensive; however I wouldn't recommend staying for more than a couple of hours because the information you \u2026",
          "Had the opportunity to visit the museum on a day off while in town. The building itself is stunning inside and out. The architects really outdid themselves when creating this building. The staff we're very friendly and helpful and were \u2026",
          "Really impressive building, interesting exhibit, expect to spend several hours here. Definitely recommend this museum.",
          "This is an amazing, got to see Museum. Everything is good about it. The first thing we saw was an excellent display on Nelson Mandela and Apartheid - amazing facts. The main museum starts off with definitions of Human Rights, how it evolved \u2026",
          "I strongly believe all Canadians should visit this museum. Amazing interactive exhibits, powerful messages of acceptance of diversity and beautiful displays.",
          "This place would be well worth visiting even if only to see the building. Possibly the most impressive modern architecture in the country. The exhibits don't seem as vast as you would expect in such a massive building but much of the \u2026",
          "I can't believe this Summer was my first time there!! Amazing facility and hey.. I learned something new! (If you can believe that) ;)",
          "Great place.",
          "I spent most of my time in the Mandela exhibition but I liked this place overall.",
          "Love the history and the information was amazing. Would recommend.",
          "Was ok.  To really get more (and you could get a lot) from there, you'd need to take lots of time and do lots of reading in there.",
          "I was interested in going due to the fact the subject is important but the rates that they are charging is for me excessive entrance fees are over $25 per person I just find that excessive.\n\nThe building itself is impressive",
          "Fantastic architecture. The exhibits are sobering and extremely well thought out. Been twice now, one un-guided tour and another with a guide. I enjoyed the guided tour more than I thought as they mentioned much more about the building and the exhibits than I thought there would be.",
          "Took my 9 and 7 and 2.5 year old grandkids. We all had a marvellous time - a full 4 hours of fun and interesting things to see. Went again more recently with the older two. Museum has a booklet of activities for kids this age which worked \u2026",
          "The museum structurally is quite magnificent. I walked to the top and I felt like I got a great workout! The displays however were very lack luster. I felt like it was missing real artifacts to look at. It was primarily just reading. Don't \u2026",
          "This was important for us as parents to take our children here along our travels across Canada. It was harder than I thought it would be to see how history within Canada and the rest of the world. TarvesTravels family was amazed by the architectual aspect as well.",
          "Was there attending an event (AWS tech ) at the main floor lecture room.  Very good facilities,  for a pretty big group.  The event provides appetizers all very tasty,  not sure if the  cooking crews being bought in by event host or from the museum.",
          "Interesting architecture and a great view of the city house some moving exhibits.",
          "Ill be back it is very interesting!!",
          "Is amazing to have this place on Earth to remember what's wrong and what is good.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. Location is fantastic. The Mandela exhibit was very powerful.",
          "Need lots of time to go thru and read everything, more then 1/2 day",
          "Overall, I wouldn't pay $21 again, I would only go on a Wednesday night and pay the $5.  There is very little signage which was frustrating, they need those \"ikea\" arrows on the floor.  The Mandela exhibit made up for disappointing main \u2026",
          "A must see location when in Winning.\nBe prepared to learn what isn't taught in Canadian schools. \nTragic part of Canadian history\nLeft wondering why we have no Indigenous individuals on our money.\nSadly not enough respect for those individuals in our society.",
          "We learn a lot about human rigth there. Nice place to visit when you are in Winnipeg",
          "Stunning architecture housing heartbreaking and beautiful stories of oppression, loss, and overcoming.",
          "A great place to go if you like the history of the human rights or if you would like to get to know it.",
          "An absolute must see museum. .would definitely return again with more time to see all the exhibits. .",
          "The Museum is an architectural master piece. The internal and external views are breathtaking! You have touching stories of human rights concerns across the world well documented in videos and pictures.",

          "Powerful museum, you need time for this as well good legs, the architecture of this building is spectacular, lots of walk way ramps and landings, go to the top of the Hope Tower. Highly recommended",
          "A breathtaking experience. I went there on a early day in june. Its a great place to learn and relive parts of history, its also a great time for anyone who wants a quite walk, early morning. Would recommend it to anyone who goes. Great experience!",

          "I\u2019ve visited several times, this place is unlike any museum I\u2019ve been to. Gorgeous architecture by famed architect Antoine Predock, and incredibly moving exhibits of human rights violations and celebrations.",
          "Amazing museum with so much information for you to learn. An incredible pice of architectural ingenuity! If you want to be able to see and read everything you want make sure you set a day to do so. Highly recommend!",

          "Outstanding museum to visit. You need more than one day.",
          "Amazing museum with refreshing exhibit on Nelson Mandela. Employees went out of their way to say \"Hi\" and to make helpful suggestions on museum and other attractions in the area. Went primarily for Mandela exhibit and spent close to 3 hours \u2026",
          "Rightfully so, this place is HUGE with quite a story to tell. The guides there are very courteous and willing to answer any questions that you have -- you can tell that  they genuinely want you to enjoy your visit.\n-If you are concerned \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful, modern, interactive, and unique museum. I wish I could have spent all day here. I highly recommend visiting! Well worth the price of admission. I would also recommend going on a guided tour.",
          "Wonderful exhibits. Food for thought, especially with current politicians.\ud83d\ude41",
          "I feel bored. Sorry, but its what i feel.",
          "Give yourself several hours to experience this museum. It is both beautiful and moving, thought-provoking and inspiring.",
          "Such a great place. I could have spent an entire day here and wish I had more time. We did the guided tour for only $5 more each. Great deal. I hope to return if I'm ever in Winnipeg again.",
          "Very beautiful place, layout was nice and the alabaster ramps were impressive, but I could not shake the feeling of money wasted on unnecessary extravagances through the museum. I also agreed that some of the content was lacking with plenty \u2026",
          "If you love learning about past and present social issues, this is an amazing place to visit. Thought was put into every detail, including the incredible architecture. Be prepare for a workout! This place is huge and has multiple levels. If \u2026",
          "Typical political correct rewriting of real history. It's sad to read history rewritten to please one group or another... i would prefer to read or see the truth and learn from it. Not be told how i should see history that's been distorted \u2026",
          "Nice museum with lots of meaningful info. Very big too.",
          "It looks really nice on the inside, feel like there is a lot of wasted space though. Lots of history and knowledge in here.",
          "Very nice place, interesting information",
          "Spent about 3 hours at the museum. Was amazed at the architecture and curation - the overall scope and weight of the museum is awe inspiring. Found at times the layout a bit hard to navigate but lots of friendly staff available to assist.  A must see for all.",
          "Here's a tip, extended hours during the summer/weekends...revolutionary.",

          "Marvelous architecture inside and outside. The exhibits are interesting and informative. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Amazing value for $10 admission price. Must-see.",
          "Great exhibits, really thought provoking. Architecture somehow accentuates the depth of the subject matter.",
          "It's worth going for the architecture and overall message. Many of the exhibits mainly  consist of writing on the walls. Everything takes a Canadian perspective which I found interesting.",
          "Amazing architecture, a bit light on content but worth it for the building alone",
          "Can't rate. This comes up because I searched it and am contemplating walking there and chaining myself to a railing. I'm Hostage and have no Civil or Human Rights,  treated as a \"non person\", in a First World Country.  Check out  few videos if they can be accessed on you tube : \"Hostage CanadianAndy.\" The struggle is very real.",
          "Learn from the past and act for the future.",
          "An Incredible \"thought provoking\" Museum.\nThis Museum, one of only two National museums located outside the National Capital Region, focuses on many aspects of Human Rights issues-- not only in the \"Canadian setting\" but also \u2026",
          "It was fun, has a good View",
          "This was my 1st time there. Nelson Mandela event was great. Staff was kind and took me over 6 hours to go through the whole museum but there is a lot more in exhibitions to see. I will definitely visit again.",
          "I can speak only on the appearance of the building, the parking, and the general level of interest I had in doing the exhibits inside. I\u2019ve visited this organization for business and not for enlightenment so I did not have the chance to \u2026",
          "A cool building with interesting facts and games that help with learning. The price is fairly reasonable if you are planning on staying for everything, otherwise it can seem pricey for groups.",
          "Amazing building, I love the view from the top. The exhibits are fascinating but unless you're prepared to do a lot of reading you might be a little disappointed; it doesn't have a whole lot of actual artifacts.",
          "Amazing and sobering. Very interesting. You should go.",
          "August 11, 2018 - Not sure what happened to my post of June 23 of my last visit to CMHR. I went to Museum again today to experience some of the exhibits before they move to next city. \n\nPlease take your time and visit this beautiful museum \u2026",
          "Plan for multiple days. So much to  take in.",
          "Very moving. Wonderful museum.",
          "Amazing. Perhaps one of the best museums in the world and an absolute must see for all Canadians.",
          "Loved this. Be prepared for an emotional walk through history. A lot of walking. Displays are thought provoking and really well done! The building is as stunning as it is large. Wear good shoes!",
          "Great experience! We would highly recommend it. We were there for almost 4 hours.",
          "Very informative and displays are accessible and well thought out.",
          "This was my first time at the museum, and it was incredible! Everything was put together so well, and I'd never seen anything like it. I can't wait to visit again to see what I didn't have time to see my first visit, and would recommend to everyone to visit.",
          "One of the most interesting, well organized, thought out, and visual pleasing, informative, curated, current info. It compels you to want to revisit as it is impossible to view and read everything presented. Must be revisited to capture and \u2026",
          "So much to see and learn. We need to go back",
          "Amazing architecture, and good history. A must stop if you are in town.",

          "Very cool but very sad what people are capable of",
          "A great quirky looking building that houses an incredibly moving collection of items that chronicle the global effort of creating, instilling and upholding human rights. It also showcases the tragedy and the state of situations where and \u2026",
          "Amazing. Allow yourself ample time or plan on going twice.",
          "Amazing building, exhibits very well done, especially the ones about some of Canada's embarrassing history. Go. Learn.",
          "This museum was fantastic. The museum itself is huge. There's so much to see and do. I'd recommend putting aside quite a bit of time. To get through all the floors it will take at least 4 hours, but probably more. Less if you rush through \u2026",
          "Very beautiful structure.",
          "Incredible museum. I've been there three times now and every time I see and learn new things. Important parts of history that must not be forgotten.  Large number of interactive exhibits and the content can be adapted to just about any age \u2026",
          "This is a world class museum! I went for a nearly 6 hour tour(including the Mandela exhibit) and I still had to skim through many areas in order to experience the whole building. Bring comfortable footwear. Also, prepare to be informed of \u2026",
          "Amazing. Plan a full day as I went on an 1.5 hour guided tour and there wasn't enough time. Will go again next time I'm in Winnipeg",
          "Pretty interesting place to get to know about human rights across the world",
          "This museum is an extremely multisensual experience. There is so much to see and so much that gets captured in ways beyond pictures and signs. Give yourself lots of time to take in the sights, and don't expect to get through the whole thing in one visit",
          "Have been here twice now, and have done the guided tour each time (would for sure recommend that). The building has so many subtle additions to the design that hint at culture and history I would not have caught or understood otherwise. \u2026",
          "It is a very well done exhibit of human rights activists and issues around the world, current and historic.",
          "Super happy that we finally, after four years of coming to Winnipeg for soccer, had an opportunity to visit the human rights museum. It was full of touching, soul wrenching and uplifting exhibits in  such a beautiful facility.",
          "Bad design for people with mobility issues.  Only one elevator goes from the bottom to the top making one overflow with people and the other empty.",
          "Well worth the visit. For both the content and the architecture.",
          "An amazing and touching learning experience. Learned a lot on history and how far human beings have come in making today happen. \nThank you to all the past, present and future human beings who keep this world a sane place :)",
          "Wonderful experience!   This was my first time walking through the CMHR and it won't be my last.  There were so many exhibits I missed and did not get my immediate attention, and I plan to go again.",
          "Thought provoking displays and spectacular architecture!",
          "Overall this is an amazing institution. The architecture is stunning. And the vast amount of topics covered is astounding. I did not know what to expect - but it turns out humans rights is relatated to numerous topics.",
          "I loved everything about this place and I'll definitely be back!",
          "While the museum is fascinating and an architectural achievement, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by the content of the exhibits. The tour guide I had was friendly and gave us plenty of information on the architecture. \n\nNot the best \u2026",
          "Enjoyed the day with my family. Complementary wheelchairs and very knowledgeable staff.",
          "This is an amazing though overwhelming museum. Prepare to be heartbroken.",
          "Very interesting exhibits - loved the Nelson Mandela section. Heart-breaking permanent exhibits. There could have been more packed into the space - maybe the experience early blacks had in Canada? The bistro on-site was super - fast and big portions!",
          "Amazing architecture and displays that tell the history of the development of human rights around the world. I went to a very informative presentation on Iran and the abuses of human rights especially in regards to the Baha'i Faith.",
          "Incredible view and architecture, not much to do inside.",
          "World and I meann World class museum. Great displays with lots of interactive items. Currently showing special exhibit on Mandela and it is outstanding. \n\nArchitecture of the building is as impressive as the exhibits. Can easily spend 2-3 hrs here if you like.",
          "This Museum was absolutely amazing. As someone who grew up in canada is was extremely interesting and informative. I would suggest that every candida. Citizen visit this beautiful building and watch as many videos as possible. It gives \u2026",
          "An absolute must see for everyone, not just those in Winnipeg. Make this a destination! We spent 3 hours here and it wasn\u2019t enough. Nelson Mandela exhibit was amazing. Had a staff member tell us he remembered exactly where he was when \u2026",
          "It's good to come soon as the museum opens in the morning at 9:45 and take your time throughout the day. You are allowed to leave at lunch and come back if you want with the same ticket. There are volunteers who greet you at the door and \u2026",
          "because its cool",
          "It's a beautiful piece of architecture. I'm not really one for museums. It's great if you love history. I found it ok but have no great desire to go back.\nTip: keep going until you hit the top. You will be rewarded with a great view.\nRamps make it easy to get around if you are in a wheelchair.",
          "So much to see. I think u will benefit if you have a tour guide. It will help you understand and digest some of the stories.",
          "An architectural marvel of shape, texture and medium.  The museum makes you reflect on the advancement of human rights with time, visual media and informative descriptions of historical events.",
          "Very honest look at painful Canadian human rights. Looking at improving.",
          "Beautiful building, thought provoking content. We spent 4 hours there; took the galleries tour with Nick who was wonderful and very engaging, gave us very in depth explanation on a fraction of the exhibits (not a comparing at all!), we \u2026",
          "This museum is really a must-see for anyone while in Winnipeg. From the outside it is spectacular, and on the inside it is just as beautiful. The tour guides are very friendly and knowledgeable, and the exhibits are fascinating with both \u2026",
          "The Nelson Mandela  exhibit  is a great addition to  the museum",
          "Lots to see. Loads of history of you like that kinda thing. Good view from the top.",

          "Arrived 1.5 hours prior to closing, staff didn't bother to note that we would need more time to see everything. We skipped over quite a few exhibits (which were mostly just text and a few sparse videos and interactive displays) and still \u2026",
          "One of the best museums I've been, architecture is amazing and even has a view of the city.",
          "Museum is massive with very little content. Human rights do not physically exist therefore cannot be physically displayed. All exhibits  simply discuss human rights or portray someone's struggle to achieve them. I was very disappointed \u2026",
          "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is an incredible and inspiring museum to visit and explore in Winnipeg. \n\nThe museum is large and has eight levels featuring a variety of exhibits about the history of human rights violations and \u2026",
          "I had a great experience at the Canadian Museum for Humanity. I had some flashback with certain scenes due to the fact that I was following those events very closely at that time. Great help with the staff!",
          "Comparable to the great international museums!",
          "This place is absolutely amazing! The information is awesome and provided in abundance. But my favorite part of this experience was the architecture. The building is incredibly gorgeous inside and out. (see pictures below). I highly, highly recommend you visit this museum!",
          "It\u2019s free every first Wednesday of the week!",
          "Very interesting informative and interactive. Plan for a big chunk of time if you want to visit all the areas.",
          "Very interesting exhibitions and cool view from the top",

          "What an amazing building. A must see when exploring winnipeg",
          "Fantastic architecture and some of the best arranged exhibit spaces I've seen in a museum. Despite housing 6 floors of displays and an observation deck atop the beacon of hope, the entire museum can be enjoyed in just a few hours.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "One of the most interesting museums in Winnipeg and an architectural gem. Right now the Mandela exhibit is open and well worth a visit; to see and digest this properly takes a good couple of hours; then there is the rest of the building to \u2026",
          "One of the most interesting museums I've seen in all of Canada. 7 floors of human right history. Winnipeg must-see attraction. The architecture of the building is impressive",
          "Gorgeous museum! The architect and structure of the building are truly mine blowing. You can be almost at the top and see right through all the floors to the bottom but have no clue that was possible while you were at the bottom. Filled \u2026",
          "It was an incredible experience especially going as a group. I have been here before but the experience is unique. The inspiration is beyond words and more importantly, the opportunity to contribute to it by writing your thoughts or ideas regarding keywords like Love and what you want to fight for.",
          "Great place! We could've spent the day there. I learned a lot \ud83d\ude0d",
          "This was a great museum with amazing architecture. I found many of the displays very well done. My only caveat is that it is very biased, and some that are touted as human rights heroes have actually committed war crimes. This was very \u2026",
          "Human rights is always a good thing.",
          "Great place to know new stuff about Winnipeg",
          "Great exhibits that really make you stop and think. The museum is well put together. I highly recommend doing the building tour. It was phenomenal to hear how much detail was put into everything in the building.",
          "The exhibitions are interesting, interactive and educational. The architecture is extraordinary.",
          "Very cool museum.  There are some things missing but over all it was terrific.  The tower at the end is spectacular",
          "If there go in. Don't forget to ride the elevator. When you do you'll knoe why i said too. If you noticrd nothing check your pulse. You died some time ago and just forgot to fall down",
          "Cool building, very dissapointing exhibits.",
          "It's magnificent! The construction makes you too fell alone and small. The expositions touch you deep. You will have to deal with a bunch of emotions. It's perfect!",
          "Informative, moving and in an incredible building. So many people have done so much to advance the cause of human rights, yet so much left to do. More than Canadian, international yet with a Canadian perspective. Well worth a visit.",
          "Great place but lots of reading to do not really good for small children",
          "Very interesting but I wouldn't go again. Somethings were depressing.",
          "The museum was beautiful, but not the people. One of the security guards grabbed parts of me that shouldn\u2019t have been touched. I knew he done it on purpose because he winked at me after wards. Then the bag check refused to give me back my \u2026",
          "Beautiful building, inside and out. The architecture of the building by itself is worth the visit. I only spend 3 hours in the museum, and I think I  will need at least a full day to see everything there is to see. I found the  exhibits very interesting and well put together. I highly recommend the visit for the whole family!",
          "Absolutely worth heading to if you are in the area. Highly recommend.",
          "Very nice museum. The architecture is what really makes it stand out! However it is a little pricy.",
          "The museum is fantastic, but there is only one panel dedicated to how ordinary people participate in genocide. It's easy to leave learning a lot but never questioning whether you would resist or be complicit in genocide.",
          "It's not the typical museum which I've visited in the past. Lot's interesting exhibits with focuses on local and international events. Definitely something worth while seeing of your in the area.\nIf you're schedule allows, avoid visiting on \u2026",
          "A truly amazing experience. The exhibits compliment the building's absolutely stunning architecture. There are so many things to check out here. A totally worth while place to be.",

          "Powerful and emotional eye opening and inspiring. Nelson Mandela exhibit was more than I knew about him and his fight against apartheid.",
          "Beautiful building with so much to explore and learn. Great resteraunt and gift shop too. So much to take in. Best value is the membersip option that allows multiple visits over the year. Includes free 4 hour parking during your visit.",
          "Needs to be more inclusive and focus on the current issues.",
          "The architecture was amazing",
          "Today, I took the opportunity to visit the CMHR. Here are a couple pointers and tidbits I would like to share.\n- This is not a place to visit for an hour or two. Plan a full day to be able to take everything in.\n- Parking is NOT free. Pay \u2026",
          "We had an amazing experience! The exhibits are very well done - they make you feel like you\u2019re a part of each story/event being told. Go all the way and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a great view of the city as well.",
          "Fun? No  educational?  Amazing!",
          "Unbelievably gorgeous architecture.  8 floors of very unbiased history through human rights.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not to mention everyone there was so polite, I found myself questioning ulterior motives, but then I had to remind myself that I wasn't in the states.",
          "So much to learn from there",
          "Great but the message is depressing.  Unfortunately most that will go there already get it.  Those that need to learn may never go there.  Great message.  I hope many learn from the mistakes of the past.",
          "Great facility with hours of entertainment here. This is a must stop for people coming through Winnipeg, and it's right near the Forks and within walking distance as well. \n\nBeautiful area to grab some food, take a walk and then learn some \u2026",
          "Amazing peice of living human history",
          "What an amazing place to spend a day at, different from what I expected.  The staff exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable.  I did two tours, one basic informational and the other with a Spiritual flavor of the Indigenous peoples.  Both were wonderful experience and I'd recommend both. An absolute must visit!",
          "Love love love.. like many others while this was being built I thought it was a horrendous waste of money. Now having being there probably 7 or 8 times I would highly recommend this to anybody. It is very humbling to go in there and realize \u2026",
          "Some of the installation in the exhibit need to be rethought and changed for interaction with viewers.\nOverall it is an interesting museum that I'm sure will have many different changes over the years. Would like to see some better resources and tours for schools.",
          "Learned stuff",
          "Lots to learn.  Well presented for all ages.  I would have wanted 4 hours instead of 2.  Well worth the cost.  View at the top is spectacular!",
          "Amazing. Wish I had planned more than 2 hours. Plan to spend at least 4. The Nelson Mandela exhibit was fantastic.",
          "The theme of the museum is exceptionally relevant. They expose and discuss Human Rights as a historical event, worldwide agreement, and very importantly as a facet of the Canadian journey. I went with a close friend, and we spent hours \u2026",
          "I wanted EVERYTHING on this brunch menu. Perfect for a Saturday date - a little brunch and a little culture!",
          "It is place to visit and learned.",
          "Great restaurant and gift shop to",
          "Really overwhelmed with some of the exhibits.  Would be nice to use up more of the space...",
          "Climbing up the ramps inside was a struggle, and a great metaphor for our journey toward perfection  as human beings. It was a beautiful and sad journey.",
          "Everything is interesting and the whole place is bilingual, which is awesome. This was by far the best museum I\u2019ve visited.",
          "Leave yourself 3 to 4 hours to see everything.  It's a reminder of where we have been and how far we still have to go in this world to ensure human rights.",
          "A lot to learn here. Very impressive. When you visit the museum be prepared to spend some time.",
          "Learned alot",
          "Amazing experience. Highly suggest the interactive displays especially on the 6th floor and 7th floor. Also the view from the top was amazing.",
          "Amazing place,everyone should visit make sure to give yourself lots of time and not rush. There it's lots of stories that maybe weren't in the public eye but just as important told here.",
          "Is the best place of human rights in the world",
          "A nice place to visit lots of History security are pretty friendly and the staff are helpful",
          "Wow!!!! That's all I can say. What an amazing display of History. Had a short 30-minute private tour but enough to make me want to go back again and again. I cannot imagine how much money has been spent to put this awesome display on for \u2026",
          "An amazing place. Depressing to see how badly we treat each other and inspiring to see others fight to stop the abuse. I thought I'd give myself two hours to view the place. I ran out of time. So much to see and it is a very large building.",
          "The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is an absolute must-see. Learn of historic global moments as you walk through exhibitions, such as Mandela: Struggle for Freedom. The museum offers a variety of informative tours, such as the \u2026",
          "Amazing stories of the struggle for human rights. Staff are very informative on the tour and helpful when exploring on our own - there is always someone to answer questions at each exhibit.",
          "Absolutely incredible! We had a guided tour that was phenomenal but I wish we had more time to just wander the museum on our own. Plan to be there a good five to six hours to get it all.",
          "It was very educational, and it explained information in a very easy and interesting  way. I spend almost 3 hours, but depending on your interest, you can stay there longer. They have lots of information! Building itself was unique as well. I enjoyed it and learned a lot",
          "A great place to increase compassion and see how our actions impact everyone.",
          "Really big and beautiful museum. Very artistic but also very informative. I like how they have the division of certain rights and you ger to walk through the various facets of not only human rights but himan nature. Inalways like a bit more \u2026",
          "Not bad. Was there for a Christmas party. Wasn't allowed to look around because it was closed so we had to stay in one area.",
          "Awesome restaurant.",
          "It's quite the spectacle of a building, it's monstrous design might be for the long walkway to every floor (designed to be like a labyrinth). Spent most of the time walking on the ramp with nothing to look at on the walls that might remind \u2026",
          "Our tax money payed off! Only been there once but it is really nice inside, not too sure about the point on the building it just looks a little unfinished.",
          "This is a great place. Couldn't make it all the way through, as my daughter started crying, reading all the atrocities, especially the story about the Innu. Sure opens up your eyes. The gift shop is also awesome. Something for everyone and every price range. Nice they recognize status cards and allow free entry.",
          "Loved it, I've been here many times and it never gets old. It really opens up people's eyes about humanity.",

          "One of the most breathtaking museums I've ever visited. The architecture and layout is spectacular. The content and engagement with the public is powerfully sobering and inspiring.",
          "An architectural marvel with wonderful nuances to the human rights discussion. One of the best in the world.",
          "We booked the restaurant for a private breakfast meeting.  Thought the food would be amazing, but it was just okay: scrambled eggs, typical hash brown cubes and bacon or sausage.  \nBut the building is beautiful, and an architectural marvel.\nThe servers were lovely and kind.",
          "Amazing place. Only one of it's kind in the whole world. Every city in the world should have one. Until then, everyone in the world should visit this treasure.",
          "A must-see... So relevant for the times. Beautiful spaces inside. Exhibits were education, impactful, and artistically displayed. A good mix of world events and Canadian priorities.",
          "The Canadian Human Rights Museum at the Forks is an exceptional institution.  It is a museum with remarkably few physical objects on display compared to an art gallery or the Manitoba Museum.  The key items are ideas and concepts, with \u2026",
          "Harrowing depictions of the cruelty of humankind and the lengths humans have reached in persecuting others. Beautifully insightful",
          "Biggest waste of money. Should have bought new water treatment plants for northern reserves",
          "How much money did this place cost to build and our vets live on the streets maybe let's help our own before we preach about what other people went through in OTHER countries",
          "Do you really want to get your mind working. This venue is very thought provoking. Go as a group and share your own observations of stories you have heard or witnessed. Made me feel so thankful for all those who have contributed in so many \u2026",
          "Very interesting museum. The permanent expo is very interactive. Amazing architecture. Nice view from the top floor. Took us about 3h30 to visit de museum. I would recommend to anyone who visits Winnipeg.",

          "Modern concept building showing engineering marvels, well laid cultural attractions",
          "Kinda boring one exhibit was just of spoons and spatulas hung by string",
          "Great place to visit. You can get lost in thought and space while visiting. I would recommend scheduling half to a full day to wander and take in everything. Lots of fun and interesting interactive displays.",
          "Breathtaking architecture to reflect on the serious subject matter.",
          "Thought provoking! I was there for 2 1/2 hours, and I only made it to the 4th floor.  So much to see.",
          "Very welcoming and entertaining facility. Extremely inclusive and diverse with the exhibits. The architecture is amazing and the walk through the facility is very satisfying. It is centrally located in Winnipeg. Plenty of parking across the \u2026",
          "Very selective history; they don't want to annoy certain human rights abusers. This museum is a stain on Canada for refusing to point out abuses by certain regimes.",
          "Beautiful building, good to go with family to enjoy the expositions.",
          "Incredible view from the top. Great place to go. Once a month there's a free admission",
          "Always shocking what the Nazi's did to people. The 6th floor was under construction. Bring a phone and some headphones for a guided tour with their app on the play store \"CMHR\" Free wifi but it is a large download and wifi is slow. Going on \u2026",
          "Wow! So happy this place exists.  Mandela exhibit was excellent. Very informative and beautifully designed. Love the rainbow crosswalk.",
          "Really nice place to visit .\nLost of histories",
          "Excellent Mandela Gallery. Was disappointed in the lack of substantial Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada information. Would love to come back in a few years to see what else they have put together.",
          "Great setup for the museum, lots of great content and exhibits to see. Beautiful architecture, must see if in Winnipeg",
          "Pros:\n- The architecture is beautiful and spacious and the layout (essentially walking up in a spiral through the relatively chronological exhibitions) helps encourage reflection on what you\u2019re seeing as it develops. \n- Many \u2026",
          "Quite the experience. Would go again.",

          "The most unexpected part of our visit was a please touch museum with taxidermy animals of the area you can touch. Awesome! There\u2019s a burying owl about to hibernate. There\u2019s a sod house, bison area, wetlands and pond, trials galore.",

          "Fort Whyte is a beautiful nature preserve in the city with lots to offer. After having not visited here since probably a field trip when I was in elementary school, I recently returned to spend a day exploring here. I enjoyed wandering the various trails that led through",

          "Took a tour of this place with a bird guide and then the buffalo guide. Both guides were very knowledgeable and helpful. Had lunch there and sandwiches and soup were delicious. I wish we had longer to walk around. Would like to visit again in the Spring.",
          "This place is about waterfowl of all kinds. Ducks ,Swans and Geese . As it is built on reclaimed marshland there are also many song birds . The trails and board walks lead you around the marshes and on to aspen groves. There are also buffalo in a very large enclosed field.",
          "My family spent the day here, about 5hrs. We really enjoyed the Walking Trails and and Interpretive Center. Our favorite thing was the marsh trail and the floating docks across the various ponds. We saw many birds, ducks, and turtles, too. All the kids had a great time. We had",
          "Seeing how people lived in sod houses and what they had to do just to survive was interesting. Glad I didn't live back then. Buffalo were also entertaining to observe. Restaurant here had amazing food!",
          "Had a great time on the safari with my 6 year old daughter. The guide was very informative and you get quite close to the bison. This is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for years. You book ahead for the safari and it\u2019s an extra fee. The bus is fully enclosed but they don\u2019t usually",
          "Fort Whyte is a nature preserve just a few minutes from the suburb of Charleswood. There are many summer and winter activities promoted through out the year. We attended the Goose Flight dinners last fall. At this time of year there are more geese in Manitoba than people. We had",
          "A nice place for lunch and nature walk and sightings. See the bison, go to the marshes, paddle a canoe, ride a bike, all within city limits. It is nice and quiet but still an outdoor adventure. They have special programs throughout the year such as runs, fires, workshops, a good",
          "But make sure you check their hours. It takes a while to get through all or some of the paths so you don\u2019t want to be rushed.",

          "We were looking for a place to go for a walk when we found Fort Whyte. They have a lot of neat self guided trails with wide paths. We went on a hot sunny day and you do need to bring water and an umbrella for shade if you need it. There are some rest stops along the trails but",

          "I took my grandson this morning to see the buffalo and have a toboggan slide. What a great place. The buffalo were active, the toboggans are provided and the slide is quick, safe and long. He marvelled at the ice fishing and the hot chocolate and banana bread were first rate.",
          "Excellent volunteer guided early morning tour with continental breakfast supplied by on site cafe. About 25 of us showed up for a grey, grim and cold wander to see the various birds now at Fort Whyte. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have binoculars. Loaners are available. There were",
          "We went to Grandmas for Easter weekend and used a family pass for Fort Whyte on Saturday. This was our first time here and it was awesome. We liked everything. Watching the geese as they nest, hoping to see an egg being laid, but we didn\u2019t. Ha the geese just kept making nests",
          "If you like being outdoors in the winter you will love Fort Whyte Alive! Tobogganing, hiking, snowshoeing to name a few of the activities provided. A nice cafe and a terrific gift store with locally produced honey, jams and other tasty morsels.",
          "We went to the centre and were very impressed by the nature trails, the bison, the sod house and the aquarium.",
          "One of my friends suggested lunch here and a walk through the trails and a zip down the toboggan run. It was a nice varied menu I had a great salad with chicken breast and the portion was fantastic and it was fresh and tasty. I sampled the zucchini loaf and it was yummy too!.",
          "Being visitors to Canada we wanted to do something different. Lovely walks and you can see Bison as you arrive. Snow shoes walk, which was great fun ! There is short toboggan run which was a hoot. It looks a great place to take kids as it it is geared up for educational events.",
          "This is one of the biggest wildlife parks located southwest of Winnipeg. It has many enclosures accommodating bison deer and has a nice cafe and gift shop. The gift shop and reception area is next to a lake where the geese take off during the winter migration. You get to see",
          "I have been travelling to Fort Whyte Nature Centre and now Fort Whyte Alive for decades it is a place which never fails to please. It has exhibits a gift shop, caf\u00e9 for light lunches and beverages, it caters for groups, has a real farm and a bison herd as well as prarie",
          "You guys should totally come here during Winter. They have amazing sights to see and we did ride the caravan. It was a great experience!!",
          "Fort Whyte is a wonderful place to experience nature in a protected environment. The experience is not zoo-like, it is authentic. The bison are free to roam but are also protected. Both our birding guide and our bison guide were well informed and pleasant to spend time",
          "View herds of majestic bison from a lookout, hike well-kept, gentle nature trails dotted with historic information, and bounce over a marsh on a floating boardwalk. There's even a big tree-house for the kids. Wear layers, as it can get cold, but a great outdoor attraction!",
          "We attended the FortWhyte Alive for the Goose Flight Feast with another couple. The write up makes it sound great. However, the meal itself and the service was average\u2026nothing spectacular. I've had better meals at other restaurants. The cost is $51.75 plus taxes and",
          "I visited on a weekday when its fairly quiet. I walked the trails a few times to see the bisons and enjoyed a delicious lunch of corn chowder and falafel. Its a beautiful area to wander around and enjoy. I like that there are benches everywhere to sit and enjoy the view if",
          "A large parcel of land with man made lakes for birds and other wildlife, plus a substantial herd of Bison that is part of a network of parks that are about restoring their numbers. There are hundreds of million Bison in the early 1800's that had dwindled to a few thousand by",
          "We had a nice tour of Fort Whyte which included baking bannock over a fire, visiting a recreated sod house, and a tipi to learn how the natives threw spears to hunt the bison. I think we would have been hungry for a long time! The highlight was a tour in a small bus out to the",
          "My wife and I spent a very pleasant day with our daughter and her two young children ( 4 and 2 ) recently at Fort White. lots of interesting things to see and plenty of space to walk and explore. We all lovedit and will return soon.",
          "Fort Whyte Alive is a nature center in Winnipeg. It is used by runners, bikers and cross country skiers (in season). The trails are well maintained, and the Bison herd is pretty cool. They have a nice cafe and a little gift shop. We really enjoyed it and it was well worth",
          "The Bison Safari was horrible. They pack you in tight in a little bus that was very crowded and very hot. They drive out to a little Watering Hole Where the Buffalo are and park for 30 minutes on one side then turn the bus around and park for 30 minutes the other side. Yes it is",
          "We walked all afternoon, experienced, wildlife, fish, ducks in their natural habitat. The walking trails are very well maintained and take from the pond, to the ponds, the various grasses and the birds. We just loved it so much. Will go back for sure.",
          "It is hard to believe that this quiet peaceful and beautiful area is right in the city. If you need to escape the hustle and bustle of the city - this is the place to go.",
          "Great to see the bison up close. For an extra fee, take the small bus out to see the bison. The staff person has lots of hands on materials such as bison teeeth and fur.",
          "Fantastic area for walking, cycling, observing nature. The whole complex has been totally redone from what I remembered. Great place to take the kids. Very reasonably priced at $8 for adults and even less for kids. Ample parking.",
          "Took a group of out of town delegates here to get a \"taste\" of what MB is about. They LOVED the bison safari. Fort Whyte did an awesome job of programming for my group. The safari and bannack over the fire were by far the biggest hits. We would have loved to go out on the river",
          "Knowledgeable and patient guides escorted and demonstrated variety of nature experiences. Pond dipping, watching birds fly in and the room of animal models were all a highlight for our grade one students. I will be taking my grandkids there soon.",
          "Brought my mom here for the Mothers Day brunch (5 stars for that we will be back next year) and then we walked the trails after. Absolutely beautiful. I saw so many birds and a turtle even cross the path infront of us. Just amazing. go sit in nature and enjoy yourself",
          "I had a meeting that was facilitated at Fort Whyte and it was a treat as I forgot what a wonderful facility this is and the ever changing wildlife. A placid wonderful place to visit and experience. The food and service is also excellent",
          "I came here with friends. We had an adult in a wheelchair and found it quite easy to maneuver over the paths. It's a lovely place for a walk, hike, bicycle ride or a picnic. Lots of options on how to spend the day. We didn't see the bison as it was a hot day. We did see ducks,",
          "A really great place to check out. Nice walking/biking trails, tons of interesting information everywhere, a great restaurant and all for next to nothing. Great value for your dollar. Loved the sod house, the swamp and the treehouse..and the food! Will definitely return.",
          "You'd never guess how close you are to the city in this wild spot. What an incredible place to feel lost in nature and surrounded by wildlife. We saw bison, prairie dogs, pelicans and more while we wandered the grounds.",
          "Went there for picnic on a sunny April day. The air there was fresh and weather was fantastic. We brought our picnic backpack with coffee, juice, sandwich and fruits. We found a prime spot to sit down to enjoy our sandwiches and coffee. Could see & hear the sounds of Canadian",
          "I like to ride my bike along the various trails in this area. There is teepees, a sod house, birds galore and a few lakes. The bison are often viewable from a hill not too far from the parking lot. Nice place to just chill out or maybe a picnic or a walk. It\u2019s like being in",
          "This wonderful combination of small lakes (with canoeing, kayaking and sailing), prairie (with bison herds, prairie dogs, gophers and raptors), ski trails (having known the Stewart family decades ago, the memorial trial dedicated to their son Paget is a worthy testimony to his",
          "I did not know that this oasis existed in our province. We especially enjoyed watching the ground hogs this Spring. Check it out!",
          "The Paget Stewart memorial ski trail next to the bison enclosure is a beautiful stretch of tracked trail.",

          "Took visiting kids ages 7 and 10 there for the afternoon. They enjoyed all things there but especially the sod house and the toboggan slide. Nice to have the toboggans supplied and really a fun slide when they went so far out onto the ice. Snow shoeing was also good but need",

          "we went for a walk around this amazing place and loved the history behind it all. Also we got to see how they use to build house in the old days I believe its called Sod House.",
          "We chose to do some hiking on our last day in Manitoba. The main building is under construction as is their cafe. We enjoyed seeing all the animals in the Nature center before setting out on our hike. There are more activities fir the summer, but winter hiking was fine for us.",
          "One of the few places you\u2019ll get to see bison & get a history of the indigenous people of Manitoba. A fun trip with an informative & pleasant guide. The restaurant is nothing flash, so don\u2019t expect a gourmet meal here.",

          "This place is great and who knew it's pretty much in the heart of the city?! You don't have to travel far to see bison, prarie dogs and owls. Visit year round as the have activities all the time. Getting an annual membership is recommended. The cafe has stellar scratch made",
          "Had a great time with the grandkids. They loved seeing all the wildlife, got really close to a mom and baby deer. The ducks and geese were all over. They really liked in the resourse centre being able to touch all the animal fur. The bison were all sitting down in the far field",
          "Covering a square mile, this park offers many various opportunities to see the historic \"natural side\" of Winnipeg;s environs!! What was an abandoned mine now houses water features, buffaloes, geese and extensive picnic facilities!! Its really worthy of a visit!!!",
          "We had been wanting to do the bison safari at Ft Whyte for a while now Nd finally just booked! Our driver and guide Emilie was very knowledgeable and we learnt a lot about Bison today! It was incredible seeing the large animals so up close and the best part is standing at the",
          "Cycled there with friends today. No admission fees if you go by bike. Really enjoyed seeing the bison herd. Nice walking trails and informative signage. There is a cafe onsite, but we didn't try it. Definitely recommend for a couple of hours.",

          "It was a lovely nature park with nice walking trails, and lots of opportunity to see local wildlife. The only downside for us was the inside prairie dog area (seems strange to need this, when there are free roaming ones outside) and the protection of the bison, when the male",
          "Fort Whyte is a beautiful animal conservation site in winnipeg. Its a little off the beaten path (just barely outside the city) the landscape and the wildlife is worth the drive. There are no bus routes to this area of the city so you will need a car to get to Fort Whyte.",
          "We have had a family membership at Fort Whyte Alive for many years and love the place! Last week participated in the \"Birding and Breakfast\" event ($13.00 for members). These walks are held each year in April and May and are guided by expert birders. I counted about 36",

        "wiki": "Winnipeg ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America.\nThe city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2016, Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500. Being far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F).Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWinnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as \"The Forks\". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.Sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the M\u00e9tis because of sharing a traditional culture.\n\nLord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M\u00e9tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.In 1869\u201370, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of M\u00e9tis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. M\u00e9tis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1900\u2013present) ===\nBy 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.\n\nMore than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled \"Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise\" (commonly known as the \"Golden Boy\"). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nIn the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan \"unicity\" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011, in each of these floods, the Red River Floodway was used to safely protect the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWinnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of 464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around \u221216.4 \u00b0C (2.5 \u00b0F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in). Temperatures occasionally drop below \u221240.0 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F).

          "A wonderful museum chock full of information and surprises. It has a full size old ship in an old town setting and you can climb aboard and explore. Lots of information on Inuit life and the start of the Hudson Bay Company. Amazing exhibits of fossils. Well worth visiting for",
          "Everything you want to know about Manitoba is probably in this building. History, geology, culture, etc. The displays are wonderful. A small gift shop.",
          "I really enjoyed my guided tour of this museum. They have everything: a ship, fossils, fabric, weapons, and on and on.You could easily spend the whole day here. They also have a terrific gift shop! What more could I ask.",
          "I recently participated in the Museum's Now and Then program. This is a program designed for people with early to middle dementia and their caregivers. It is two hours long and includes an introduction, a visit to a gallery, coffee and cookies and then an activity associated",
          "My family recently visited the museum and there is so much to see. We planned on 2 hours but it wasn't enough. Many exhibits have some hands-on features which are great for the younger ones. Admission prices are very reasonable and I can't give any feedback on the gift shop",
          "Huge museum with displays on rocks and fossils from 10,000 years ago thru current time. Almost too much to absorb.",
          "Took a 1.5 hour tour and it was very interesting. I\u2019m not a big fan of museums but really enjoyed this one. Lots of great exhibits and they also have a full size ancient ship there.",

          "This was a fun Museum. Best to have 4 hrs or more to spend here! The best parking was right across from the entrance to the Museum an. Further away cost more and lots of construction around too. Lots of historical infomation and interactive Displays, like an old Downtown",
          "Loved this museum. It will be so nice once all the dioramas are done. Love the info on the HBC and the Nunsuch ship. Great collection of Metis and Indigenous peoples. Fantastic collection of rocks, minerals and fossils. Only suggestions are more washrooms and a water fountain.",
          "It's been a while since I last visited (around 9 years). The main exhibits is a nice showcase of the History, geology and wildlife of the province. There are also some interactive exhibits for a more hands-on experience. The centerpiece of the museum, for me, is most definitely",
          "Here with three friends. Nice planetarium and great exhibits. The ship, Nonesuch, was a real treat. Also, the recreation of the downtown area was great. However, who puts that much emphasis on a general strike? Honestly, it was important piece of local history, but so was",
          "Took a walk thru the general museum and had a good time. The displays were very impressive and the ship was awesome. Took about an hour. Warning! Parking was expensive. $7 for 2 hours.",
          "This museum consists of several different and very vibrant displays. There is a life-size replica of the Nonsuch, the small ship built in 1680 that brought some of the first settlers. There are tableaux around this exhibit showing aspects of the harsh life and living conditions",
          "I've been visiting the Museum since I was a kid. Now that I have kids of my own I realize how aggravated MY parents must have been when all I wanted to see was the Nonsuch. Okay, and the early movie theatre. Every other gallery is run through faster than beans through a bear.",
          "We enjoyed this museum for the first hour or so but after that all we wanted to do was find an exit. We enjoyed the ship but there were just so many exhibits. They suggested two hours but we could\u2019ve spent the whole day in the main exhibit. It was also very expensive",
          "I think my kids (21, 18, 13) and I could have spent the entire day at this place. We budgeted a few hours and stuck to the main galleries, which gave us a great taste of the region. The museum is very thoughtfully laid out and constructed. My head was swimming with",
          "Loved this museum and you can take photos and videos for your personal use! The dioramas of of the Arctic/Subarctic, Boreal Forest and Grasslands are outstanding! The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 exhibit was remarkable. The Nonsuch, a 17th-century replica sailing ship,",
          "While visiting our family in Winnipeg we went to this museum. We went into the inside/out museum. It was so interesting. We had never seen anything like that before. The rest of the museum is really good. Well worth a visit",
          "We had a amazing guide, she made the history of Manitoba come to life for us. I think the big ship there, was the highlight for us.",
          "I love this place, so interesting.so very many exhibits.I particularly enjoyed both the nonsuch exhibit and the section on native mythologyallow several hours to see this more if have children.",
          "We enjoy going to the museum quite a few times a year. With the size our family it actually made more sense to buy the year family pass an have been doing it for a few years now. Always lots to see an with new exhibits all the time there is always something new to learn. The",
          "We visited the museum in the evening, where only one of the exhibits was open. We were very interested in the Animal Inside Out exhibit. A fascinating look at animals from the inside through a process called Plastination. It was educational!",
          "If you want to know the prehistory, the ancient history and the near modern history of the Manitoba area, then this will give you a good introduction. Based on both timelines, and geographical areas, this gives you the potted version of the natural history and the anthropocene",
          "We only went for the afternoon. You will need to budget more time than that if you want to see all that the galleries contain. This museum is superb--and loaded with informative displays. We particularly liked the exhibition commemorating the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike and the",
          "The upgrades to the Nonsuch are so authentic. The taking around town and the sounds you hear make you feel like you\u2019re there. And the lightning is amazing. They are continuing to improve and upgrade many of the areas Be sure to also check out the animals body exhibit. So",
          "Loved our time here. It was the time frame when 'Animals Inside and Out' was there. It was just fantastic and amazing!",
          "It was a really fun day. It's not really modern.. but the kids enjoyed it and we got a sense of the history of Manitoba. Lots of acknowledgement of the indigenous people of Manitoba so that great to see. It told a more complete history.",
          "This museum was not on our \"must do\" list while planning our visit to Winnipeg and we sure are glad we opted to check it out! What a spectacular museum! The Nonsuch is of course the highlight with its lively harbour front. But the other exhibits are worth it as well. The",
          "The most complete museum of Manitoba life. From the earliest settlers to current life. Plus right now the special exhibit of Animals inside out until Sept. Planetarium has Capcom go -The Apollo story with the 5oth anniversary of touchdown on the Moon. Strike 1919 which",
          "Lots to see and do for a family! Loved how they had interactive cards to involve people in searching for birds, animals, etc. in the The displays. Beautiful panoramic scenes with incredible detail. The Nonsuch was amazing. Animals Inside Out was a very graphic, informative",
          "Make sure you check their hours off operation, doing the full museum will take approximately 4 hours.",
          "I am a teacher and took my \"family\" of several grade 7 and 8 students (teenagers) who greatly enjoyed the experience! The renovated space for the Nonsuch is always a hit! The students also appreciated the hands-on interactive activities in the Science gallery. Very interesting",
          "Great museum showing the history of Manitoba through time. Good quality exhibits, very fresh feel, could have spent longer there.",
          "I had not visited for many years so it was a pleasure to go again...the impressive Nonsuch which we learned was constructed and then the museum built around it. The exhibit of the Manitobe 1919 Strike commemorates the 100th anniverary...so glad we happened to be visiting to see",
          "We just enjoyed a great afternoon with our family at the museum. Recent upgrades and a new 1919 section make this remarkable. Our grandchildren loved the Science section. This is our second trip back and I look forward to our return. Don't miss out on this special place in our",
          "It's a very nice museum overall. It would be nice to see some changes in the exhibits though, as they have been pretty much the same for years. There's special exhibits that come around about once a year, but you pay extra to go into them and they're generally overpriced for",
          "Been here a few times and it's been amazing every time. Love the exhibits and what you are able to learn in the whole museum. Definitely, a favorite place to visit.",
          "Business meeting went on so we went to this venue to relax a bit. Very interest venue with a hard working staff that made the visit great. 1.5 hours of unexpected education.",
          "While I enjoyed the modifications done to the century village display for the General Strike of 1919, I couldn't help but notice the need for some general updating. The temporary 'Animal Inside Out' exhibit (showing until Sept 2) was excellent; great lighting and dramatic",
          "The museum seems to be in the process of updating their exhibits to update the user experience. So far so good; keep going. We really enjoyed everything but I can see it getting even better in the future.",

          "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019d been to the museum. What a great place to see history. What a class act. You have to come to see it. Not only from tourists but also from locals. Great place.",
          "There are a number of dioramas that appear to be single animals yet contain almost a dozen different species. It is difficult sometimes to differentiate between painted and real. Better display than the National Nature Museum in Ottawa, which is also incredible in its' own",
          "It's hard to take your kids to an activity that doesn't cost a small fortune. Our museum is honestly overpriced and doesn't offer anything super exciting. I think there would be more visitors if the prices were cut in half.",
          "We spent almost the whole day here and can't wait to go back again! The Nonsuch gallery with the ship, the docks, and the warehouses; the boreal forest gallery with the bridge, the trees and the animals; and the old town gallery, with the board walk, the old stores and",
          "Our tour group had an excellent tour of portions of the museum, including the Nonsuch display. We could have easily spent an entire day reading and learning from the well maintained displays. As our tour group was interested in the aurora, we also attended a planetarium show on",
          "We were so impressed with this museum! The Nonsuch merchant ship and surrounding town display was phenomenal! The details, down to the realistic rain sounds, were amazing. We had a wonderful and informative tour as well. Also enjoyed all the other displays, especially the",

          "we love family days at the Manitoba Museum. Manitoba truly is a wonderful province and i'm sure there is something here that would interest everyone",
          "This is a rich and rewarding museum that communicates its messages well. The exhibits comprise Manitoba through the ages using a straightforward, well thought out time line approach. You glance at the province through its fossils, dinosaurs, original people culture, the",
          "I have been going to this museum on and off for field trips since I was a child. I always loved visting this place. I intend to take my son sometime soon! I love the giant pirate ship that you can go on and all the interesting information that educates us of the past. I highly",

          "Several of the exhibits were closed for construction when we were there but over all it's a pretty cool place to visit. We bought a year membership for our family,but not sure we will use it again. The parking is outrageously priced if you want to go several times a year. It",
          "We absolutely loved this place. We were lucky enough to catch the hockey exhibition too which made it even better. You cant compare it to the Human Rights Museum which is more modern and high tech. This place tells the local story superbly. You'll want at least two hours. I",
          "Many interesting displays of provincial history. I've seen one movie in the planetarium, \"Life: A Cosmic Story\" and it was very interesting. The screen is actually the doomed roof. Great seats that you can sit back and look up to enjoy the view. Very informative show. I will",
          "We visited with grandchildren 5 & 10 years old to learn about the pioneer life; what brought people to Manitoba; the work that supported their lifestyle and even how many kids the average family had. After seeing the Museum of Human Rights the day prior, this museum seemed out",
          "Beautifully set up. Soo much information to take in and involves all your senses in the experience. The nonsuch is a highlight as is the old world town. A joy to explore for all ages! Our family has loved this museum since our children were very young through adult.",
          "I haven't been to the Manitoba Museum since the Golden Boy was on display, which had to be at least 15 years ago! This weekend we decided to go, mainly to see the new, improved Nonshuch display, and it was well worth it! Newer displays (well, for us) included the Parkland",
          "Visited the Manitoba Museum today with my brother, sister-in-law, and nieces (11, 13, 15). There was so much to do, we never made in past the ground floor. The science discovery zone for kids is fantastic! Perfect for kids of all ages. We also saw a show in the planetarium. We",
          "There\u2019s a lot to do and learn here I remember being in school as a kid doing sleep overs here that were a lot of fun. This place has a great pirate attraction. Everything here is awesome really!",
          "Manitoba museum is a must for all people, children and adults. I've been going every year or so, and I see a little something new every time. It's timeless, and the staff is knowledgeable and always ready to answer questions. It truly is a must see, visit and enjoy",

          "You could spend a whole day in this place. There is so much to see within this building that it can be a little overwhelming. The museum covers natural and past history. Our group only had a couple hours there, so we didn't see everything.",
          "This museum is done well and offers a variety of quality exhibits. It even has a ship as a focal point in the middle of the museum! It offers a Science Gallery that isn't just for kids and a planetarium that offers laser shows during certain times of the year which are really",
          "Haven\u2019t been to the Museum in a long time since I was young. It was a great day lots to learn and see! The nonsuch ship was one of the highlights to see. There is also the Hockey Exhibit which was my highlight! Jerseys, sticks and equipment from the greatest players of all",
          "This is a brilliant museum, so much to see. Make sure you go early because you'll end up staying most of the day. I especially liked seeing and going aboard the replica of the 'Nonsuch', the ship that set up the Hudson Bay trading. Loads of history about the Indians which was",
          "There is a great deal of information in this museum, and if you love to read detailed exhibits, you'll enjoy it a lot. Kids and adults alike will like the exhibit of the Nonsuch boat. If you're a hockey lover, the special exhibit that was there when we visited will be a winner.",
          "We love this museum, the displays and interactive walk through areas are stunning. This is a crown to a beautiful city. The renovated 'non-such' merchant vessel is a real treat to see in person. The entire room where this ship is located goes through the various times of day,",

          "From the moment you walk in and see the bison, you're on a journey through Manitoba's history. The galleries provide a walk through of Manitoba's various regions and important moments in our history. If you want to just do a quick walk through, or go in depth and read a ton of",
          "We attended the evening planetarium show of Stranger Things. The music was good but the show was very underwhelming. I probably would not return. It would be a great idea for the museum to feature an adult only evening night at the museum, where adults could do hands on",
          "The Museum's predecessors date back almost 140 years! The Museum's main thrusts include-- the Science hall, a Planetarium and the natural and human heritage of Manitoba. It is the largest museum in Manitoba. The History of Manitoba is closely associated with the Hudson's Bay",

          "This is one of the better natural-history-type museums anywhere, but not only that it has a planetarium and a third wing, a science gallery, for hands-on activities. There's separate pricing depending on how many of the three you visit. There's even a separate but attached",

          "The museum was pretty good and my favourite area is the part in the end...it's the town and Charlie Chaplin film. I remember going when I was a kid and I liked they kept some of the old displays. One part I wasn't impressed with and it's only minor, not enough drinking",

          "went for the pirates exhibit and still went to all galleries as it is always intersting for all including gd dad 99 who can have the use of a wheel chair...good to do on a rainy day too",
          "This place is awesome. The total experience is worth coming for again and again. The annual pass is great value.",
          "This is greater all ages. Some hands on experiences.Historical displays and info on th provinces beginnings - Aboriginals, settlers, battles, progress unto the current issues.",
          "The museum portion covered everything from geology to fur trading history to present day industries. The crown jewel of this museum is the several stories in height Nonsuch tall ship. There is also a science centre and a planetarium for added extra fees.",
          "Great museum for all ages. Lots of fun gallery's to go through. I didn't visit the Science Galley, but walked through part of it on my way to the Planetarium, and it seems like the kids there were enjoying themselves. :) The Planetarium was what you would expect one to be. I",
          "Excellent exhibits and variety. Exhibits are real and life like productions. Good for learning prairie history. Good for families. I have been there several times beginning when my children were young.",
          "Had an amazing afternoon at the museum and science center. Our 4 year old was in awe and so we're we. One afternoon isn't enough. So many exhibits with such an emense amount of detail. Lots of fantastic items in the gift shop. + 3 Pok\u00e9stops accessible from rest area in the",
          "Great museum, excellent exhibits, even though some were blocked off for renovations. the kids loved the Nonsuch, especially with the engaging staff that encouraged questions.",
          "There are a lot of different, interesting exhibits, including the science and history exhibits. I've always enjoyed going there because you can really never get tired of seeing everything again. Great for rainy days because kids won't get bored with all the hands-on exhibits.",
          "This Museum has existed for a long time but the first diorama as you enter the museum space take my breath away every time. We do not go often as we do not live in the province but it still has an impact. Not much has changed over the years but you can take something new away",
          "We were on our way to the zoo, but unfortunately or should I say fortunately Mother Nature had another idea. We changed our plans and headed to the Museum. There are many exhibits and it looks like many are still being set up. Last time I was there was over 12 years ago, and I",
          "It had been many years (15+) since we visited the museum. We were happy to see many of our favourite exhibits again and happy to see many new displays. One of the old favourites is definitely the Nonsuch ship. The new prairie exhibit was great. We arrived at 2:30, thinking",
          "Our family visited on Canada day so the place was very quiet, only saw 2 other families. There is A LOT to see but it is very dated. The ship is the highlight of the entire place. We also visited the planetarium and science center in the same building. Both dated as well but",
          "In Winnipeg to spend some time exploring the city, stopped in to explore the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of exhibits plenty to see and do.",
          "Very well arranged museum timeline from distant past to present. We had only 2 hours, and could have spent 4. The combination of geologic, animal and human history was awesome. Really gave us a sense of MB life.",
          "Great activity for rainy day for school age children and up. Educational and informative about natural history of Manitoba. A must see in Winnipeg. Allow 2 to 3 hours minimum to do it justice.",
          "The path of enjoyable education of this Museum is quite incredible. We have seen it several times and each time we are surprised by either an new exhibit or was it something we missed in the past?",
          "The exhibits at this museum start out with geology, dinosaurs, all the futzy, child-oriented dreck -- then moves to Arctic ecosystems and exploration, an incredible reproduction of a 1680s British trade ship, Hudson's Bay trade goods room, a snakepit (really), a recreated",
          "Fun afternoon looking at all the new displays...always love looking at the boat and all the old antiques... love the Charlie Chaplin film that was playing in the theatre. Great way to spend an afternoon for any reason... this time it was for a birthday for an adult. Good",
          "What a delightful surprise. Currently there is a Chagal exhibit. What a wonderful display of Chagal's prints for a book titled \"Douphin and Chloe\". They also have the largest Inuit collection and it is fantastic. I loved it. The gallery is spacious and airy. There was also",
          "The Manitoba Museum is a nice museum. Many of the exhibits are starting to look dated, 70's fonts and displays, which is only exaggerated by the shiny new-ness of the ship exhibit. But it is still an interesting museum. It starts with the pre-historic animals that would have",
          "A great place to learn about Manitoba history. Reconstructed historic ship was amazing. Other exhibits about regional history & geography. We learned a lot! Spent 3+ hours (we are slow museum-goers.) We visited the history part only, not the planetarium or natural history",
          "Very nice museum. Love the Hudson's bay ship historical displays. Very well presented for the kid On all of us. Great gift shop too.",
          "The museum still has many wonderful exhibits and has expanded/renovated to include a couple of new ones over the last few years. Kids still love visiting the Nonsuch. This ship has been described as one of the finest replicas in the world. It actually was used to sail about",
          "We had a nice morning here with our young child. Parts were very nice like the ship, HBC collection, wildlife....others are showing their wear. It was something to fill our day and we all learned something new!",
          "This place has hardly changed since the 70s and it shows. Obviously they haven't had any money to upgrade it, but it's pitifully dated, and needs a complete overhaul. If you're from a city larger than Winnipeg you won't be impressed, but if you have very young children it will",
          "This is a must for those who want to take in the history of Manitoba and how others helped make Winnipeg with fur trade etc. Lots to see and do. Paid parking across the street on north side watch where you park even on a weekend when no one was using stalls that we didn't notice",
          "This is a great place to spend a rainy day! You can spend all day here! It is not cheap to get it so it is well worth to spend time looking and reading the exhibits. They have added things since we were here last. If you have very very young kids it may be hard for the",
          "We spent an entire afternoon wandering around all the exhibits. It was a bit pricey to get in but well worth it. We weren't rushed in any way and we covered the entire museum. If you love history and want to see how things were, it is the place to go. We took friends from",
          "The entire museum looks like it is stuck in the 1970s. The National Geographic Earth Explorer exhibit was new, but unimpressive to say the least - very amateur displays with minimal educational content for kids. Overall, the museum is not worth the price of admission.",
          "was just ok ... too much walking for too little to see. and was way to expensive ! would not recommend going here if you have trouble walking.... parking is also expensive .",
          "We went with four kids aged 4-8. They all LOVED different displays/interactive activities a the Science Gallery. Smaller guys enjoyed the water table and racing electric cars on a track. The older girls loved solving a crime, the mirror room, pulling their weight up with the",
          "A great collection of facilities...all well done. The museum is top notch and packed with great displays including a full size warship, turn of the century street scene ( love this), and natural displays. Love the adjacent planetarium and kids museum. Love the 60's",
          "My sons and I visited this museum in Jan, 2016. It was really cold outside and I was dreading where to park. Parking is a breeze. It is right across the street. We entered and walked through the exhibits. By far the most exciting stop was viewing the HBC boat ( a replica of the",
          "This is the best place to take your family to lots of interesting stuff and learn about history and it comes alive . There is also different sections in the museum like grasslands the bluenose and Buffalo run or a small town where there is a cinema you can watch. Educational",
          "We took our son to the MB Museum for his birthday. We found it quite expensive. It brought back a lot of memories from when I was a child and would go with school or with family. Things didn't seem to have changed either.",
          "Had a free day last week while in Winnipeg, and being rather windy, decided to go to the Manitoba Museum. Was not really sure what sort of Museum it would be, but it is an excellent natural history museum, with some cultural areas, such as a \"streets of old Winnipeg\" village,",
          "Hello Trippies, My wife and i decided to throw my 4 year olds' birthday party at the Manitoba Museum this year. We rented a party room which was pretty basic and decorations were quite basic but enough. The pricing was fair and all the kids and parents attending had a great",
          "The Manitoba museum includes several exhibit venues. If you have only a couple of hours you will only have time for a hurried trip through one venue. There is a convenient parking lot on the north side of the building. I recommend the natural history side first. It explains the",
          "I went to the museum in February 2016 to see the special exhibit on the centenary of Manitoba women getting the vote. However, that exhibit was just a small part of the museum. We particularly enjoyed the Nonsuch, a replica of the boat the Hudson's Bay Company used when it was",
          "More than $90 admission. No family rate? More than twice the admission of le Louvre. Could use updating. Not exactly encouraging education here.",
          "I took my mom here over the holidays as it has been years since my last visit. The displays are very educational and detailed. Our favourites are still the Nonsuch and the theatre that shows a Charlie Chaplin movie. We also took in Earth Explorers Exhibition - great for kids",
          "My girlfriend and I did a tour of the Manitoba Museum. We came at around three pm and were advised the museum closes at four pm. We were given a discount for the time. That was very much appreciated. I really liked the town, the dioramas, models and exhibits about immigration.",
          "I have Been there and it's not only very informative and interesting but also worth visiting. I strongly recommend to visit for everybody.",
          "This was an interesting museum and was much larger than I expected. There was a lot of exhibits but they were not organized chronologically. I would not recommend the main museum for young children. We also visited the Science Gallery. This was much smaller than I expected but",
          "We all enjoyed this Museum! There is a lot to see and interact with. Highly recommend you stop in here if you are in winnipeg. We spent several hours here and the kids learned alot",
          "The Manitoba museum is really great. It is very interesting and my kids (aged 3-8) really enjoy going as well. They tend to walk through some sections quite quickly and then spend a lot of time in other sections, which is fine. They always seem to come out knowing something",
          "This place have many interesting content. Hudson Bay, Old Manitoba, Aboriginal life, Arctic life, a large size ship,",
          "My parents used to take us here as children when we would visit family in Winnipeg. I recently visited the museum with my partner when we were in the area, and it was just as fun and interesting as I remember it being when I was a kid. I could spend hours reading about all of",
          "If you have never been go, educational and interesting. Kids will love the Nonsuch ship and area. as a local who visits ones or twice a year I find it becoming dated and in need of a face lift. the traveling exhibits are a nice change but will add to the cost of regular admission",
          "We've always found this to be a great time although it might not be that interesting for younger kids. Lots of great insights to Manitoba history and tradition.",
          "Over the years since I was a child I have visited the museum at least once a year. Very informative and interactive. The gallerys have changed and evolved, but the ones that have stayed the same need to be revamped and updated. Overall a must see. A great way to spend the day",
          "This museum certainly needs a makeover. Still running Windows 95 on some computers. The planetarium is great but could use some new films. I didn't care much for the earth explorers temporary exhibit. My kid loves the science gallery, but it too is dated.",
          "We have been there an number of times since becoming members. We have gone with friends and taken our grandchildren to the xoxo exhibit - had a hard time getting them to leave. The restaurant is a nice place for lunch or coffee.",
          "Skillful staff have put together a wonderful exhibit showing the diversity of Manitoba's ecosystems, and historical treasures. Everyone is impressed with walk-through forest, prairie and tundra exhibits and climb-aboard display of the ship, the Nonsuch. Sounds, sights and smells",
          "I love this Museum, there is always something new on Display and the Science part in the basement is always always fun!!! I usually end up taking 6 kids with me and teaching them how so many things work because of science.... and that they should listen in class! lol",
          "We went as a family and very much enjoyed the Manitoba Museum .., it is great for all ages and especially good for school outings!!!",
          "great place to start if this is your first visit to Manitoba and you like history and nature. We walked along the river from the Fort Garry hotel but it is a pretty long walk (~1 mile each way)",
          "My wife and I took a couple of friends to visit the museum as we had not been there for a couple of years. Displays give an excellent view of what life was like in Manitoba in the past, specially the full-size replica of the Nonsuch. We have visited museums in Washington and",
          "This museum was on our city tour and I am very glad it was included. I wish we could have had more time there. Because we were on our way to Churchill we had a talk about Inuit culture and went to those exhibits at the museum. Very enjoyable and informative. And of course",
          "This museum provides an interesting collection of exhibits, an enjoyable visit. I had the opportunity to participate in a conference event that took place in this venue. It was an interesting venue - but captured my attention none the less.",
          "Absolutely incredible museum! I was really impressed of its expositions and 3d dioramas. I strongly recommend to visit this amazing place!",
          "This Museum covers a vast range of subjects that allows the local and International visitor to learn just about everything they will ever want to know about the Province the region and the Country. There are fantastic exhibits explaining the geological history of the country,",

          "We've been going to the Manitoba Museum for over 40 years and love it every time. There is something for everyone here, but the exhibit on the fur trade and Nonsuch (spelling?) is superb. A great place to take the family for a day.",
          "Always good to stop in here, it has been a few years, but why wouldn't you want to see a museum. Offers a great variety of what there is to offer out there much less great displays and well put together flow. Not a museum one should get bored in.",
          "I found the museum to be a place of contrast. First off, you go through some rather old, poorly done, and confusing exhibits, with a jumble of artefacts from all over the world. Then, you get to a section where you are expecting dinosaurs, and what you get are some pictures of",
          "Excellent museum to learn about all aspects of the history of this region including really good exhibits about the history and influence of the Hudson's Bay Company. A real treat was the opportunity to explore the replica of the sailing ship Nonsuch.",
          "We took in the entire building. This included the science areas and the planetarium. The new show in the planetarium is great. The kids still enjoy the museum and getting to board the ship Nonsuch. A family would really need at least 3 to 4hours to do all 3 venues properly.",
          "We only had a couple of hours to spend at the Museum. It was very well presented and most interesting. We loved getting aboard the old ship and imagining what it must have been like to travel a long distance on such a boat. I would highly recommend this museum.",
          "The Manitoba museum is a wonderful attraction for young and old alike. We took our grandchildren, the youngest being just 3 years old and he loved the visit as much as we did. The displays, the information and the variety are all done well. Some favorite attractions were the",

          "I have been here several times, my husband and youngest grandson, had not. My husband who is from Chicago, thought it was excellent. The little guy said it was cool. The 12 year-old and I, really enjoyed it. We did not go to the Planetarium. The Science Gallery on the lower",
          "Love this place since I was a kid. I get to go every year on field trips with my class. There is always something new to see or a theme. The science Center was so much fun for all ages. The theme was Pirates this year. Love walking through the museum and seeing all the history.",
          "The museum has not been updated in many years. Focuses mainly on local history. I would not recommend going.",
          "This museum is wonderful, but to enjoy it, dedicate at least a few hours. It has hands on as well as reading content. Wonderful full-sized boat available inside for tour. Great display on the history of the Hudson Bay Company also. Some beautiful First Nations artifacts that",
          "I have been going to this museum since I was small. One thing it has going for it is the collections of local history. Yes, some of the exhibits could use some updating (and dusting), but I was pleasantly surprised at some of the newer installations. Far more artifacts from",

          "The musuem was a bit pricey I thought, if it had been cheaper than I would have rated it higher- my 4 year old had to pay and was interested only for a few minutes. It did have some cool things. The kids liked the fossils, the animal displays, the cave, the frog scavenger",
          "I live in Winnipeg and had not visited the museum in years. Yesterday, |I took my three grandchildren (ages 8,6,2) for a visit to the museum. The children had a ball looking at the exhibits ranging from prehistoric times to turn of the 20th century Winnipeg, The exhibits are",
          "We Had a great day at the museum and planetarium with my family on the 29 th July my children are 5 and 3 they really enjoyed the museum and the Sesame Street show in the planetarium especially it was worth the visit just for that . I was taken to the museum on a family holiday",
          "I have an annual pass which I have maintained for 4 years. I find this to be an inexpensive way to always have a go to place when the kids need to be entertained on a rainy day. There are enough special events at the museum during the year to keep things interesting. An annual",

          "Honestly, we went because we had an extra hour or two to kill in Winnipeg. It was a decent museum to kill an hour or two, but I honestly wouldn't plan a vacation around visiting here.",
          "This museum has everything from huge displays of buffalo hunts to small interactive areas that are great learning spots of adults and children alike. to view it properly you need more than a couple of hours, and it is very easy to kill several hours if you so choose.. There is",

          "I've seen some great museums in my day and this one ranks right up there. Really enjoyed the displays (Buffalo hunt, First Nations life) and the great connections to Metis history. The Hudson Bay ship and yard is totally breathtaking, that alone worth the price of admission.",

          "I have to admit, I wasted a lot of time at the \"natural history section\" at the beginning of the recommended path. (This part doesn't stand a chance when compared to the dinosaur exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.) So I ran out of time, when I entered the real cool",

          "I've been to Winnipeg on a multiple trips and was taken to this museum during one of our stays. This museum is amazing! Just getting the history of Manitoba is worth the price of admission. We've been to a few museums in the U.S., but this was the first one that lets you",

          "This museum was on par with (if not better than) many regional museums I've been to in Canada and the US. It's a good introduction to Manitoba for a visitor who's never been here before, but it's also informative and entertaining enough that locals would want to keep coming",
          "It's a museum...what can I say? There are a lot of nice displays and you can basically spend as little or as much time here as you would care to. A lot of history. Interesting facts about immigration and the Europeans coming over. The replica of the ship will always be a",
          "Great museum, organised according to themes, but you will need MUCH more than the estimated two hours to get through!",
          "I've been to many museums and this museum has wonderful dioramas (displays). They actually use real trees for instance (preserved and repainted) so that dioramas seem lifelike. Certainly they don't look plastic. The entire museum is a treat until you get to the middle and then",
          "I never tire of seeing the displays, there is always something I missed seeing on the last trip. Great place to take the kids. Don't forget to see the planetarium while you are there.",

          "The Manitoba Museum is exactly as I remembered it as a young person. The exhibits have changed little over the years to the point where the museum has a retro feel to it. Some of the exhibits are reading heavy so young children may lose interest. One nice part of the museum is",

          "It's a good place to take kids. They have more Indigenous/Metis exhibits every time we go. (Which is super important for a museum intending to display Manitoba and Winnipeg historical artifacts.)",
          "Great spot to take the family. Dinosaur, boats, rocks, mining, animals of the plains and the settling of Manitoba. The best though is the inside out exhibition. Amazing art and learning about animals and how they work. Didn't get to the planetarium but on the next time. I recommend for families. Good afternoon trip.",
          "Cool place. Get the family membership. Two visits with the family and it pays for itself.",
          "Some cool stuff.  Not the greatest museum, but still earth the visit.",
          "Interesting and informative with interactive displays. The Nonsuch Gallery is especially well done. Two hours was not enough time.",
          "My daughter loves the Science Gallery, I highly recommend to anyone to go.",
          "This is an amazing place.  But even to watch zone 1 you need more than 3.5 hours.  If possible, it is better to come here on weekdays.  Less visitors on weekdays are there",
          "It's been a while since I last visited (around 9 years). The main exhibits is a nice showcase of the History, geology and wildlife of the province. There are also some interactive exhibits for a more hands-on experience. The centerpiece of \u2026",
          "Actually really impressed! Some of the displays are obviously old so I question the info shared by them. But as a whole, excellent place! I suggest a face lift to these 60s or 70s displays!",
          "Great to go if you have the tour guide for large groups.",
          "The historic ship that you can board, along with the recreation of a slice of port area to explore, is an effective high point. The attached science center / planetarium can add up to a whirlwind day, but if you want it to be educational, pace yourself. The upstairs museum itself is a lot to absorb in one trip.",
          "Tons of history about Canada, the Nonesuch replica was the perfect centerpiece.  (I just wish they let us go below decks!). The inside out animal exhibit was too creepy for me, but the main exhibits we're really good.",
          "Great place to spend an afternoon with the whole family. Our toddler fell asleep on the drive home... Wiped!",
          "We went to visit the planetarium the Fred Penner, in my backyard show was great for my 6 & 3 year old. It was Very educational for young children. Our admission also included the animals inside out exhibit. We went through twice. My kids and myself were really interested in the exhibits.",
          "Museum offers guest exhibitions along with permanent ones. I think the best part is the science area, though not all the exhibits there are in 100% working condition. The real scale ship is also very impressive. I think you should have 3 hours to visit the museum, otherwise you won't enjoy the visit.",
          "Had an amazing time looking at everything. The place is very big and has tons to explore. We paid for the planetarium show and we were just shown an episode of a kids show commonly aired on TV.",
          "The Animal's Inside Out exhibit was amazing! The planetarium show was good, but makes you very dizzy and hurts your neck if you don't sit in the right seats since the projections are for some reason only shown on one side of the screen.",
          "Great museum, the Manitoba history is here, with great pictures and scenes of Canada growing up.",
          "Go here quite often.. the exhibits as usual were very informative. I read most of them, especially those about geology and ancient creatures. Saw the new inside out exhibits too. Kind of gross.. but interesting to look at nonetheless.",
          "Love this place, cool place to hang out, noce for families and fun place to stop by on during a date. Strongly recommend. Also the science area downstairs is fun no matter how old you are",
          "We went to visit the planetarium the Fred Penner, in my backyard show was great for my 6 & 3 year old. It was Very educational for young children. Our admission also included the animals inside out exhibit. We went through twice. My kids and myself were really interested in the exhibits.",
          "Amazing museum. It went through ancient Canada through Native Canadian times, present day, and everything in between. An amazing attraction is a life size replica ship you can enter. When I visited there was a traveling exhibit featuring \u2026",
          "Definitely worth stopping here adults and children will enjoy the exhibits.",
          "A great family experience for all ages.",
          "Grew up going, loved it then. Only after going to other museums did I truly have an appreciation for it\nIt's a unique place with plenty to set it apart from an everyday museum. \nPlus they have a ship. Indoors.",
          "I've been going my whole life and still never tire of it. Superb! There's so much to see and the galleries are all laid out differently, it seems constantly being updated or improved, you really can go back again and again and always see something new (but the old favourites remain). Count on spending a solid half a day here.",
          "Really cool museum. It\u2019s laid out as a walk through time beginning with natural history and working all the way through the history of Canada.",
          "The updated galleries are spectacular and the connection to our city, province, and country are important. The exhibits are both educational and exciting, and the Science Centre and Planetarium are spectacular additions.",
          "Always interesting things to see.",
          "Classy Great venue for your corprate party. Also a great place for Educational and Fundamental knowledge!!",
          "Kids had a good time. I still remember some exhibits from my childhood, was cool seeing the kids enjoy it now also. The newly revamped Nonsuch was a hit!",
          "We visited the planetarium and the science gallery with my kids. They had a fun time and the staff was delightful",
          "Well planned and maintained museum in Winnipeg\nBeautifully designed\nSpacious building\nGreat effort to keep rich heritage and culture  alive",
          "Really enjoyed my visit to the Manitoba Nature Museum. Wonderful Exhibits and the Animal Inside Out gallery was incredible. However theyre losing 2 stars for whitewashing Canadian History as it pertains to this nations shameful stain of how it treated its aboriginal persons in the past.  Would recommend though..",
          "The displays have been spruced up  more enjoyable",
          "Very good experience. Many interesting things to see.",
          "Nothing has changed since i was a kid. Desperately needs to be updated somehow",
          "Is a full afternoon, great for energetic children. So many different things to see.",
          "I just loved and totally was spellbound by all of the Native artifacts.",
          "Some of it is out of add but still fun",
          "Lovely place with many different galleries. Each one has unique collection of items to look into. Would be interested to go there again and explore more.",
          "Great place especially if you live in manitoba and know were most of the places are",
          "Everytime you go your going to see something new!\nOffering new shows and exhibits regularly so make the effort to go more often and you'll be truly surprised with the things you'll hear and what will catch your attentions. When you can try \u2026",
          "I always love a good stroll through the Museum.  The upgrades are coming along nicely.  Cant wait to see all the new changes.",
          "Loved A1! A couple of the exhibit's need to be worked on or touched up wee bit just paint, overall it's absolutely a treat to experience there's so many really cool things to see and touch, look at, and learn about. Beautiful gift shop. \u2026",
          "Dope planaterium, great museum as well, lots to see and learn \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udfff",
          "Planetarium was excellent, so happy we took our 8 year old twins there.  They had a great time, and loved learning about the constellations. Not many in attendance unfortunately, but it did allow our \"guide\" to customize the show for the \u2026",
          "The museum is great.  I always notice something new when I come here.  As a family, this is a once a year trip, plus field trips from school.  I do think the science museum could use an upgrade, but the kids think it's fun and I love seeing them learning things.  And the Nonsuch is always awesome to see.",
          "Love the museum. Love learning about history and how it may or may not affect the future",
          "Love it there...so much fun. And what a great space for a special concert event!!!",

          "Member for 8 years, love taking the kids",
          "Although it is current under construction, there is plenty to see. We like that they bring new experiences to the front of the museum and update the shows in planetarium. We will be patrons for life.",
          "Busy when we were there but the staff were quick to answer any questions and the exhibits were expertly curated. We had an amazing time taking in all the history of the province and our country. The special exhibits were also well worth the price of admission.",
          "Lately this museum seems to be changing and adding to its collections of historical artifacts and unusual items on display; that is one reason why I find this museum to be super interesting; one cannot be sure what changes might be \u2026",
          "Great Halloween event however needs improvement on Halloween planetarium movie but still 5 stars",
          "Very interesting, i love each time we go!",
          "Great venue for a company Christmas party.",
          "I try to visit the museum every time I am in a new city. This one did not disappoint! Great exhibits, friendly staff and the planetarium show was amazing (I saw a show about the Manitoba Sky). If I am ever back in Winnipeg, I will definitely return!",
          "This place is very cool.  They make the drive exhibits come alive by building the habitat of the people and animals they are showing.  Ali g with sounds to go with it.  Very well done.",
          "Hello, this is just a request to google to update the time of this place . It just went on its winter schedule. Please match your timing with the manitoba museum website.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nSep 9 to Dec 20\nTuesday to Friday:  10 am \u2013 4 pm \u2026",
          "This place is so awesome, spend hours here. FUN!",
          "Fun. Lots of things to see but once you've gone twice it gets a little less entertaining. Great water table. Fun mirror room. Kinda gloomy and dated inside. The race track is really great when there's a volunteer or staff member helping.",
          "The Nonsuch ship is such a great exhibit that really brings something special and different to the whole museum.\n\nIt's great to purchase a membership too, because it actually gives free entry to a number of other museums and science centres across the country.",
          "This is a rich and rewarding museum that communicates its messages well. \n\nThe exhibits comprise Manitoba through the ages using a straightforward, well thought out time line approach. You glance at the province through its fossils, \u2026",
          "You can stay there for hours and hours. A lot of objects to see, from a real ship to a Charles Chaplin's movie. Is an amazing experience!",
          "Always a great place to bring anyone, no matter their age",
          "Kids love the museum, science and non such gallery. The planetarium is also lovely. It is a long day if you plan on doing the full experience, so plan ahead.",

          "Went with a grade 2 field trip. Was very cool to look around. Lots of exhibits and variety! Great learning experience for the kids.",
          "Always cool to see what is new and see what is really old learning new information.",
          "The Manitoba Museum is very informative and big. It features numerous exhibitions but the permanent one about the culture, history and nature of the province is easily the most important and interesting one.",
          "Fantastic exhibits that are both interesting and educational.",
          "Always a great place to take the family, and it is an amazing wedding venue",
          "Cool museum but it's better to tour it when you're high!",
          "Amazing experience will 100% be back over and over again",
          "This is worth the trip and the adventure. Between the Nonsuch and the replica city there is a lot to see! Love seeing the museum get refreshed!",
          "Great museum, fun place to spend a day learning about Manitoba's history. Layout is a bit of a maze and I got lost a couple of times, still a fun experience. They also have a great planetarium with interesting guided shows.",
          "Great costumer service!",
          "Uber seminar room great acoustics.... Museum is a treasure!",
          "A staple of Manitoba History.  They are constantly changing small things here and there to try and keep this fresh and interesting specifically in the living model of old Winnipeg.",
          "Good place for kids to cut loose",
          "Attended a Google Canada - Grow with Google event here. Was great facility, lighting, sound etc.",
          "Nice walk through local history. Well presented.",
          "Even with some of the displays being updated, the inside out exhibit was amazing to view. Of course learning about our local history, does make this museum the biggest classroom in Manitoba.",
          "It is a very nice place!",
          "Excellent place to nring a family. Lots to see and do - the museum itself, hands on atea for the kids and the planetarium. Only complaint is it is quite pricey.",

          "Beautiful building..helpful staff..great gift shop",

          "Loved the laser light show tonight! Planetarium could use some love in the decor department as it smells very musty",
          "Lots to see and learn! Be sure to join a tour; our guide, Shauna, was very knowledgeable and her enthusiasm was contagious!",
          "Very interesting but could stand some upgrading. \nIe: planetariam needs new reclining seating.",
          "Went here for the 1st time and enjoyed the place. I felt the lights are a bit dark inside. The science gallery and planetarium were closed. It took us around 3 hours to cover the museum.",
          "Dioramas are very well done. Loved the dinosaur fossils and replicas. The Nonesuch is a cool little ship. The Planetarium was neat and relaxing.",
          "I love museums. This was awe-inspiring. I don't go enough. Will make more visits.",
          "A fun way to spend a cold or rainy day. Lots to see and read so make sure you allot enough time to fully explore. The Nonsuch has always been my favourite!",
          "Still has decent exhibits but the price is really steap for the quality.",
          "Great main exhibits but some are SOOOO dated and really need a facelift. Paint is peeling, fonts are from the 70s. They need so TLC. The content is worth seeing though. The special exhibits have always been amazing. I saw the animals inside out and the walking with dinosaurs Among others.",
          "If you love the history! Hi! FIVE!",
          "Always a Great place to visit. New exhibit Very interesting, a must see.",
          "Have a soft spot for the Manitoba Museum. Fond memories from my childhood. Museum Gallery is incredible, loving the chance to explore through my son's eyes and watch a toddler happily exploring this amazing place. Science Gallery (touch the \u2026",
          "Very happy with this place. I take my toddler and preschooler and they are constantly learning once we step through the doors. I highly recommend a membership. It gives us one more place to go in the cold winter months (last year went to paid indoor play grounds a lot) and the membership paid for itself in 3 or less visits.",
          "It will only get better as they finish the new galleries.",
          "Overall, worth seeing. Lots of information and the dioramas are immersive (esp. the Winnipeg 1919 strike).",
          "Very nice, recommend the ship and the planetarium.",
          "Wonderful.alot several hours to see it all\n Don't forget the interactive science gallery and the planetarium.",
          "Great museum with 3 huge areas. Itt could probably take days to read everything that is written about the history of Manitoba. Parking is in front of the museum $10 for 3 hours.",
          "Hasn't changed in 30 years. Great way to spend a few hours learning about culture and history",

          "Visited while waiting for planetarium show. Great use of time!",
          "Quite dated but there is still a lot of valid information. You can spend an evening hear with school aged children but could spend multiple full days by yourself if you would like to take it all in. The Nonsuch and it's surroundings are \u2026",

          "This place is lots of fun but for the love of God why is there no place to buy a snack. Chocolate bars and chips do not cut it. We came with kids and were so shocked there was nowhere to eat once we all got hungry. We had to cut our visit shorter than we had planned.",
          "Went to a musical production at the planetarium, simply amazing!",
          "The museum itself was great, what we did NOT care for was for every different room you must pay to see each part of it, there is just no flat rate you pay and get to enjoy the entire museum. It's a rip off",
          "So much to do here, and with the membership it's incredibly reasonable.  We had a great time and can't wait to go back",
          "Awesome.   Take your own pictures.  Plan a few hours...",

          "Great spot, hidden gem in Winnipeg!",
          "This is probably the most important museum we have that details Manitoba's history. From the Nonsuch replica (an smaller vessel \nused by the HBC and it's fur trade) to explaining true prairie grass to the development of Winnipeg - it covers \u2026",
          "It\u2019s very pricey to go between parking and admission but they put the money to good use.   The museum is the exact same as when I was a little kid, with so much new and improved.  The highlight for me will always be the nonsuch.  I am glad \u2026",

          "Great place for to go with the family",
          "We used to have a family membership to the MB museum and that was a far better value. All in all, the price is high and they have had some of the same stuff for 25+ years. My 5 year old get bored quickly (we went to the science gallery).",
          "Great place to spend with the kids, learning about the history of the world, and Manitoba. The science gallery and planetarium are also awesome. Many hours of fun to be had.",

          "I love going here, the science museum could use a bit of and update for the mirror room... Mostly because it smells weird and lord knows when the last time the slippers were washed. But the main gallery is truly one of a kind. My favorite \u2026",

          "Huge galleries, beautiful exhibits, extremely helpful staff and fair pricing.",
          "I had not visited for many years so it was a pleasure to go again...the impressive Nonsuch which we learned was constructed and then the museum built around it. The exhibit of the Manitobe 1919 Strike commemorates the 100th anniverary...so \u2026",
          "Lots of exhibitions describing the history of Winnipeg from dinosaurs to the colonization",
          "Evy Manitobans should visit The Manitoba Museum at least once in there life. Now I know the story of my province. The great place to go with kids, a lot of scientific games.",
          "We went to the planetarium and enjoyed it very much. Price was good. No free parking though.",

          "The Nonsuch, need I say more",
          "A very informative Museum.\nThe Museum's predecessors date back almost 140 years! The Museum's main thrusts include-- the Science hall, a Planetarium and the natural and human heritage of Manitoba. It is the largest museum in Manitoba. The \u2026",
          "Planetarium was cool.  Nice to see the night sky indoors.  \n\nThe science museum is really dated.  Hasn't really changed from when we first went there 30 years ago and everything is worn out.",
          "A must see for tourists. Well located and properly set up. Highly recommendable.",
          "The museum has had the same displays since it opened 51 years ago. The admission prices have expensively increased over the years too. The planetarium astronomy shows and other fun laser light types of shows are the best thing to see and do \u2026",
          "saw photos of my family in the native section. felt funny. because they were labelled \"indians\" instead of who they really were. people with full names and a history they could be proud of.",
          "Awesome museum. Great collection, fantastic displays. Love a visit to the museum. Go see the nunsuch an entire ship inside",
          "Saw the Rush laser show at the planet-arium.  It was pretty reasonably priced for an hour of entertainment   My group of 9 easily made up more than half of the attendance so it was easy to find a seat.  Was a good show.  Would have been a great show on acid. Would do again.",
          "Underestimated how much time we needed to see it all. Sadly we had to skip a bunch as we also overlooked that the museum closed at 4pm!  Loved the Hudson Bay Company collection. Such a unique piece of our history.",
          "An excellent stop on our way back home.",
          "Worth it to visit at least for once",
          "Love this museum! There's so much to experience! We had memberships when the kids were little and would spend at least 3 hours there at a time, multiple times a year. There was always something new to see! Staff are great, and it's clean and inviting",
          "Still fun and everything I remember from childhood plus new exhibits that keep it new and interesting!",
          "Lots to take in for a couple hours. Some exhibits have aged well but still look forward to future updates. Worth a visit, especially on the cold winter days in Winnipeg!",

          "An excellent museum. Very $$, though, at $17/adult, although a military discount paid for one of our tickets. Parking is astronomically expensive nearby, at over $3/hour and you have to decide how long exactly you'll be. The museum is amazing, though!",
          "Very interesting museum that takes you back to thousands and millions of years ago throughout the history. One of the most interesting stories in the Canadian History is around animal fur trade that Europeans expanded in the region. Hudson \u2026",

          "Bigger than I expected. Spent a good amount of time with First Nation artifacts, which was unique to the museums that I've visited.",
          "Very entertaining. Laser show of Pink Floyd The Wall.  \nLost a star because seats do not recline or have head rests. Leading anyone over 5' to crane neck and strain for a proper view. \nStaff dealt quickly  with a noisy disrespectful group who insisted on using phones during performance as well as hooting and hollering.",
          "Great place for families. Don't forget to try the planetarium. I've been to museums all around the world and I love this one! Really just an awesome place to go learn all kinds of things about Canadian and Manitoban history.",
          "From prehistoric to modern, a good way to travel in time.",
          "I remember going as a kid. I recently went back and it needs a bit of updating. But still a very cool place to check out. Touch the universe needs a complete update though. It's very dated and played.",
          "This was a fun visit. My children enjoyed it as well as it was quite interactive. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the Charlie Chaplin films. I would go again.",

          "Great venue to host an ep release. Fun area to wait for show to begin. And the lights show in the planetarium was awe-inspiring",
          "Quite a bit of neglect and disrepair unfortunately. Some exibits have tv monitors and the display is so old and dark you can't see it any more. Paint was peeling off the walls in the diaramas. Explaination text was rubbed off the walls.If it weren't for the skinless animals exibits, it would not have been worth $120 for a family of 4.",
          "First time being there since I was a kid. Took the whole family and we all had a great time. Very informative and educational and the kids loved it.",
          "A lot of cool things to look at and very informative.",
          "Older style museum with lots of exhibits, no new age holograms or videos. Could use an update but exquisite dioramas and miniatures,full sized displays and a full sized ship you can explore that more than make up for it. Much of the museum \u2026",
          "It's a little pricey to see everything as the science area is not overly exciting. But on a cold day it is a good place to take the children and learn some history.",

          "This place is huge,you will need hours to get to everything",
          "I went to the science gallery. The only word for it is \"embarrassing\". Fine for kids maybe but nothing here for adults at all. The planetarium on the other hand was excellent. The main museum I didn't see which I'm sure is fine. I went to a \u2026",
          "Excellent museum that is fun for all ages. A trip aboard the Nonsuch is always a highlight.",

          "Great history. I like the approach from staff teaching kids about the bones and other history of where the bones came from",
          "Not much has changed in years and years, but actually a good museum that covers Manitoban history quite nicely. It is worth visiting if you are in Winnipeg. Go see the 17th century ship.",
          "I love the museum. It\u2019s very informative and well taken care of. The Nonsuch is beautifully redone. Recommend this museum to anyone.\n\nThe only issue is the single bathroom by the Nonsuch. My wife had to go to a gender neutral bathroom with two men. I admit I am traditional but this museum doesn\u2019t need to push political correctness.",
          "I've been to museums all around the world and I love this one! So many interesting and well done exhibits to go though. There are dinosaurs, attic life, information on the environment and human evolution and of course the ship you get to go \u2026",
          "This is a world class museum. In my travels I always make it a point of visiting museums. In much larger & more affluent cities many museums pale in comparison to this local treasure. I never tire of this place.",

          "the science section is great for kids",
          "Actually at the Concert Hall for the WSO Emmy's music concert. None of the songs were the sort of thing we would choose to listen to in the first place   the performers were not very inspiring so we left at intermission. Not our cup of tea. \u2026",
          "Parking is crazy how high they charge you.  Otherwise the kids loved the science and planetarium",
          "My children had an O.K time here. I'm only giving three stars because they have no interac machines in the museum itself, in fact you have to venture all the way to the Centennial concert hall in order to pull out cash so do so before \u2026",
          "Lots of great things to see especially the planetarium",
          "So much information! We could have spent a lot more time here.",

          "Haven't been in a while but I was very excited to see lots of new exhibits a little sad about how much the science gallery has changed but it still had fun things to do. The planetarium had a wonderful show on I'm not super into space \u2026",

          "Nice lunar sim!",
          "Had a great time with the Manitoba Museum only problem is is they have absolutely no translating equipment so if you don't either speak English or French you're basically just going to be looking at pictures for the whole 4 to 5 hours",
          "Awsome place to go there with children. Very informative and cover the whole history of manitoba. When you go there, find the ship - a walk inside is a must.",
          "Yup. Nonsuch is back and better than ever",

          "Very interesting with lots of displays and facts.",
          "The main museum galleries have so much to see we regretted trying to do all of the sections of the museum in one day.  The Nonsuch is as cool as I remember it from childhood.",
          "January 17th,  2019 with our English class we had a field trip to The Manitoba Museum. We met at arranged time at the Manitoba Museum meeting room where we were offered water and snacks. Nice surprise for me was that we could leave our \u2026",
          "Nice clean museum! Saw The moving dinosaur exhibit, nice to see good for kids but I think that it could have been bigger for adults. The museum itself is big especially if you look at all the exhibits and read the signs. A person could easily spend all day here, or a good portion of one.",

          "I've got a bit of nostalgia for the exhibits here - I went a lot as a kid. The nonsuch was closed when we went, but it's because they're updating the exhibit. Good to see that they're always looking to freshen up the museum!",
          "Love, love love!! Great place to go with kids",

          "A favourite from when I was a kid, back when it was still the Museum of Man and Nature.  A must see when you visit the city.  Classic exhibits merge with newer ones.  A wonderful way to spend the day.  Some areas are a bit dogeared, but for me it only contributes to my walk down memory lane.",
          "Loveit",
          "I bought a year pass for the family. It will be paid back in just 5 visits. The museum is great, lots of interesting things and well displayed articles relevant to Canada and Manitoba. The science gallery downstairs is a lot of fun too. \u2026",

          "Cool museum. Could be organized a bit better and more clearly but overall was informative and interesting.",
          "We had a pretty good time. Only complaint is the price .  If you are low Income and or have a big family. $20+ a person is way too much. I think the museum should consider family pass prices .  ",
          "We like the museum. But didn\u2019t enjoy the show, time mystery?. Too much noise and laser. All family members don\u2019t like it.",
          "Great place lots to see",
          "I\u2019ve been coming here since i was a child and it\u2019s great. I love coming here because it contains all of manitoba\u2019s history and doesn\u2019t skim anything.

Our kids will happily spend a -40 winter day running around, picking out their favorite trilobite fossil and playing Pirates on the Nonsuch. Parking is very annoying though.",

      "name": "The Forks National Historic Site",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Forks (French: La Fourche) is a historic site, meeting place and green space in Downtown Winnipeg located at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine River. \nThe Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity. The site's 5.5-hectare (14-acre; 0.021 sq mi) grounds are open year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 6,000 years ago ===\nNumerous archaeological digs have shown that early Aboriginal groups arrived at The Forks site around 6,000 years ago. The digs conducted between 1989 and 1994 discovered several Aboriginal camps. Artifacts related to the bison hunt and fishing were unearthed. Evidence showed that Nakoda (Assiniboins), Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) and Sioux (Dakota) visited the site. Seasonal migration routes from northern forests to southern plains featured the Forks area as a rest stop, and the location became a key transcontinental trade link.The Assiniboine River has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River.\n\n\n=== 1734\u20131760 ===\nEuropean fur traders arrived at the site and initiated trade with the local peoples, using the Assiniboine people as fur trade middlemen.\n\n\n=== 1738\u20131880 ===\nEuropeans arrived by canoe in 1738. La V\u00e9rendrye erected Fort Rouge, the first of a long line of forts and trading posts erected in the area. The Red River Colony and the forts were all established near The Forks. The area remained the hub of the fur trade up until the 1880s. At that time, grain production became Western Canada\u2019s principal industry and the main transportation for that industry was rail rather than waterways.During the smallpox epidemics of 1781\u20131782, over half of the area's aboriginal population died.  At this time over 1,000 Aboriginal men, women, and children were buried in The Old Aboriginal Graveyard at The Forks.From 1760 to 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company competed for furs. Both companies used The Forks to store and ship supplies and furs. By 1821, competing fur companies were amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== 1886\u20131923 ===\nThe rail yards of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway were dominant facets of the Forks site, and this era is responsible for some of the buildings still standing at The Forks.The Forks Market was formed by joining together the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stable and the Great Northern Railway stable and Johnston Terminal was originally known as the National Cartage Building.The Manitoba Children\u2019s Museum is housed in what used to be the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company\u2019s Buildings and Bridges (B & B) Buildings. Union Station is still in operation.\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131920 ===\nAcross the Prairies the Canadian government began actively promoting immigration, settlement and railway development in the late 1800s. The Canadian government erected two immigration sheds at The Forks, each accommodating up to 500 people.\n\n\n=== The Forks today ===\n\nSince its designation in 1989, The Forks has contained public space for celebrations and recreation, an interpretive park, revitalized historic and new buildings containing shops and restaurants, as well as a skateboard park and historic port. The Forks attracts over four million visitors each year.\n\n\n== The Forks Market ==\n\nBeginning as two adjacent stables for competing rail companies, the horse stalls were joined together by a courtyard and bridges and became what is now known as The Forks Market.The Forks Market features a six storey tower with viewing platform, which is accessible by stairs or elevator and features interpretive panels with information on the site's history.\nThe market also comprises two storeys of vendors selling everything from fresh fruit, bread, meat, and wine to cigars and aromatherapy products to crafts and artworks from 300 local and Canadian artisans.In mid-2016, the Forks completed a $2.5-million renovation of the food hall into a feature called The Common, including a new beer and wine kiosk.\n\n\n== Johnston Terminal ==\n\nAcross the courtyard from the Forks Market is the four-storey Johnston Terminal building. Originally constructed in 1930, the terminal was a warehouse and freight-forwarding facility erected by Carter-Halls-Aldinger Company, and cost an estimated $134,700. After a substantial addition in 1930, the warehouse was at the time one of the largest in Winnipeg, containing over 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq ft) of usable space. It was occupied by National Storage and Cartage until 1961, and was leased to the Johnston National Cartage Company for the next 15 years.  Vacated in 1977, the building was unoccupied until the redevelopment of the site into The Forks. The original developers, Artis REIT, continue to own and manage Johnston Terminal. \nThe building is now home to a variety of specialty boutiques and stores, offices, a caf\u00e9, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. The basement of the building hosts the Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, which features over 30 consigners and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new merchandise brought in daily.\n\n\n== Travel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre ==\nTravel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre \u2013 Forks Location is the visitor information centre for Manitoba, offering travel counseling and trip planning services. The centre also acts as a meeting point for the \"6,000 Years in 60 Minutes!\" Parks Canada interpretive program offered throughout the summer months.\n\n\n== Manitoba Children's Museum ==\n\nLocated next to the Oodena Celebration Circle, the Manitoba Children's Museum is a non-profit, charitable children's museum featuring twelve permanent galleries. Originally opened at a different location in 1986, the museum's moved to its current building at the Forks in 1994. The museum is now housed in the former Kinsmen Building, which is the oldest surviving train repair facility in Manitoba, having been built in 1889.The museum underwent $10 million in renovations in 2011, including the addition of the Buhler Welcome Centre.\n\n\n== Manitoba Theatre for Young People ==\n\nThe Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults, located at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg. The location provides 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2) of space for the theatre to use towards its missions of producing entertaining professional theatre, providing training in theatre and portraying the experience of Canadian children.MTYP's Theatre School offers Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions, as well as Spring break and Summer camps, including classes for children as young as three years old. MTYP offers free acting, performing and film training classes to Winnipeg's Aboriginal youth between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\n== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ==\n\nThe Forks is the location of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (the first national museum outside of Ottawa). Its construction was completed in 2014.\nThe site for the museum is one of archaeological importance relating to First Nations history.\n\n\n== Inn at the Forks ==\n\nInn at the Forks is a five storey hotel located at the Forks. It has 117 guest rooms and suites, meeting and reception space for up to 200 people, fitness facilities, and features The Current Restaurant & Lounge and Riverstone Spa. The hotel features natural slate floors in the main lobby, glass vanities in the suite washrooms, heated floors, and a water wall in the spa.The Inn at the Forks project was the first Canadian application of the \u201cRedi-Maid\u201d system that links ensuite occupancy sensors, lighting and mechanical system controls to staff PDAs with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency. The hotel was completed with a construction cost of $16 million in May 2004.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Rail Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Rail Museum is located at the historic Union Station adjacent to the Forks. It is home to the Countess of Dufferin steam locomotive, the first locomotive to enter Western Canada.\n\n\n== Outdoor features ==\nThe Forks features numerous outdoor facilities, sculptures, and landscape features open to the public.\n\n\n=== Arctic Glacier Winter Park ===\n\nDuring winter, the following skating rinks, trails and snow park structures are erected at the Forks.\nThe Plaza Skating Rink\nAn Olympic-sized Skating Rink\nRink under Scotiabank Stage\n1.2 km of skating trails\nThe Snowboard Fun Park\nThe Toboggan Run\nIn January 2008, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized The Forks as the home of the longest skating rink in the world. The 8.54-kilometre-long Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail on the Assiniboine River and the Red River is almost 1 kilometer longer than the previous record-holding rink. The 7.8-kilometre long rink on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Ontario had lost its World Record title which it had held since 1971. Then in 2008 the rivers beat their own record which made the longest rink go to about 9.3-kilometres. The Rideau Canal still held the record for the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\". In 2013 the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail lost its record to the Lake Windermere Whiteway at Invermere, British Columbia, Canada.The length of the skating trail at The Forks changes each year, depending on river and ice conditions, although a concerted effort is made to make it as long as possible. In the winter of 2010/2011, conditions on The Assiniboine River made it impossible to safely create skating westward, so the path extended instead south on the Red River. Essentially, the water level and the weather at the time of freeze-up will impact the way the ice forms (see frazil ice, for example), how stable it will be, and how smoothly it can be made for skating. Much of the local river ice in Winnipeg in the winter of 2010/2011 was too rough to form a skating surface. There is also a skating trail made overland which is not impacted by river conditions. There are also walking and ski trails running parallel to the skating trail.\nWarming Huts: An Art + Architecture Competition on Ice is an open competition endorsed by the Manitoba Association of Architects. Started in 2010, the first iteration of the competition saw five local architects building outdoor structures to protect people from winter weather. In 2011, competition was opened up to international participants and included work by Frank Gehry's firm Gehry Partners. The competition has been awarded a Downtown Merit Award from the International Downtown Association. In January of each year, competition winners travel to Winnipeg for a week to build their warming huts, which are then relocated onto the frozen river for visitors to use. Warming huts are available until the end of the skating season. \n\n\n=== Assiniboine Riverwalk ===\n\nThe Assiniboine Riverwalk follows along the riverbanks from underneath Esplanade Riel to the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building.The Riverwalk is often closed due to river flooding in springtime. From the construction of the walkway to the summer of 2011, the walkway has been submerged beyond access for part of the summer for 16 out of 21 years.\n\n\n=== Balance of Spirit Within ===\n\"Balance of Spirit Within\" is a granite stone sculpture weighing approximately 10 tonnes, and is located on the north side of the Forks Historic Rail Bridge.\n\n\n=== Broadway Promenade ===\nThe Broadway Promenade is a pedestrian walkway connecting the Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge to Union Station and Broadway Avenue. Designed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the design incorporates two pathways which cross the site.  One pathway re-established the historic Broadway/Provencher Boulevard connection, and the other is a winding pathway representing pre-European contact era.\n\n\n=== Busk Stops ===\nThere are often buskers in and around the Forks. Buskers perform at stations known as \"Busk Stops\". They are paid by donation, but are prohibited from suggesting donation amounts or requesting contributions. There is an annual competition called the \"Scotiabank Busker's Festival\" at which it is decided who will be allowed to Busk.\n\n\n=== Esplanade Riel ===\n\nNamed in honor of Louis Riel,  Esplanade Riel is a pedestrian-only side-spar cable-stayed bridge which spans the Red River connecting downtown Winnipeg with St. Boniface, and it is paired with a vehicular bridge, the Provencher Bridge.\nThe Esplanade Riel is the only bridge with a restaurant in North America, and since July 2015 is occupied by Mon Ami Louis.  Former leasees include Salisbury House, a local Winnipeg chain restaurant, and Chez Sophie.\n\n\n=== Festival Park and Scotiabank Stage ===\nThe Scotiabank Stage is an outdoor stage with adjoining greenspace, built along the Broadway Promenade.In 2012, the signature events at the stage included Winnipeg's Pride Parade festival, Aboriginal Day Live hosted by APTN, Canada Day activities and the Folklorama Kick-Off.\n\n\n=== Flood markers ===\nThe posts on the canopy between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands on them to commemorate the peak water levels of major floods. Starting from the bottom of the posts, the bottom marker represents the 1950 flood, the middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 floods, and the top the flood of 1826. The flood line markers on one of the posts have historic plaques with information on the floods they represent.\n\n\n=== The Forks Historic Port ===\n\nPositioned along the Assiniboine Riverwalk, the historic port offers river vessel docking and rental, as well as access to the Splash Dash Water Bus.During times of flooding Splash Dash Water Bus employs a moveable ramp and floating dock system that allows it to operate in high water conditions.\n\n\n=== The Forks Market Plaza ===\nLocated directly in between the Forks Market, and Johnston Terminal, the Forks Market Plaza features fountains, canopies, dancing programs, several open performance spaces and patios.In the winter, the Plaza is home to an artificially cooled skating rink, under a canopy and lights.\n\n\n=== The Forks National Historic Site of Canada ===\nThe Forks National Historic Site of Canada is a 9.0 acre (3.63 hectare) park dedicated to \"preserving and presenting the 6,000-year history of human presence and activity at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers\", and is operated by Parks Canada.\nThe site features interpretive exhibits, sculptures, year-round walking trails, a dock, a canoe beach, a native prairie garden and a riverside amphitheatre for performances and events. Walking tours and presentations are offered throughout the summer.\n\n\n=== Historic Rail Bridge ===\nBuilt in 1888, the rail bridge was abandoned and eventually converted into a lighted crossing for pedestrians, cyclists and skaters.The mural on the side of the rail bridge is entitled \"Jackson Beardy \u2014 Woodlands Group of Seven Tribute\", and was painted in 2006 for Graffiti Gallery's Winnipeg International Mural Festival. The 30 foot wide and 20 foot tall mural pays tribute to Cree artist Jackson Beardy as well as the other members of the Indian Group of Seven.\n\n\n=== Oodena Celebration Circle ===\n\nOodena Celebration Circle is a natural shallow amphitheatre located between Johnston's Terminal, the Manitoba Children's Museum, and the Red River Riverwalk. \"Oodena\" is Cree for \"centre of the city\". Commissioned in 1993, the site was designed by the firm of Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm. The location features sculptures, a sundial, interpretive signage, a naked eye observatory and a ceremonial fire pit.The circular amphitheatre is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep. The 3 metres (9.8 ft) excavation for the site unearthed what is referred to by local archaeologists as \u201cthe archaic horizon\u201d, a 3,000-year-old layer of soil rich in artifacts.There are 8 unique steel armatures that rest on cobblestone formations surrounding the bowl.  Each armature points at a specific constellation, according to dates and times indicated on the panels surrounding the central stage.  Sighting rings on the armatures identify specific stars within the constellations. The supporting cobblestone formations bear inscriptions of various legends about the stars their armatures focus upon. The amphitheatre marks the vernal and autumnal equinox and the summer and winter solstices. \"The south armature features a shadow rod that casts solstice shadows on ground markers, the west armature is fitted with a wind sculpture, and the northeast armature features an aeolian harp.\" (Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm \u2013 Oodena Celebration Circle)The site has been used as a meeting grounds for such varied events as \"No Stone Unturned\", a free concert in honour of Manitoba's missing and murdered women, as well as the 2011 opening night location for THIN AIR, the Winnipeg International Writers Festival and as the meeting location for Winnipeg's Zombie Walk 2012.\n\n\n=== Pan Am Games Monument ===\n\nThe Forks is home to the 1999 Pan Am Games Monument. Located beside the Inn at the Forks, the monument recognizes the governments, companies and individuals who supported the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The monument served as the flame cauldron for the games.The 1999 Pan Am Games mainstage concerts were held at the Scotiabank Stage and Festival Park.\n\n\n=== Peace Meeting Site ===\nThe \"Peace Meeting Site\" is a landscaped resting area along the Broadway Promenade, featuring Aboriginal and European elements, notable for having two gigantic Adirondack chairs.\n\n\n=== Prairie Garden ===\nThe Forks has a Prairie Garden, which is a natural wild garden with over 10,000 plants in over 150 native plant species, including 38 prairie plants such as prairie crocus, wild iris, bergamot, purple prairie clover and wild columbine.\n\n\n=== Public Orchard ===\nIn collaboration with Winnipeg-CORE, the public orchard at The Forks contains 61 fruit trees including apple, apricot, cherry, pear, and plum, which the public can pick to eat from when the fruit is ripe. There are as many as 75 fruit bearing shrubs packed with all types of berries to pick from during the summer days.\nThere are also many education sessions through Winnipeg-CORE that are open to the public, as part of The Fork's Target Zero initiative.\n\n\n=== Rail cars ===\n\nJust outside The Forks Market are two completely restored turn of the century rail cars. One car is for display, while the other is home to \"Sugar Mountain Express\", a candy store.\n\n\n=== Skatepark ===\n\nOfficially opened 30 June 2006, \"The Plaza\" is the largest urban skate plaza and bowl complex in Canada. Announced in 2005, it was built with money donated from the J.W. Burns Family Foundation. The skatepark includes a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, and an 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) 'bowl complex'.The design features 'skateable' artwork, and is built to tolerate the regular use and enjoyment of skateboarders and cyclists.

        "wiki": "Leonid Molodozhanyn, known as Leo Mol,  (January 15, 1915 \u2013 July 4, 2009) was a Ukrainian Canadian stained glass artist, painter and sculptor.\n\n\n== History ==\nBorn Leonid Molodozhanyn in Polonne, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and raised in Russia (Krasnoyarsk, Prokhladny, Nalchik and Leningrad), Mol learned the art of ceramics in his father's pottery workshop. As a young man, he wanted to study painting in Vienna and spent several years studying there under the tutelage of Wilhelm Frass. With Frass's recommendation, Mol was then hired by the sculptor Frans Klimsh, who would support his application to the Berlin Academy. Mol also studied sculpture at the Leningrad Academy of Arts from 1936 to 1940.Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union he deported to Germany where he was influenced by Arno Breker. In 1945, he moved to The Hague, and in December, 1948, he and his wife, Margareth (whom he married in 1943), emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1948. In 1949, he held his first ceramics exhibition in Winnipeg.\nMol was known for his sculptures of square dancers, skiers, aboriginals, and wildlife. Mol also completed more than 80 stained-glass windows in churches throughout Winnipeg.\nMore than three hundred of Mol's works are displayed in the 1.2 hectare Leo Mol Sculpture Garden in Winnipeg's Assiniboine Park which comprises a gallery, a renovated studio, and an outdoor display.  The garden was unveiled on June 18, 1992 and has been expanded twice since.  It is supported by private donations, and Mol personally donated 200 bronze sculptures to the city of Winnipeg. The sculptures are of religious leaders, prominent people, the human form, and wildlife. \nMol died July 4, 2009, at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  He was 94.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2002, his monumental bronze sculpture Lumberjacks (1990), which now stands in Assiniboine Park was featured on a 48\u00a2 Canadian postage stamp in the sculptors series. Mol's small bronze sculpture of lumberjacks (1978) was his inspiration for a monumental bronze sculpture.He was always known as a particularly prolific artist and some of his most famous works include likenesses of three different Popes which stand in museums in the Vatican.  He also has a sculpture of Taras Shevchenko on display on Washington\u2019s Embassy Row.Other important subjects who Mol sculpted include members of the Group of Seven, A. J. Casson, A.Y. Jackson and Frederick Varley. Mol also sculpted Sir Winston Churchill 1966, Winnipeg editorial cartoonist Peter Kuch (1917-1980), Dwight D. Eisenhower 1965, John F. Kennedy 1969, Elizabeth Bradford Holbrook ca. 1970, Terry Fox 1982. On Parliament Hill in Ottawa stands his impressive over life-size standing portrait figure of Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker 1985 Also on Parliament Hill stands an impressive bronze statue of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe maquette of Sir William Stephenson C.C. (code-named \"Intrepid\") is displayed in a place of honour within CIA Headquarters, Langley, VA, USA\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1989, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was awarded the Order of Manitoba. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.He received honorary degrees from the University of Winnipeg, the University of Alberta and the University of Manitoba.Mol was also made an honorary academician of the Canadian Portrait Academy (Hon. CPA) in 2000.Leo Mol's papers are held by the University of Manitoba Archives and Special Collections.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ukrainian Weekly article:The extraordinary success story of sculptor Leo Mol\nBronze sculptor Leo Mol dies at 94, remembered for his passion for art, Winnipeg\nLeo Mol biography\nWatch Leo Mol in Light and Shadow at NFB.ca\nStained Glass in the Cathedral of Sts.

        "wiki": "Assiniboine Park (formerly known as City Park) is a park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Winnipeg Public Parks Board was formed in 1893, and purchased the initial land for the park in 1904. Although in use before then, the park officially opened in 1909, and is located north of the Assiniboine Forest, along the Assiniboine River. It is named for the Assiniboine people. The park covers 1,100 acres (450 ha), of which 400 acres (160 ha) are designed in the English landscape style.\nThe park includes the 700-acre (280 ha) Assiniboine Forest, Assiniboine Park Zoo, Assiniboine Park Conservatory, the historic Assiniboine Park Pavilion, formal and informal gardens, a sculpture garden, a miniature railway, an outdoor theatre for performing arts, and numerous other attractions. \n\n\n== Prominent attractions ==\n\n\n=== Conservatory and gardens ===\nOne of the earliest park features and a major indoor attraction, The Conservatory is a botanical garden housing more than 8,000 flowers, plants and trees that are non-native to Manitoba, but which grow profusely under the ideal conditions created in the Palm House and Display Garden. The original Palm House was erected in 1914, and in 1968 a fully modern structure was built over and around the Palm House, enclosing it.It was announced in early 2018 that the Assiniboine Park Conservatory would close permanently in April 2018 due to ongoing renovation costs and it reaching the end of its \"useful life\". The building has since been demolished, and usage of the existing space has not been determined. In 2018 a group of citizens spoke out about the future Diversity Gardens, that visitors will have to pay an admission fee like at the Zoo, and that this will cause lower income citizens to be unable to afford to visit the new displays.Known throughout North America for its luxuriant display of thousands of annual and perennial flowers, the English Garden (established between 1926 and 1927) contains nearly three acres of flowers, shrubs and trees arranged in the traditional English style. From the outset, the English Garden was designed to serve as a popular park attraction where local residents and tourists could obtain information about specialized floriculture in Manitoba. New plant varieties have been introduced annually. A large rose garden (with more than 400 bushes (there are only a few remnants of roses in this area.) of Floribunda, Grandiflora and Rugosa varieties), broken into four sections, surrounds a central, fish-filled lily pond. (No roses exist in this area, the central pond has a large fountain in it, no fish or lilies exist.)\nThe English Garden is open free of charge to the public every day of the year.\nThe Formal Garden, located at the southeast park entrance, was designed in 1907 by Frederick Todd as part of the original park. It features flower beds in sharply defined geometric shapes that stand out from the grassy areas. Each of the beds, as well as the overall design, is symmetrical.The Leo Mol Sculpture Garden displays more than three hundred works by Dr. Leo Mol, including bronze and ceramic sculptures, paintings and drawings. Opened in 1992, the sculpture garden has been expanded twice since.\n\n\n=== Pavilion and theatre ===\n\nThe park's signature feature, the Assiniboine Park Pavilion became a focus of early Winnipeg's social life. Originally designed by John D. Atchison and built in 1908, it included a dance hall, a banquet hall, lunch and catering. The 90-foot (27 m) tower contained the pump and water tower for the park's water system. It was destroyed by fire in May 1929. The current larger pavilion was designed by architects Northwood and Chivers, and was opened in May 1930. It is today one of Winnipeg's most familiar landmarks.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre is a large outdoor stage located next to the Pavilion.  Opened in 1999, it carries on the tradition of bandshell entertainment near the Pavilion that started in the 1920s.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe  90 acres (36 ha) Assiniboine Park Zoo is at the western end of the park just North of the main parking area, and is home to over 300 animal species. It initially opened in July 1908.\n\n\n=== Foot Bridge ===\nThe first foot bridge was built in 1908 when the Park had initially opened. However, in later years it was determined that a wider and safer bridge would be needed.\nA second bridge, connecting the suburb of St. James (at Overdale St.) with Assiniboine Park is an active transportation/pedestrian bridge, and officially opened in May 1932 by Winnipeg Mayor Ralph Webb.\n\n\n=== Duck Pond ===\n\nToward the north of the park, and just to one side of the pedestrian footbridge from Portage Avenue is the serpentine Duck Pond. Originally a fenced area, in the 2010s the Duck Pond was upgraded with new plants and benches. Although called a duck pond, it is more common to find Canada geese swimming there.\n\n\n=== Children's Nature and Adventure Playground ===\nOpened in May 2011 as part of the Park's redevelopment, a 0.81 ha (2-acre) Children's Nature and Adventure Playground was built as a children's play area. It is located adjacent to the Pavilion and cost $6 million. The play area features a kid-size doorway, although adult throughway is also provided. The relocated Winnie the Pooh statue is inside the Nature Playground area.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAdjacent to Roblin Boulevard, the last steam locomotive to run scheduled service in Canada, CNR 6043, Class U-1-d, 4-8-2, is on permanent display courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum.  A 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railway named Assiniboine Park Railroad operates in one section of the park, which features a working steam locomotive made by Crown Metal Products.  Additionally, a private rideable miniature railway named the Assiniboine Valley Railway, with a track gauge of 7 1\u20442 in (190.5 mm), is located outside the park near the zoo.\nThe park also includes picnic areas.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe park offers playgrounds, a bicycle path, baseball and cricket fields with three cricket pitches (upper and lower grounds) and a clubhouse on site. The park is the Manitoba Cricket League's premier facility for hosting club cricket. (Turf wickets are going to be installed on the cricket field and used for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2012).\nThe Terry Fox Fitness Trail, dedicated to the Canadian humanitarian's memory, is designed for disabled and non-disabled individuals alike. Assiniboine Park is wheelchair-accessible.\n\n\n== Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project ==\nThe Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project strives to help the riparian forest bounce back from heavy use and enhance the recreational trail experience. The ongoing riverbank restoration project, begun in 2006, continues each summer.The project concerns the strip of forest along the Assiniboine River within Assiniboine Park, a well-known and much-loved recreational area just east of the footbridge on the south side of Portage Avenue. Over many years, the forest has suffered a loss of vegetation due to flooding, invasive plant species that replace native species, and trampling from recreational activities such as hiking and biking. Generations of heavy usage has resulted in the creation of an extensive trail network, soil compaction and large areas of bare ground.Restoration is underway in the forest through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\nWinnipeg arts and culture\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSpector, David (2019).

      "name": "Manitoba Legislative Building",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Manitoba Legislative Building (French: Palais l\u00e9gislatif du Manitoba) is the meeting place of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, in central Winnipeg.  It was originally named the Manitoba Parliament Building, not Legislative.  The neoclassical building was completed in 1920 and stands 77 metres tall (253 ft).  It was designed and built by Frank Worthington Simon (1862\u20131933) and Henry Boddington III, along with other masons and many skilled craftsmen.  The building is famous for the Golden Boy, a gold covered bronze statue based on the style of the Roman god Mercury, or the Greek god Hermes, at the top of the cupola, or domed ceiling.\n\n\n== History and construction ==\n\nIn 1911, the Manitoba government announced an architectural competition to all architects in the British Empire. A grand prize of $10,000 was offered for the best design for the new Manitoba Legislative Building. It is the third building used by Manitoba's legislative assembly, the first being the home of A.G.B. Bannatyne, while the second stood on the same grounds as the current Legislative building. Of the 67 submissions, Frank Worthington Simon, a former student at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, had his design chosen for the construction of the impressive structure.Construction began in 1913, with Tyndall stone, quarried at Garson, about 20 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. On June 3, 1914 the north-east cornerstone ceremony, which was commonly done by masons, was laid by Thomas Kelly, the contractor.  Kelly stole many of the materials to build his own house three blocks away, so the construction of the massive building was slowed and was not ready for partial occupancy until 1919. On July 15, 1920, the province's 50th anniversary date, opening ceremonies were performed by Sir James Aikins, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.The base of the building forms the letter H. The total square footage of the building is 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2), with a total height of 242 feet (74 m) above ground level topped with a bronze statue, gilded with 23.75 k gold leaf, of the Greek God Hermes or the Roman God Mercury. The Legislative grounds cover 30 acres (120,000 m2) of landscaped grounds. Throughout the exterior and interior of the building are examples of Fibonacci Sequence, Golden Ratio and Sacred Geometry.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\nOn the north side of the Legislative Building, above the 6 main columns, is the main pediment. In the bottom-left corner of the pediment is the Indolent Man, with a half-kneeling woman, the spirit of progress, beckoning the Indolent Man into the new land of promise. Next is the goddess Europa leading a bull, symbolizing Canada's European heritage and immigration.  To the right of Europa, a man, woman and child symbolizing the colonization of a new land. Seated in the centre is Lady Manitoba with the rays of the sun behind her.  Lady Manitoba closely resembles the fertility goddesses Ishtar and Demeter, both patron deities of agriculture. To the west is Neptune's trident symbolizing the Pacific Ocean, to the east is a ship\u2019s wheel symbolizing the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent to Lady Manitoba are a man and a woman laden with wheat and fruit, products of the soil.  Next is a muscular male figure with a team of powerful horses and a primitive plough tilling the soil. Finally in the bottom right corner are two entwined female figures representing the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.Above the main pediment, flanking both sides are two Egyptian sphinxes facing both east and west. Carved onto a flat piece of stone, just below the chin, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, is \"The everlasting manifestation of the Sun God Ra, the good God who gives life.\"\nOn both the east and west porticos sit figures representing war and peace. On the east side, with engraved images of weapons of war, are two male figures, one a native warrior with an eagle head-dress, another a Roman soldier, and on the west side there are two female figures for peace. Each pair guards a chest, rumoured to represent the Ark of the Covenant because of the proper proportions as mentioned in the ancient Hebrew texts.\nOn the grounds of the Legislative Building, facing the Assiniboine River, there is the Louis-Riel sculpture by Miguel Joyal. It was erected in 1996 and commemorates M\u00e9tis leader Louis Riel.\n\n\n== The Golden Boy ==\n\nEach one of the four corners of the copper dome supporting the Golden Boy has a stonework grouping representing the four elements of alchemy, earth, air, fire and water. They are identified as Agriculture, Science, Industry and Art. The dome is 223 feet 7 inches (68.15 m) above the main floor. The height of the central tower without the Golden Boy is 242 feet (74 m).  The statue was first installed in 1919, originally called Eternal Youth, and sculpted by Parisian artist Georges Gardet. The Golden Boy was last regilded and refurbished in 2002, and is illuminated by floodlights.\n\n\n== Grand Staircase ==\n\nWithin the main entrance is the Grand Staircase.  This is a perfectly square room measuring 66.6 feet (20.3 m) on each side, which is meant to represent the numerological number 666, which are all the numbers added from one to 36, which is the square of 6, in mathematics, geometry, and arithmetic. The staircase is composed of three flights of steps each with 13 steps. The steps are brown-veined Carrara marble, the finest marble in the world.  Flanking the steps are life size North American bison. Made of solid bronze, they were modelled by Georges Gardet, creator of the Golden Boy, and cast at the Roman Bronze Works in New York City. Each bison weighs 2,268 kilograms (2\u00bd tons). Legend has it that to install the bison safely without damaging the marble floors, the main entrance was flooded and left to freeze. Both bison were then placed on enormous slabs of ice cut from the Assiniboine River, and safely slid into the building. The bison are one example of apotropaic icons in the Grand Staircase.\nThe bison, a symbol of the Province of Manitoba, are meant to represent the sacred bulls which guard temple entrances. Above the south entrance to the legislature lobby is the Medusa's head, and over the north entrance facing Medusa is the bust of Athena, Greek goddess of war, embodiment of democracy and also the protector of cities.  Around the perimeter of the room are 14 lion heads and 8 cattle skulls at the edge of the ceiling.  Around the second floor balcony, lamps rise from the balustrades, each containing 13 bulbs, 12 around 1 (Twelve Apostles and Jesus). The third floor facing the Grand Staircase is supported by two pairs of columns, reproductions of the caryatids, sculpted female figures serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar. Each figure holds a scroll and key. The figures located on the third floor were carved by the Piccirilli Brothers of New York, using models prepared by Albert Hodge of London, England. The ceiling is made of a glass atrium to allow natural sunlight to illuminate the room.\n\n\n== Rotunda ==\n\nThe antechamber at the head of the grand staircase provides a formal approach to the legislative chamber. 8 Corinthian columns rise from the floor to the cornice surrounding the base of the dome. Between each pair of columns are busts of Hermes. The floor of the dome rotunda is Tennessee marble bordered with black Vermont and verde antique marble. The height to the eye of the dome is 87 feet (27 m) and the diameter is 54 feet (16 m). Within the dome above are four panels containing 5 gold rosettes.\n\nIn the centre of the Rotunda is an Italian marble balustrade 13 feet (4.0 m) across surrounding the Pool of the Black Star on the floor of the level below, a representation of the altars of the ancient Greeks.  The diameter of the circle above the balustrade is also 13 feet (4.0 m), and both align with the Golden Boy above these.  Above the doorway to the Manitoba Assembly is a mural by Frank Brangwyn depicting World War I. In the centre of the painting is a man in tattered rags with his left chest and arm exposed, being helped along by a comrade. Above the men are a faint depiction of The Madonna and child.\n\n\n== Pool of the Black Star ==\n\nThe Pool of the Black Star is the room below the Rotunda with four entrances and marked by 3 steps forming a circumference of the room. The room is circular with a radius of 27 feet (8.2 m). At the centre of the floor is an 8-pointed black marble star. Directly above in alignment with the Pool of the Black Star is the dome of the building, on which the Golden Boy is mounted. The design of the building allows sounds from all over the building to be caught and heard in the circular room, and echoes can be heard by speaking in the room.\n\n\n== Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room ==\nIn the east corridor of the Manitoba Legislative Building is the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room. This finely decorated room is used by the Lieutenant-Governor on state occasions to receive visiting royalty and foreign dignitaries and general public is barred from entry. During such events, scarlet-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police are posted on either side of the door and military aides assist the Lieutenant-Governor with official duties. The room is panelled in black American walnut inlaid with ebony, and decorated with hand-carved ornaments around the ceiling and along the four corner pillars.  Pictures of sovereigns grace the walls and a French gilt chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The floor features a carpet specially hand-woven in Donegal, Ireland. Facing across from each other on the north and south wall are two elaborate mirrors in gilt frames. The room measures 24 feet (7.3 m) in both directions. Directly above the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room are the two male warriors (War), one native in full eagle feathered head dress, and one Roman, guarding the representation of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\n\n== Legislative Chamber ==\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Lieutenant Governor form the Legislature of Manitoba, the legislative branch of government in the Canadian Province of Manitoba. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly in provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting. Originally, in 1870, there were 24 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).  As the province grew in population and size, more electoral divisions were added.  Winnipeg was once the third largest city in Canada, and often called Chicago of the North.Manitoba's Legislative chamber is unique among Provincial Legislatures in that the Members' benches are grouped in a horseshoe shape. The Speaker of the House's chair is located on the south wall below the press gallery of 13 seats.  All debate is addressed to the Speaker, who rules on points of order and procedure and has the responsibility of maintaining order and decorum.\nWhen the Legislature is in session, each day begins in accordance with procedures that have origins in the early beginnings of Parliamentary rule. The speaker enters the Legislative Chamber followed by the clerks of the Legislative Assembly and preceded by the Sergeant-at-arms bearing Manitoba's Mace.The original desks and chairs of the Chamber are fashioned of walnut with inlaid ebony. They are arranged in three tiers rising from a sunken floor in the centre of the Chamber. Each desk is equipped with a microphone connected to a public address system and a recording machine used in the publication of Hansard, a verbatim report of debates and proceedings in the Legislature. During question period, translators provide simultaneous translation from French to English. The Chamber is also equipped for video and internet broadcasts of question period and special events such as throne and budget speeches. Yet even as such changes have brought the assembly into the future, the original inkwells employed by an earlier generation of Manitoban politicians are still visible. To the right of the speaker is a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, to the left is Solon, a famous lawmaker of ancient Athens. Each statue is made of bronze and sculpted by Gardet.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe cost of reconstruction today would be prohibitive, due to such factors as a shortage of skilled masons.In 2014, the local government stressed about the state of deterioration of the building to the level of life safety concerns. Tree roots, insects and bird feces are identified as the main threats to the building's longevity.In March 2015, a military hall of honour opened in the Manitoba Legislative Building commemorating the Manitoba's regiments who fought World War I. In May 2017, Rick Hansen (CEO of the Rick Hansen Institute) criticized the accessibility of the building after Independent MA Steven Fletcher gave him an official tour.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMarilyn Baker (1986).

          "Golden boy does not disappoint. My family, along with my sister's, visited on 12 Dec 2019 and the whole area was lit with festive lights! It was a cold but a romantic and lovely night --- perfect ambiance for the incoming year 2020. I always return for the regal yet relax",

          "A beautiful building with amazing stairways and marble floors. The architect was a mason and puts lots of quirky and interesting symbols within the building. All flights of stairs are in 13s. There\u2019s an area with a star within a circle n the middle of the floor. If you stand on",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the legislative building, though we did not get to sit in on any of the sessions. There are booklets that tell you about the different displays and areas as well as the architecture. Visitors go thru security on entry.",
          "The history of its construction is amazing and just a little out of this world. A guided tour will provide an enriched experience. The stonework, the woodwork, the pink marble floors ... walk slowly and look closely ... beautiful",

          "This place is open everyday of the year. The architecture is amazing inside and out. Lots of hidden meanings and symbols in the carvings and statues. It would be best to get tour from knowledgable guide or research prior to visiting. Amazing place for photos.",
          "Gorgeous, well manicured, clean, no littering and the public treats the area well. Other cities can learn how the lake is incorporated with the leg grounds and people can enjoy both at the same time, spent many hours walking and enjoying. Will always return",
          "If you just go in (you need an official ID) you will see the interesting architecture, buffalos, and the echo chamber. But if you bring a guide, you can hear interesting \u201cfacts\u201d about Free Mason references (which seem far fetched).",
          "Reasonably priced and very informative. Our seniors' rate beat the Groupon Offer's price. We were unable to fit our European visitors into their published schedule, so they were able to take us on a 'private' tour at their published rates. Informative and interesting. I don't",
          "I attended a tour of the legislative building. There where interesting points to the tour but it seemed somewhat limited in scope. There is a lunch room available to the public and ample bathrooms. It is easy to get lost.",

          "We were opportune to visit Manitoba State Legislative building at Winnipeg. It is a big building constructed in 1920, almost a 100 years ago. The entrance has 6 pillars and the other 3 sides have 4 pillars in each side. It has taken almost 7-8 years to finish the construction",
          "We took a tour of the Manitoba legislative building with Frank Albo on a Wednesday night, the only night he does the tour (and there is a reason for that - go and find out why). So much information and so much passion. I wish I could go many more times so I could absorb",

          "You can go with a tour or explore on your own. Architectural fans will be in love. Learn the history of Winnipeg and explore the park surrounding the building and the gardens. There are original elevators for easy access.",
          "As we were here before the summer guided tours began, we were allowed to wander the building by ourselves. There was a printed guide to point out some of the amazing stories behind the building. The spaces here are amazing and cannot imagine anything being built like it again.",
          "We went after 8 pm so got cheap parking. Bld closes at 8 pm. I think the hours were 8am-8pm. Bld amazing outside. Being Metis it was a emotional visit to see Metis statute of Louis Riel on the South side of the building.",

          "The Legislative Building is free to enter. You pass thru security (incl a bag search) - all very professional and friendly. You are free to take photos. There are free guided tours but i just did self-guided. You cant go into any rooms except the library but theres good history",
          "Striking building, but it is not overly special. Grounds are pretty, but average. Saskatchewan Legislative Building is far more impressive and has stunning grounds in Wascana park.",
          "The Manitoba Legislative building is an incredible historic site. A public treasure. This building is so much more than government offices. With stunning architecture and a multitude of gorgeous sculptural and painted works, it acts like a public museum. Go and walk around, you",
          "Tour guides help tourists see details that otherwise remain undetected - and tours are offered in both Official Languages.",

        "wiki": "Winnipeg ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America.\nThe city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2016, Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500. Being far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F).Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWinnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as \"The Forks\". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.Sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the M\u00e9tis because of sharing a traditional culture.\n\nLord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M\u00e9tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.In 1869\u201370, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of M\u00e9tis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. M\u00e9tis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1900\u2013present) ===\nBy 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.\n\nMore than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled \"Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise\" (commonly known as the \"Golden Boy\"). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nIn the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan \"unicity\" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011, in each of these floods, the Red River Floodway was used to safely protect the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWinnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of 464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around \u221216.4 \u00b0C (2.5 \u00b0F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in). Temperatures occasionally drop below \u221240.0 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F). The actual air temperature drops below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) on average 12.6 days annually and rises above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) 13.3 days of the year. On average there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average. With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city in Canada. Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over 51 centimetres (20 in). Thunderstorms are very common during summer, and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. Low wind chill values are a common occurrence in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as \u221257 \u00b0C (\u221270.6 \u00b0F) and on average there are twelve days of the year that can reach a wind chill below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F).The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was 42.2 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily low temperature was 28.3 \u00b0C (82.9 \u00b0F) on 12 July 1936. The apparent heat can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity, and on 25 July 2007 a humidex reading of 47.3 \u00b0C (117.1 \u00b0F) was measured.The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe winters. The last spring frost is on average around 23 May, whilst the first fall frost is on 22 September.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThere are officially 236 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg. Downtown Winnipeg, the city's financial heart and economic core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street. It covers about 1 square mile (2.6 km2) and is the city's fastest growing high-income neighbourhood. More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges. The past few decades have seen the downtown undergo major revitalization efforts; since 1999, over C$1.2 billion has been invested.Downtown Winnipeg's Exchange District is named after the area's original grain exchange, which operated from 1880 to 1913. The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures, Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square. Other major downtown areas are The Forks, Central Park, Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown. Many of Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway.Residential neighbourhoods surround the downtown in all directions; expansion is greatest to the south and west, although several areas remain underdeveloped. The city's largest park, Assiniboine Park, houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Other large city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park. The city's major commercial areas are Polo Park, Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan), Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre, Osborne Village, and the Corydon strip. The main cultural and nightlife areas are the Exchange District, The Forks, Osborne Village and Corydon Village (both in Fort Rouge), Sargent and Ellice Avenues (West End) and Old St. Boniface. Osborne Village is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood and one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in Western Canada.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of the Canada 2016 Census there were 705,244 people living in Winnipeg proper, with approximately 778,489 living in the Winnipeg Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). Thus, Winnipeg is Manitoba's largest city and Canada's seventh largest city. Furthermore, the city represents 54.9% of the population of the province of Manitoba, the highest population concentration in one city of any province in Canada. Apart from the city of Winnipeg, the Winnipeg CMA includes the rural municipalities of Springfield, St. Clements, Tach\u00e9, East St. Paul, Macdonald, Ritchot, West St. Paul, Headingley, the Brokenhead 4 reserve, Rosser and St. Fran\u00e7ois Xavier. Statistics Canada's estimate of the Winnipeg CMA population as of 1 July 2017 is 825,713, making it the 7th largest CMA in Canada.\nAs of the 2006 census, 48.3 percent of residents were male and 51.7 percent were female. 24.3 percent were 19 years old or younger, 27.4 percent were between 20 and 30 years old, and 34.0 percent were between 40 and 64 years old. The average age of a Winnipegger in May 2006 was 38.7, compared to an average of 39.5 for Canada as a whole. Between the censuses of 2006 and 2011, Winnipeg's population increased by 4.8 percent, compared to 5.2 percent for Manitoba as a whole.

It is the only major city between Vancouver and Thunder Bay with direct US connections by rail.Winnipeg is the largest and best connected city within Manitoba, and has highways leading in all directions from the city. To the south, Winnipeg is connected to the United States via Provincial Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75) (a continuation of I-29 and US 75, known as Pembina Highway or Route 42 within Winnipeg). The highway runs 107 km (66 mi) to Emerson, Manitoba, and is the busiest Canada\u2013United States border crossing on the Prairies. The four-lane Perimeter Highway, built in 1969, serves as a Ring Road, with at-grade intersections and a few interchanges. It allows travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway to bypass the city.

The Trans-Canada Highway runs east to west through the city (city route), or circles around the city on the Perimeter Highway (beltway). Some of the city's major arterial roads include Route 80 (Waverley St.), Route 155 (McGillivray Blvd), Route 165 (Bishop Grandin Blvd.), Route 17 (Chief Peguis Trail), and Route 90 (Brookside Blvd., Oak Point Hwy., King Edward St., Century St., Kenaston Blvd.).\n\nThe Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport completed a $585-million redevelopment in October 2011.

Research facilities are also operated through hospitals and private biotechnology companies in the city.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nWater and sewage services are provided by the city. The city draws its water via an aqueduct from Shoal Lake, treating and fluoridating it at the Deacon Reservoir just outside the city prior to pumping it into the Winnipeg system. The city's system has over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) of underground water mains, which are subject to breakage during extreme weather conditions.Electricity and natural gas are provided by Manitoba Hydro, a provincial crown corporation headquartered in the city; it uses primarily hydroelectric power. The primary telecommunications carrier is MTS, although other corporations offer telephone, cellular, television and internet services.\nWinnipeg contracts out several services to private companies, including garbage and recycling collection and street plowing and snow removal. This practice represents a significant budget expenditure and is more expansive than in comparable communities. The services have faced numerous complaints from residents in 2013\u201314 about missed service.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\n \nCanadian Forces Base Winnipeg, co-located at the airport, is home to many flight operations support divisions and several training schools. It is also the headquarters of 1 Canadian Air Division and the Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Region, as well as the home base of 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces. The Wing comprises three squadrons and six schools; it also provides support to the Central Flying School. Excluding the three levels of government, 17 Wing is the fourth largest employer in the city. The Wing supports 113 units, stretching from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan\u2013Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel to the high Arctic. 17 Wing also acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter-bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.There are two squadrons based in the city.

In addition, 435 Squadron is the only Royal Canadian Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct tactical air-to-air refueling of fighter aircraft.For many years, Winnipeg was the home of the Second Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Initially, the battalion was based at the Fort Osborne Barracks, now the location of the Rady Jewish Community Centre. They eventually moved to the Kapyong Barracks between River Heights and Tuxedo. Since 2004, the battalion has operated out of CFB Shilo near Brandon.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n Media related to Winnipeg at Wikimedia Commons\n Winnipeg travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "The WAG is a great place to spend an hour or so with very young children. I visited with my three-and-a-half year old granddaughter and we had a blast. We happened to visit during the Art in Bloom exhibit so there were plenty of bright displays. I love the roof top best of all",
          "Special Impressionists exhibit for the summer. There were lots of other works as well...one highlighting women artists in Canada....Inuit artists and their works. There is a lovely gift shop on the main floor and free tea, compliments of the gift shop. New addition is in",
          "While we enjoying wandering through the exhibits, our favorite part of the day was all the art in the gift shop. There is a room full of floor-to-ceiling art work mounted on sliding panels. There are 100's of paintings to look at (and all are available for purchase). I would",
          "A very nice permanent collection and many very interesting rotating exhibits. A must in Winnipeg for all ages. Best time to go is 11:00 a.m. to avoid a crowd.",
          "A great space to see some of the great works of the Impressionists. Also don't miss the exhibition of Inuit Art",
          "We were here 8 years ago, and were happy to return. Right now (summer, 2018), there are several great special exhibitions running. The Impressionist show is superb, the Canadian Women Artists (1900-1960) is also really good, and everything else on show is worth seeing. The WAG",
          "Another iconic experience that lets Winnipeg punch way above its weight. We saw the Summer Impressionists - most of it from the Brooklyn Museum, but embellished with some wonderful WAG pieces, and it was beautifully-curated. And the Gallery is the perfect venue for it. A",
          "I have visited the Winnipeg Art Gallery many times as the travelling exhibits change frequently. It is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon, always interesting, stimulating, and enjoyable. I have often purchased something unique in the gift shop as a gift or for myself.",
          "I would rate this gallery as a 2 star when there are non special exhibits taking place, However, that goes up to a 4 when they have exhibits such as the Impressionists, Picasso, or Andy Warhol. Try to book your visit when they have a guest curator giving a tour of the exhibit",
          "Unfortunately I visited during a period in between exhibitions so it was half priced. However, there were several exhibits to study with sufficient evidence to indicate a Gallery visit is a 'must' when at full capacity. Regular Admission prices are sensible unlike some other",
          "Great place to find alot about the history and people of Winnipeg and Manitoba! Plan to spend at least a half of a day here;-}",
          "I visited to see Insurgence Resurgence - an important exhibition of contemporary Indigenous art. The show covers a large part of the third floor and includes art in all mediums. It is an interesting and engaging exhibition. Nice to see the WAG stretching their audiences. I",
          "I enjoyed the collection they had on display native and Inuit art. And their standard collection. Both were a nice mix of different media and age. The gallery itself waa laid out nicely to move through the exhibits easily. And wished i would be around for their next exhibit of",
          "For the size of this city, the Winnipeg Art Gallery is a beautiful place to visit. The building itself is very interesting. The art collection is excellent with a large collection of Inuit art. The Special Art Exhibits that come to this gallery arrive from all over the world.",
          "What a space! So much well designed open space, great for a walk and talk with a friend. And the art is so thoughtfully curated too. They are renovating the food area and there is a HUGE new area being built. Great place when it all comes in.",
          "Very impressed with not only the layout but the content as well. Especially the focus on Indigenous art in their gallery. Highly recommend taking the time to visit this Gallery if you are in town. Well worth the visit.",
          "I was highly impressed with the variety of Indigenous art in their new gallery. They even have a place where one can get an Indigenous tattoo. The four black hoods were a little out there.",
          "David Atlmejd : The vessel is totally amazing. You cannot even explain the feeling and emotion you have when see this piece. The flow of beauty in incredible. It is a must see several time because you will see something new every time you see it. Teva Harrison, In Between",

          "I love this place. I got married here once, I raised my kids here on rainy Saturday mornings, dragging them all truculent and reluctant...and once in a blue moon, in awe... part strange displays of stuff they didn't understand. I had life-altering discussions in the",
          "Fun collection and an eclectic building. We were traveling Highway 1 and needed a break. Art museums feel a lot about a city plus are super relaxing. Nice break from the highway.",
          "It is a really small art museum with not many exhibits. However I discovered Canadian painters I did not know and I really liked the emphasis on Native Canadian artists. The shop is also really nice. A must go if you are looking for special gifts for your friends and family.",
          "Very well organized. We had an awesome time going through all the beautiful pieces. We would love to come again.",
          "Worth a visit to see the wide range of artwork from a range of different people and cultures, both ancient and modern.",
          "Excellent art exhibits and beautiful space. The restaurant/venue at the top level is stunning in the summer with a beautiful patio/outdoor area (sublime for weddings and functions). The wag is a must see at any time of the year.",
          "The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) is a landmark building in downtown Winnipeg. The limestone fa\u00e7ade and sharp angles make it one of the most beautiful buildings in the city. It houses a variety of permanent collections as well as temporary exhibits. There is a rooftop patio",
          "I took some artsy friends of mine here and they had a wonderful time all the displays were well lit and easy to see and there was lots to see just a great way to spend an afternoon",
          "The callery is modern and has a range of art on display. I will probably meet most tastes. Unfortunately I was a day late for the Picasso exhibition, but what was on show was engaging and interesting. If you are in Winnipeg, it is well worth a stop off at the Gallery.",
          "This Gallery is more than 105 years old!! It is centrally located-- near the U of Winnipeg and the Parliament Building. Its collection is very large, diverse and interesting!! It is a \"definite must see\" if you are interested in culture and the aRTS!!",
          "We went on Terry Fox day to see the Picasso Exhibit and decided to check out the other galleries while there. They were completely empty which was awesome! We went to the Picasso and it was so full but still enjoyable. I even tried my hand at the draw your own Picasso activity.",

          "Saw two presentations of Picasso's work, mostly etchings. It was nicely curated, and sorted in an inspirational setting. Nice permanent collection, too, especially Inuit Art.",
          "The exhibit features a timeline of his life and work and includes incredible paintings, sketches and porcelain pieces. Supporting videos take you into the mind of this master and the inspiration for his works.",
          "When we saw that they had a special exhibition of Picasso works for the summer, it sealed the deal for us - we had to go in! As a facility, this gallery has ginormous display areas, ideal for special shows and really big works of art. At first, we thought there would be a",
          "While the WAG has many galleries,the best are the ones where they rotate the collection and show out of town exhibits. Right now, they have TWO Picasso exhibits. Great to see them all.",
          "Went to see Picasso exhibition as well as other exhibits. Small museum and was disappointed in Picasso as well as the additional charge.",
          "We were invited for a private tour led by the WAG head curator, to see the brand new Picasso in Canada and Man Beast Exhibits, and they were spectacular! I've been to a few art galleries and museums, and I always enjoy myself, but I had never had a guide before. It seriously",
          "We loved the exhibit. Quite a lot to see and most informative. The gift shop has lots of interesting items.",
          "The Winnipeg Art Gallery has set up the Picasso exhibit in a wonderfully awe inspiring presentation. Today I gained a new perspective with regards to this artist's work. Picasso's pieces are not all abstract, and along with the written stories posted beside most of his art,",
          "I was wowed. It was excellent and I managed to catch a tour. I hate those recorded things that you press and # and listen. I get bored real quickly. Tours are not available at all times. I have gone back a couple of times and was very disappointed.",
          "From the city - played tourist for a weekend. (now in fairness we had just come back from Paris earlier this year - so comparison to Orly / Louvre / Picasso is VERY UNFAIR). Limited art getting ready for large exhibit. A little bit of art, in a very scattered pattern. I will",
          "My wife and i decided to go to the Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) on friday March 31st. We had not been there in a long time. There was no special art showing. I know it is spring in Winnipeg but the walk up to the building was dirty and not visually appealing. We fortunately had",
          "Went there for a school trip to the exhibit about Ancient Greece. Great art, the guides were well informed. The parts of the exhibits that were made out of Lego were probably my favourite.",
          "I have enjoyed the various exhibitions and displays over the years. The staff have been wonderful, and the gift shop has wonderful gift ideas. A Winnipeg treasure indeed !",
          "The Winnipeg Art Gallery has done a wonderful job curating pieces for the various exhibits, but by far the stand out for us was the Inuit Art Collection. It is SO exciting to see the plans for the brand new Inuit Art Centre that will begin construction soon. The WAG has over",

          "Finally made it to the Winnipeg Art Gallery for an afternoon. We particularly enjoyed the Inuit art exhibits and very much look forward to the new Inuit Art Centre. A diverse range of exhibits meant it was very easy to spend over two hours at the gallery. Love the gift shop-",
          "Excellent selection of unique pieces in the gift shop. Shop from local artists and others across Canada.",
          "We were given free passes to the WAG and had not been here for over a year. We have visited many of the major art galleries throughout the world and on past visits I have found that although trying hard the WAG just could not compete. Of course not like the Louvre or Met,",
          "They amp you up on the main floor to look forward to whats upstairs like the surf and skate exhibit.... LAME. Please don't make me go back.",
          "Why is it that you never do the tourist things in your home town until you have visitors come to visit. I took my niece and nephew to the art gallery this week. I was very impressed with the new exhibits. Our Land showed different techniques and artists from the north. Some",
          "Loving art I was looking forward to seeing what was in store. I was not disappointed. The first floor has some ancient tapestries that are gorgeous. Moving up to the third floor, its sectioned into various time periods. The gallery that impressed me the most was the one that",
          "Need to add something interesting, maybe more European and Asian art. The Inuit art is interesting but takes up an entire floor and isn't very popular, need to consider expanding the place. After 30 mins, you will have seen most of the good stuff.",
          "Saw a remarkable Inuit Art Exhibit including painting, textiles, beadwork, clothing, sculpture in wood and stone and traditional prints. The interpreters on-site in the evening seemed to have knowledge of specific facts about individual pieces, but not much in-depth knowledge",

          "The Winnipeg Art Gallery or \"WAG\", located at 300 Memorial Boulevard in Winnipeg is a treasure. The first thing most visitors will notice is the striking architecture made up of angular shapes. Built in 1971, the WAG is regarded as one of the finest late-modernist 20th Century",
          "We went to the gallery late in the day and did not have sufficient time to do a full tour at a pace which art deserves. The gallery had a fairly large show of lesser Chagall paintings which I understand they own. They also had a great exhibit of Inuit carvings which had some",
          "We were very lucky to catch two special exhibits -- Inuit sculpture by a female artist and the Marc Chagall pictures of one of the Greek myths. We also appreciated the section of Canadian artists. You will need about two hours to cover this museum. It is well organized and",

          "Chagall exhibit very nicely done. The surprise was how much we liked the other special- Inuit art. The museum is small enough to see all of it in a couple hours. Features Canadian artists displayed in context with similarly styled (mostly European)artists.",
          "Even the building itself is a work of art. I'm not particularly an art enthusiast, though I do enjoy looking at it. This gallery was perfect for me. Not too big or overwhelming. Simple layout. I especially loved the Karl Funk exhibit. Make sure to make a pit stop on the rooftop",
          "This gallery is perfect in size and openness. It has a great collection of its own and rotates these displays in a timely manner while also displaying works of travelling contemporary and classic art.",
          "This is one of the better Canadian galleries. Not only is it interesting in its architecture (built in 1971, and is regarded as one of the finest late-modernist buildings in the country), the curator always presents unique shows. I have been there many times, and am never",
          "Had to hunt for parking but it turned out that we parked in a nearby street close to the museum. There were two wonderful exhibits that were Impressive one Chagall and two a Canadian artist who was obtaining his MFA in New York, his theme were people on the subway very unique",

          "I recently visited the WAG during while I was in town for a convention because an exhibit of my favourite artist, Marc Chagall, was opening. The exhibit is absolutely beautiful! Their permanent exhibits are very good, the museum itself is gorgeous and all of the staff members",
          "This is a good local museum, but they have a world class Inuit collection. And the new addition they have planned to exhibit its Inuit collection is stunning. It has vision and clearly articulated purpose, and it is beautiful.",
          "I has here for a private group viewing in the winter of 2016. The museum is in a large beautiful building located in downtown Winnipeg. I was not fond of the modern art pieces. The museum did have a nice First Nations selection. The staff was helpful, knowledgable, and friendly.",
          "We visited the Sculptures on loan from Berlin, and were floored by the quality of the exhibit and the wonderful staff and volunteers of WAG. Lots of perches throughout for us to rest on while viewing these magnificent pieces. We then checked out the Group of Seven exhibit",
          "We visited to see the statues on loan from Berlin last summer and although the statuary was amazing, it's just always less than I expect. There is this large and striking building, but there really isn't that much there. For the size of the city, that seems to be true of many",
          "We mad two attempts to see this exhibit.The first was not good. There were noisy school tours.You could not here the audio guide.. There was also a security guard whistling when we were trying to watch the film at the start. We left got our money back. We went again to-day",

          "Lovely gallery with both static and temporary exhibits, plus a great gift shop with a terrific selection of art, pottery, books, cards, and jewellery by local artisans. You can visit the gift shop for free, but must pay to see the galleries.",
          "The art gallery is ever changing and they do a great job bringing in new exhibits. My favourite event they host is the playing of the Cannes Commercial festival. You get to watch on average 100 commercials from around the world that were chosen of the best for that year. It",

          "The exhibit was well arranged with an audio recording for many of the collections. It took about an hour to visit the 8 theme galleries. As there was not a large crowd attending the event, you could take as much time as you wanted viewing the exhibits. We enjoyed a",
          "I found my first visit at the WAG to be a moving experience. It was quiet and I am not sure if we had seen others there or not. I want to see many of the pieces I saw again and now, I wonder why it took me so long to go there.",

      "name": "Royal Canadian Mint",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Royal Canadian Mint (French: Monnaie royale canadienne) is a Crown corporation, operating under the Royal Canadian Mint Act. The shares of the Mint are held in trust for the Crown in right of Canada.\nThe Mint produces all of Canada's circulation coins, and manufactures circulation coins on behalf of other nations. The Mint also designs and manufactures precious and base metal collector coins; gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion coins; medals, as well as medallions and tokens. It further offers gold and silver refinery and assay services.\nThe Mint serves the public's interest but is also mandated to operate \"in anticipation of profit\" (i.e., to function in a commercial manner without relying on taxpayer support to fund its operations). Like private-sector companies, the Mint has a board of directors consisting of a chair, the president and CEO of the Mint, and eight other directors.\nTraditionally, the President of the Royal Canadian Mint is known as the Master of the Mint. The president is Marie Lemay, who was appointed to the position in 2018. The Board of Directors, through the Chair, is accountable to the Minister of Finance. The Minister serves as the link between the Mint, Cabinet and Parliament.\nThe Mint was named one of \"Canada's Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. from 2007 to 2010.In March 2012 the Canadian Government decided to cease the production of pennies. The final penny was minted at the RCM's Winnipeg, Manitoba plant on the morning of May 4, 2012.In April 2012, the Mint announced it was developing MintChip, a digital currency to allow anonymous transactions backed by the Government of Canada and denominated in a variety of currencies.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ottawa facility ===\n\nFor the first fifty years of Canadian coinage (cents meant to circulate in the Province of Canada were first struck in 1858), the coins were struck at the Royal Mint in London, though some were struck at the private Heaton Mint in Birmingham, England. As Canada emerged as a nation in its own right, its need for coinage increased. As a result, a branch of the Royal Mint was authorized to be built in Ottawa in 1901 after being first proposed in 1890.During a short ceremony, Lord Grey and his wife, Lady Grey, activated the presses for the Canadian Mint on January 2, 1908, officially opening the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint. When the facility first opened, it had 61 employees. Three years later the Mint began refining gold by electrolysis in its assay department. This method proved to be too time-consuming and in 1915 the Mint introduced a new chlorination process developed in Australia to reduce processing times and increase the Mint's gold refining capacity. Since then, the Mint's refinery has undergone several changes and expansions. Today's process is a combination of chlorination and electrolysis.\nOver the years the Mint had used different processes to recover and sell the silver often found in unrefined gold, but, in 2006, the Mint opened a new, state-of-the-art silver refinery that finally allowed it to refine silver. The silver is first upgraded in an oxygen converter and then refined by electrolysis.\nIt wasn't until the Great Depression that the Ottawa Mint negotiated its independence from the British Royal Mint. In 1931, the Ottawa Mint was renamed the Royal Canadian Mint and began reporting solely to the Department of Finance. Although the Mint continued to rely on the Royal Mint to produce the master tools required for the creation of its punches and dies, the Mint was finally under Canadian control. In 1969, the Government of Canada reorganized the Mint as a Crown corporation. As such, the Mint was no longer a branch of the Department of Finance. It would operate like a corporation with its own Board of Directors and increased decision-making powers.\nIn 1979, the Royal Canadian Mint building in Ottawa was designated a National Historic Site, on the grounds the building is representative of the federal government's approach to using the Tudor Gothic architectural style to create a distinctive identity in Canada's capital, and of the patriation of control over Canada's currency from Britain.The Mint's facility in Ottawa is responsible for producing collector and commemorative coins, bullion in the form of coins, bars, wafers and grain, medals and medallions. This is also where the master tooling is done to create the dies that strike coin designs for both circulation and commemorative issues. The Mint's gold and silver refineries and assay labs are also in Ottawa, as is a full-time Advanced Engineering Research team dedicated to R+D projects.\nThe last surviving member of the Mint's original staff was Owen Toller. He started in the Mint as a Junior Clerk and retired as an Administrative Officer. He retired after 45 years of service on January 6, 1953. Mr. Toller died in November 1987 at the age of 102.\n\n\n=== Winnipeg facility ===\n\nIn November 1960 the Master of the Mint, N.A. Parker, advised the Minister of Finance that there was a need for a new facility. The Ottawa facility had reached capacity, the Philadelphia Mint was producing a large number of Canadian 10\u00a2 coins and all numismatic coins were being produced in Hull, Quebec. It was finally recognized the Mint required an additional facility.\nIn 1963 and 1964, the government discussed the possibility of building a facility that would be functional within two years. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson suggested building the facility in Elliot Lake, Ontario. A 1968 study showed the Ottawa Mint facility was antiquated. When the Royal Canadian Mint became a Crown corporation in 1969, many believed a decision would be reached.[7] Although funds had been allocated for a new facility, no real planning had begun. Emphasis was made on finding space in Ottawa. It was decided the Royal Canadian Mint would keep the historic building and have a new facility for manufacturing circulation coins.The federal government of the time, led by Pierre Trudeau, decided to decentralize many public services. The result was a claim for restitution from the province of Manitoba, complaining about its loss of many military bases. In February 1970, Supply and Services Minister James Richardson, the Minister responsible for the Mint, proposed the possibility of a new facility in Winnipeg. This proposal was cause for debate because it was legally stipulated the Mint was unlike any other government operation and money should be produced in Canada's capital region. Another point of tension was that the Cabinet Minister was from Winnipeg. Plants that are over 1,000 miles apart would endure communication and distribution difficulties. A study had shown the division had merit because raw materials could be purchased from a supplier in Alberta, rather than a competitor outside of Canada. Eventually, it was agreed upon in December 1971 the Mint would build a facility in Winnipeg. The land was purchased in 1972 and construction began at the end of the year.\nThe new facility was completely different in appearance from the facility in Ottawa. Architect \u00c9tienne Gaboury designed a striking triangular building that rises up dramatically from the surrounding prairie. Gaboury was Design Architect, in collaboration with the Number Ten Architectural Group led by partner-in-charge Allan Hanna. The Mint facility in Winnipeg was officially opened in 1976. The Winnipeg branch of the Royal Canadian Mint allowed the Ottawa facility to concentrate solely on collector coins while Winnipeg would produce the entire supply of circulation and foreign coins.\nThe Winnipeg facility is responsible for producing the circulation currency of other nations. Since opening its doors in 1976, the Mint's Winnipeg facility has produced coinage for over 70 countries: centavos for Cuba, kroner for Norway, fils for Yemen, pesos for Colombia, kroner for Iceland, baht for Thailand, and a thousand-dollar coin for Hong Kong. Other client nations include Barbados, New Zealand and Uganda.\n\n\n== Organizational structure ==\n\n\n=== Executive and Board of Directors ===\nThe Royal Canadian Mint is a Crown corporation and operates under the Royal Canadian Mint Act. In serving the public's interest, a Crown corporation has greater managerial independence than other government entities, meaning it may operate in a commercial manner. Like private sector companies, the Mint has a Board of Directors composed of a chairman, the President and CEO of the Mint and eight other directors.\nTraditionally, the President and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint is known as the Master of the Mint. The president is Marie Lemay (appointed in 2019), and the Chairman of the Board is Phyllis Clark. In descending chronological order, the individuals who have served as the Mint's Master Engraver are: Cosme Saffioti, Sheldon Beveridge, Ago Aarand, Walter Ott, Patrick Brindley, Myron Cook, and Thomas Shingles.\nThe government department responsible for the Royal Canadian Mint is the Department of Finance. There are 10 members of the Mint's Board of Directors, and 12 members on its Executive Team. The Royal Canadian Mint has four lines of business: Bullion and Refinery Service, Canadian Circulation, Foreign Business, and Numismatics.A listing of all the Masters of the Mint is as follows:\nA listing of the Mint's Board of Directors:\n\n\n=== Bullion products and refinery ===\nThe Mint produces and markets a family of high-purity gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Maple Leaf bullion coins, wafers, and bars for the investment market as well as gold and silver granules for the jewellery industry and industrial applications. The Mint also provides Canadian and foreign customers with gold and silver processing, including refining, assaying, and secure storage.Additionally, the Royal Canadian Mint operates a technically advanced refinery in which it refines precious metals from a variety of sources, including primary producers, industry, recyclers, and financial institutions. The mint refines raw gold to 995 fine through the Miller chlorination process. The gold is then cast into anodes for electrolytic purification to 9999 fine using the Wohlwill process.\nIn May 2007, the mint produced the world's first and only 99.999% pure gold Maple Leaf Bullion (GML) coins. Offered in limited-edition 1-troy-ounce (31 g) gold bullion coins, three series of these special GML coins were produced (2007, 2008, 2009) in addition to the 99.99% pure GML coin, which is produced on demand. A 100 kg version of the 99.999% pure GML coin was produced as a promotional tool and was later sold as a product when interested buyers came forward.\n\n\n=== Canadian circulation ===\nThe Mint's core mandate is to produce and manage the distribution of Canada's circulation coinage and provide advice to the Minister of Finance on all matters related to coinage.\nRecently, up to two billion Canadian circulation coins are struck each year at the Mint's facility in Winnipeg. While the effigy of the reigning monarch has appeared on every Canadian coin produced by the Mint since 1908, reverse designs have changed considerably over the years. The Mint often introduces new commemorative designs which celebrate Canada's history, culture and values.\nSince 2000, all of Canada's circulation coins have been produced using the Mint's patented multi-ply plated steel technology except for the $1 and $2 circulation coins, which started using this technology as of April 10, 2012.\n\n\n=== Foreign circulation coins ===\nMany foreign countries have had coinage struck at the Royal Canadian Mint, including circulation coins, numismatic coins, and ready-to-strike blanks. In 1970, Master of the Mint, Gordon Ward Hunter, relaunched the Foreign Circulation division. A contract for Singapore was won in January 1970, to produce six million rimmed blanks in a copper-nickel alloy.  This was their first export contract since a contract for the Dominican Republic 32 years earlier. The second contract came in April 1970 with the Central Bank of Brazil. The RCM produced 84 million blanks for the 50-centavo piece. In August 1971, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen placed an order for 2 million five-fil pieces. This was followed by an order from Iceland for 2.5 million one-crown pieces.\nIn October 1971, the Bank of Jamaica asked the RCM to produce a commemorative ten-dollar coin in sterling silver, and a twenty-dollar gold coin of proof quality. Also in 1971, the RCM made coins for the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Iran, and the Isle of Man. An order for 100 million general circulation five-centime and ten-centimo coins for Venezuela was received as well. By 1973, orders totalled 65 million coins, and seventy million blanks. By 1974, the Ottawa facility produced a total of 1.2 billion coins (foreign and domestic), a facility record.Part of the Winnipeg Mint's legacy is its role in producing the circulation currency of other nations. 50 million units of the 20\u00a2 Australian coin featuring a platypus were minted in 1981. These have included centavos for Cuba, kroner for Norway, fils for Yemen, pesos for Colombia, kroner for Iceland, rupiah for Indonesia, baht for Thailand, and a thousand-dollar coin for Hong Kong. Other client nations include Barbados and Uganda.\nMore recently, the Mint has produced coins for a variety of other countries such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.In 2005, the Mint was awarded a contract valued at US$1.2 million to produce 50 million toea coins for Papua New Guinea. The circulation coins were produced in denominations of 5 toea, 10 toea and 20 toea, and were manufactured at the Mint's facility in Winnipeg.In 2008, the Mint produced over three million coloured 50-toea coins for Papua New Guinea. These were the world's first coloured coins to circulate outside of Canada. In addition to adding a painted design to more than three million coins, the Mint was required to identically orient the design on every coin. To accomplish this, the Mint, in collaboration with Canadian robotic equipment manufacturer PharmaCos Machinery, developed its own robotic arm to \u201cpick and place\u201d each coin on the painting line, creating a new technical capability unique to the Royal Canadian Mint.The Mint has also supplied 230 million low-denomination coins to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 2006. The Reserve Bank chose to reduce the size of its existing 50-, 20- and 10-cent coins and manufacture them using the Mint's multi-ply plating technology.\nThe customers have included governments, central banks, and treasuries. In 2005 alone, the RCM manufactured 1.062 billion coins and blanks for 14 countries. From 1980 to 2005, the RCM has manufactured approximately 52 billion coins for 62 countries. These coins are manufactured at the Royal Canadian Mint's facility in Winnipeg.\nThe Mint produces circulation and numismatic coins, ready-to-strike blanks, medals, medallions and tokens for customers around the world. They also offer dies, die coatings, master punches and tooling, plus roll and wrap and other coin packaging. The Mint has the capacity to produce over 2 billion circulation coins or blanks per year for foreign governments.\n\n\n=== Numismatic coins ===\nThe mint makes collector coins and related products for collectors and enthusiasts in Canada and all over the world. Several of these coins have earned international industry awards and in 2010, the mint sold out the entire mintage of a record 25 collector coins.Made of base and precious metals, several of the mint's numismatic coins are enhanced by special technologies including holograms, enamelling, lasering and embedded crystals. The mint also produces medals, medallions and tokens as part of this business line.\nThe mint produces a great number of military decorations for the Department of National Defence including: the Sacrifice Medal, the Canadian Forces Decoration and Clasp, the General Campaign Star, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Bars, the General Service Medal, the Special Service Medal, the Operational Service Medal, the Memorial Cross and the Canadian Victoria Cross. It also produces military decorations for Veterans Affairs Canada, as well as long-service medals for the RCMP and artistic achievement awards for the Governor General of Canada.The mint also produced the athletes' medals of the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games and the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The mint produced 615 Olympic and 399 Paralympic medals at their headquarters in Ottawa for the 2010 Winter Games.The mint also designed and produced the 4,283 medals for the Toronto 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am games.\n\n\n== Notable coins ==\n\n\n=== Bullion coins ===\nIn 1979, the mint began producing its own branded bullion coins, which feature a maple leaf on the reverse. Since 1979, the fineness of the gold used to strike the Gold Maple Leaf (GML) coins has increased from .999 to .9999, and finally, to .99999 (for a special series from 2007 to 2009). In addition, GMLs are produced in sizes that are fractions of a troy ounce: 1 oz, \u200b1\u20442 oz, \u200b1\u20444 oz, \u200b1\u204410 oz, \u200b1\u204415 oz, \u200b1\u204420 oz, \u200b1\u204425 oz, and in sets that combine some or all of these weights. Special-edition designs have commemorated the tenth anniversary of the GML (1989), the 125th anniversary of the RCMP (1997), and the 25th anniversary of the GML (1994). A three-coin set was released to commemorate the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games (2008\u20132010), and a fractional GML set was issued in 2011 to commemorate the centennial of the mint's gold refinery. Renowned for its unrivalled purity, the mint's Gold Maple Leaf remains one of the world's most popular bullion coins.\n\n\n==== Silver Maple Leaf ====\nThe Royal Canadian Mint's Silver Maple Leaf (SML) was first issued in 1988 and featured the same design as the Gold Maple Leaf bullion coin. These coins are available to investors in 1 oz, \u200b1\u20442 oz, \u200b1\u20444 oz, \u200b1\u204410 oz, and \u200b1\u204420 oz sizes.In 2004\u201305, the coins were sold in sets of four coins that featured two wildlife species: the Arctic fox (2004) and the Canada lynx (2005). Each coin was of a different value and depicted the animals in a separate pose. Colour and selective gold plating have also been applied to special issues of SML. Holograms have proved popular applications, having been featured on SML coins in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005.In 2010, the mint introduced a new series of silver 9999 fine 1-troy-ounce (31 g) bullion coins featuring Canadian wildlife. The first coin, launched in late 2010, depicts a wolf, while the second features a grizzly bear. The third design, depicting a cougar, was released on September 24, 2011, for public sales. The fourth in the series was a moose, the fifth coin was the pronghorn antelope, and the sixth and final coin was the wood bison.\n\n\n==== Platinum and Palladium Maple Leafs ====\nWhile the Silver and Gold Maple Leafs have proved endearingly popular among investors and bullion collectors, the mint has also produced limited numbers of Platinum and Palladium Maple Leaf coins. From 2005 to 2009, Palladium Maple Leaf coins were offered in 1-troy-ounce (31 g) coins of .9995 fineness.Platinum Maple Leafs were struck in 1 oz, \u200b1\u20442 oz, \u200b1\u20444 oz, \u200b1\u204410 oz, \u200b1\u204415 oz, and \u200b1\u204420 oz weights, between 1988 and 1999 and again in 2009. In addition, the Platinum Maple Leafs were sold in special issue sets in 1989 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the GML and in 2002 as a five-coin set featuring holograms. In 1999, the coins featured the polar bear design appearing on the inner ring of the $2 circulation coin.\n\n\n=== Canadian circulation coins ===\n\n\n==== V nickel ====\nWorld War II saw low mintages of most coins, as the metals (especially copper and nickel) were needed for the war effort. The composition of the 5\u00a2 coin was changed to tombac in 1942; and the design was changed to a V for Victory in 1943. The composition was changed again to nickel-chromium-plated steel in 1944.\nThe concept for the V design came from Winston Churchill's famous V sign, and the V denomination mark on the US 5\u00a2 pieces of 1883\u20131912. A novel feature was an inscription of Morse code on the coin. This International Code message meant \"We Win When We Work Willingly\" and was placed along the rim on the reverse instead of denticles. The regular reverse and composition were resumed in 1946. Chromium-plated steel was again used for the 5\u00a2 coin from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War, but the reverse was unchanged.\n\n\n==== Centennial of Confederation ====\nIn 1967, the mint introduced a series of commemorative coins in honour of the Canadian centennial. Designed by Alex Colville, every coin produced that year featured a creature native to Canada: a rock dove on the 1\u00a2 coin, a rabbit on the 5\u00a2 coin, a mackerel on the 10\u00a2 coin, a lynx on the 25\u00a2 coin, a howling wolf on the 50\u00a2 coin, and a Canada goose on the dollar. A commemorative gold $20 coin was also struck for collectors' sets, with a coat of arms on the reverse. It is worth noting the Royal Canadian Mint wanted to commemorate Canada's 60th anniversary in 1927 with variant coin designs.\n\n\n==== Royal Canadian Mounted Police ====\n\nFor 1973, the usual 25\u00a2 coin reverse depicting a caribou was replaced with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer astride a horse, to celebrate the centennial of the founding of the North-West Mounted Police (now the RCMP).\nIn 2007, the mint also released a $75 coloured gold coin featuring RCMP officers astride their horses, as part of an extensive program of collector coins celebrating the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. This coin, designed by Cecily Mok, is composed of 58.33% gold and 41.67% silver.\nThe mint also issued two bullion coins in celebration of the RCMP. The first is a 1997 1-troy-ounce (31 g) gold coin, which was produced for the 125th anniversary of the RCMP. The second is a 2010 1\u204425-troy-ounce (1.2 g) gold coin and was designed by Janet Griffin-Scott.\n\n\n==== \"Loonie\" and \"toonie\" ====\nThe major change to Canadian coinage in the 1980s was the introduction of a circulating $1 coin, widely known as the loonie because of the common loon gracing its reverse. A voyageur canoe had been planned initially, but the master reverse die was lost in shipment between Ottawa and Winnipeg, so a new design was necessary. Introduced in 1987, the coin began to replace the $1 banknote in February 1989. In 1996, the mint introduced a $2 circulating coin (known widely as the toonie) that featured a polar bear on the reverse and replaced the $2 banknote. The $2 coin was also a first for the mint in that it used a bi-metallic structure \u2013 the coin's centre is bronze-coloured and the circumference is nickel-coloured.\n\n\n==== Saskatchewan Roughriders ====\nIn September 2010, the mint released 3 million $1 circulation coins in celebration of the Saskatchewan Roughriders' centennial. This coin's reverse is engraved with the Saskatchewan Roughriders' logo and a stylized \"100\" framed by the dates 1910 and 2010.\n\n\n==== UFO-themed glow-in-the-dark coin ====\nThe Shag Harbour UFO incident on October 4, 1967, was commemorated in a glow-in-the dark coin launched October 1, 2019.This coin is the second in the Royal Canadian Mint's \"unexplained phenomena\" series. The first coin in the series was released in 2018 and depicts the UFO encounter near Falcon Lake (Manitoba) in 1967.The coin is not the first glow-in-the-dark coin released by the Royal Canadian Mint. The first coin depicts boaters gazing at the Northern Lights, and was released in 2017.\n\n\n=== Foreign coins ===\n\nIn October 1971, the Bank of Jamaica asked the RCM to produce a commemorative $10 coin in silver and a $20 gold coin of proof quality. Also in 1971, the RCM made coins for the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Iran, and the Isle of Man. An order for 100 million general-circulation five-centime and ten-centimo coins for Venezuela was received as well. By 1973, orders totalled 65 million coins, and 70 million blanks. By 1974, the Ottawa facility produced a facility record 1.2 billion coins (foreign and domestic).Two years later, the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority of Macau commissioned the Royal Canadian Mint to create a commemorative coin to recognize the transfer of the Macau region to the People's Republic of China. The coin is silver and features a gold cameo. The face value is 100 patacas, and the coin has a diameter of 37.97 mm and a guaranteed weight of at least 1 troy ounce (31 g), while most 1 oz silver RCM coins weigh 31.3 grams. The Royal Canadian Mint item number is 644309 and the issue price is $102. The coin features a Portuguese ship and a Chinese barque sharing coastal waters. The historic Ma Gao Temple (Pagoda de Barra) appears in the cameo.\nIn 2009, the Mint produced coins and blanks for 18 countries, including the decimo de balboa (10-cent coin) for Panama.\n\n\n=== Numismatic coins ===\nIn 2006, the Royal Canadian Mint issued the $50 Four Seasons 5-troy-ounce (160 g) 0.9999 silver coin. This was the first 5 oz pure silver coin issued by the mint, and had a limited mintage of only 2,000 coins worldwide. High-grade examples of this coin fetch $1500 to $5000 at auction. Demand for the coin has been unprecedented, and it was the lowest mintage 0.9999 silver coin ever produced by the Royal Canadian Mint until the 2009 release of \"Surviving the Flood\", a 1 kilo 0.9999 silver coin which has a worldwide mintage of only 1500.On October 19, 2007, the Royal Canadian Mint issued ten new collector coins, including a 25\u00a2 coin minted to commemorate the 60th wedding anniversary of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; and a $15 sterling silver coin bearing the effigy of Victoria, the first from the series of five coins illustrating the effigies of the previous Canadian monarchs.\n\n\n==== Toronto Transit Commission tokens ====\nFrom 1954 to 2006, the mint supplied the Toronto Transit Commission with 24 million tokens. These tokens were taken out of service in 2007 for official use. The lightweight token was replaced due to the ease in duplicating counterfeit versions. Current TTC tokens are manufactured in the United States by Osborne Coinage.\n\n\n==== Canadian Tire ====\nIn October 2009, the mint produced trade dollars for Canadian Tire which temporarily replaced their regular $1 coupons. The initiative called for the production of 2.5 million nickel-plated steel tokens, as well as 9,000 brass-plated steel tokens. As part of the limited-time offer, the trade dollars were distributed in 475 stores nationwide.\n\n\n==== Notable medallions ====\nIn 1983, the RCM issued a medallion to commemorate the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The composition of the medal is 50% pure silver and has a diameter of 36 mm. The coin had a production limit of 100,000 and its issue price was $24.50.\nThe RCM created a medallion to honour Elvis Presley. The medal features the word Graceland (above an image of the mansion and its gates) and an actual denomination of $10. The reverse of the medal features an engraving of Elvis, along with the words \"The Man/The Music/The Legend\". The medallion itself is undated, but as the medal is 10 troy ounces (310 g), one would assume it was made for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. Additional information can be found in the certificate of authenticity which states this Elvis Presley medal was authorized by Legendary Coins and struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. The packaging bears a copyright date of 1987, and states the \"medal is for commemorative purposes only\" and is \"not legal tender\".\nMedallions honouring hockey legends have also been created. To commemorate Mario Lemieux's induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame, a special set honouring all the inductees was issued in 1997. In 1999, a nickel medallion was issued to honour Wayne Gretzky's retirement. The issue price was $9.99 with a mintage of 50,000.\n\n\n== Notable innovations ==\n\n\n=== Multi-ply plating ===\nIn 2000, the Mint patented an improved, money-saving production method called multi-ply plating technology. Since that year, the Mint has used this technique to produce 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2, and 50\u00a2 pieces of Canadian circulation coinage, all of which were previously minted from nearly pure nickel alloys. Similarly, a copper-plated steel blank was used to produce the 1\u00a2 coin until production ceased in 2012. Also in 2012, multi-ply plating was introduced for the $1 and $2 coins.\nThis particular plating process uses a steel core that is electro-magnetically plated with a thin layer of nickel, then a layer of copper and finally another layer of nickel. As a smaller quantity of copper and nickel is required, this process has reduced circulation coin production costs. The composition of plated coins is more durable, thereby reducing the number of damaged coins in circulation and increasing their overall efficiency. By varying the thicknesses of the alternating layers of nickel and copper, the Mint can create coins with unique electromagnetic signatures, preventing fraud and producing the most secure circulation coins on the market.\n\n\n=== Coloured coins ===\nIn 2004, the Royal Canadian Mint issued the world's first coloured circulation coin. The 25\u00a2 coins were produced at the Mint's facility in Winnipeg and feature a red-coloured poppy embedded in the centre of a maple leaf over a banner that reads: \"Remember / Souvenir\". The obverse features the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Susanna Blunt. The process of adhering colour to the coins surfaces involved the utilization of a high-speed, computer-controlled and precision inkjet process. Approximately 30,000,000 coins went into circulation in October 2004 and were available exclusively at Tim Hortons locations across the country. U.S. Army contractors travelling in Canada filed confidential espionage reports describing the coins as \"anomalous\" and \"filled with something man-made that looked like nano-technology\".In 2006, the Mint produced a second colourized circulation coin in support of a future without breast cancer. The 25\u00a2 coin features the pink ribbon symbolizing breast cancer awareness.\nMore recently, the Mint produced two other 25\u00a2 poppy circulation coins in 2008 and 2010, both of which feature colourized designs.\nIn 2008, the Mint also produced 50-toea colourized coins for Papua New Guinea. These coins were manufactured using a robotic mechanism that oriented the coins in a way that ensured all the colourized designs faced the same direction.This new technology was also used to produce the \"Top Three Moments\" coins. These 25\u00a2 coins are part of the Mint\u2019s Vancouver 2010 circulation coin program and feature designs celebrating the top three favourite moments in Canadian Winter Games history. The men's hockey gold medal at Salt Lake City in 2002 was voted by fans as the No. 1 Canadian Olympic Winter Games Moment of all time \u2013 out of 10 moments \u2014 in an online contest hosted in 2009 by the Mint and Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium. Coming in at No. 2 was the Canadian women's hockey gold medal at Salt Lake City 2002, followed by Cindy Klassen at No. 3 and her five long-track speed skating medals at Turin 2006. The coins marking these top three favourite moments were launched into circulation on September 29, 2009, November 17, 2009 and January 5, 2010 respectively.\n\n\n=== Physical vapour deposition ===\nThe Mint succeeded in extending the life of the die beyond that of past chrome-coated dies, with the adaptation of the physical vapour deposition (PVD) technology to coat its dies.\n\n\n=== Glow-in-the-dark coins ===\nIn 2017, the Mint released a set of circulation coins for the 150th anniversary of Confederation. In these circulation coins, the $2 coin has a coloured version which features some northern lights. When left under a normal source of light and then turning off the lights or when illuminated by a UV lamp, the northern lights will glow turquoise. This coin was the first circulation coin in the world to glow in the dark, and as of 2020 the mint has not released another. Around ten million coins were minted, but it is expected that around only one in ten Canadians will have one. However, this was not the first time that the mint worked with glow-in-the-dark technology. In 2012, a three-coin set of glow-in-the-dark dinosaur skeletons were released, but these coins were never for circulation; they were made for collection.\n\n\n=== MINTSHIELD ===\nIn 2018, the Mint introduced MINTSHIELD, a production technology for its silver Maple Leaf coins aimed at reducing \"milk spots\". It is the only mint to offer technology specifically aimed at milk spots.\n\n\n== Vancouver Olympics ==\n\nIn 2006, the Mint entered a partnership with the Vancouver Olympic Committee and became an Official Supporter of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. As such, the Mint embarked upon an extensive three-year program of circulation and collector coins in honour of both the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.\nTheir Vancouver 2010 coin program included the largest circulation coin series in relation to the Olympic and Paralympic Games ever conceived by any mint worldwide. It included the production of 17 circulation coins, 15 of which were of the 25\u00a2 denomination and two of which were $1 \u2018Lucky Loonies.\u2019 The Mint was the first Mint in the world to commemorate the Paralympic Games on a circulation coin. These commemorative 25\u00a2 coins were distributed across the country through participating Petro-Canada and Royal Bank of Canada locations.\nRegarding the circulation coins, one of the novelties is that D.G. Regina (dei gratia regina, or \"by the grace of God queen\") will be removed from the Queen's effigy, making the 25\u00a2 coins the first \"godless circulating coins\" since the 2001 International Year of the Volunteer 10\u00a2 piece. On the 1911 issue of King George V, the inscription was accidentally left off. The first circulating $1 coin will be dated 2008 but the obverse will be the standard effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Susanna Blunt with the wording \"ELIZABETH II\" and \"D.G. REGINA\" with the Circle M privy mark.In addition to its circulation coin program, the Mint introduced a series of 36 collector coins ranging from multi-coloured sterling silver Lucky Loonies to premium gold coins. Most notably, two $2500 Kilo Gold Coins were produced as part of this program, marking the first time the Mint has issued a pure gold coin with a guaranteed weight of one kilogram.The program also included the production of two Sterling silver Lucky Loonies in 2008 and 2010, with mintages of 30,000 and 40,000 respectively.\n\n\n=== Vancouver 2010 Winter Games medals ===\nThe Mint also produced the athlete medals for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. The Vancouver 2010 gold medals are each made of sterling silver plated with six grams of 24KT gold. The silver medals are sterling silver while the bronze medals are composed mostly of copper. Their composition is governed by International Olympic Committee regulations.Each medal features a piece of one of two contemporary Aboriginal artworks and weighing 500 to 576 grams each. The design appearing on each of the Vancouver 2010 medals is based on two large master artworks of an orca whale (Olympic) and raven (Paralympic) by Corrine Hunt, a Canadian artist of Komoyue and Tlingit heritage based in Vancouver, BC. Each medal features a unique, hand-cropped section of her artwork. The Vancouver 2010 medals are also undulating rather than flat. They had to be struck nine times each in order to achieve this unusual shape.The medals were on display throughout the 2010 Winter Games at the Royal Canadian Mint Pavilion in Vancouver. There, visitors waited in line to see and hold the medals, sometimes for over seven hours. During the Olympics, the Mint Pavilion at the Segal Centre entertained 140,639 visitors, while the medal display at the Vancouver Public Library during the Paralympics saw 30,000 visitors.\nWith so much interest generated by their Vancouver 2010 program, the Mint opened an additional retail outlet in Vancouver. This store is at 752 Granville Street, between Georgia and Robson streets.\n\n\n== Award-winning coins ==\n1985 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Coin: 1988 Olympic $20 coin, Downhill Skier (Note: Olympic coins in Canada are usually produced three years prior to the event)\n1986 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Gold Coin, Theme: 450th Anniversary, Jacques Cartier Voyage of Discovery\n1988 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Silver Coin, Theme: 400th Anniversary, Davis Passage\n1989 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Silver Coin, Theme: Bicentennial Voyage of Mackenzie River\n1993 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Gold Coin, Theme: Antique Autos\n1994 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by Munchen Magazin, Best Coin, Theme: Anne of Green Gables\n1996 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by Munchen Magazin, Best Coin, Theme: 100th Anniversary of Gold found in Klondike\n1997 \u2013 Coin of the Singapore International Coin Show, Best Coin, Theme: Haida Contemporative Art\n1998 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Gold Coin, Theme: Alexander Graham Bell\n1998 \u2013 Most Popular Coin, Presented by World Coin News, Most Popular, Theme: $2 coin with polar bear design\n1999 \u2013 International Hologram Manufacturers Association and Holography, Category: Excellence in Holographic Production, Theme: 20th Anniversary Gold Bullion Maple Leaf coin\n2000 \u2013 Most Popular Coin, Presented by World Coin News, Most Popular, Theme: 125th Anniversary of RCMP\n2000 \u2013 Most Technologically Advanced Coin, World Mint Directors Conference 2000, Theme: $20 coin featuring Hologram cameo on the Transportation Series\n2000 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Presented by World Coin News, Best Gold, Theme: Mother and Child\n2002 \u2013 Coin of the Year, Asia Money Fair, Theme: Asian Symbols Five Blessings Commemorative Set\n2006 \u2013 Most Innovative Coin of the Year, World Mint Directors Conference 2006, Theme: Coloured 25\u00a2 Poppy Coin\n2007 \u2013 Best New Coin Award, Awards for Excellence in Currency: Presented by the International Association of Currency Affairs\nCategory: Best Coin 25\u00a2 coloured circulation coin\nTheme: Creating a Future Without Breast Cancer\n2007 \u2013 2007 Coin of the Year Award and 2007 Most Innovative Coin Award, Presented at the 2008 World Money Fair, presented by Krause Publications\nCategory:Coin of the Year and Most Innovative Coin Coin: Big and Little Bear Constellations coins\nTheme: Constellation\n2007 \u2013 2007 Most Inspirational Coin Award, Presented at the 2008 World Money Fair, presented by Krause Publications\nCategory: Most Inspirational Coin\nCoin: Pink Ribbon coin Theme: Ribbon of Hope\n2010 \u2013 2010 Excellence in Currency Awards, Presented by IACA\nCategory: Best new series\nCoin: Vancouver 2010 Circulation Programme\n2010 \u2013 2010 Most Inspirational Coin Award, Presented at the 2010 World Money Fair, presented by Krause Publications\nCategory: Most Inspirational Coin\nCoin: Fine Gold Kilo \u2013 Towards Confederation\n2011 \u2013 2011 Best Silver Coin, Krause Publications 2011 Coin of the Year Awards\nCategory: Best Silver Coin\nCoin: 2009 Fine Silver Crystal Snowflake\n2011 \u2013 2011 Most Artistic, Krause Publications 2011 Coin of the Year Awards\nCategory: Most Artistic\nCoin: 2009 $300 Gold Coin \u2013 Summer Moon Mask\n\n\n== Coin markings, including mint marks and privy marks ==\nA \u2013 Used on 2005 palladium test coin to signify the coins were struck from Lot A.\nB \u2013 Used on 2005 palladium test coin to signify the coins were struck from Lot B.\nC \u2013 Placed on sovereigns produced at the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint, between 1908 and 1919.\nDot \u2013 In December 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in favour of his brother, who became King George VI. The problem was that the Royal Mint had been designing the effigy of King Edward VIII, and now a new effigy had to be created. The 1\u00a2, 10\u00a2 and 25\u00a2 pieces in 1937 were struck from dies with a 1936 date on the reverse. To distinguish that these coins were issued in 1937, a Dot Mint Mark was placed on the 1936 dies, beneath the year. These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready. While the 10\u00a2 and 25\u00a2 coins are more common, the 1\u00a2 coins are rare, with about a half-dozen known to exist. The dot after the date on the 1937 5\u00a2 coin is a mint error caused by a chip in the master dies.\nH \u2013 Used to identify coins that were struck for Canada by the Birmingham Mint, also known as the Heaton Mint, until 1907.\nInnukshuk \u2013 All circulation coins for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics have the Innukshuk Mint Mark on the obverse of the coin.\nInternational Polar Year \u2013 The obverse of the 2007 International Polar Year $20 numismatic coin has the logo for the International Polar Year on the obverse of the coin.\nMan Becomes Mountain (Symbol of Paralympics) \u2013 All circulation coins for the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics have the Paralympic Games logo on the obverse of the coin.\nMaple Leaf \u2013 All coins with a Maple Leaf Mint Mark were struck in 1948 due to an emergency with coin toolage. The granting of India's independence resulted in the removal of IND:IMP (meaning Emperor of India) from King George VI's effigy. Due to the demand for circulation coins in 1948, coins for 1948 could not be struck until the new tools were received. The new tools would have the IND:IMP removed from them. In the meanwhile, coins were produced in 1948 with a year of 1947 on them. Referred to as the 1947 Maple Leaf, a small Maple Leaf Mint Mark was struck beside 1947 on the reverse of all coins to signify the year of production.\nP \u2013 From 2001 to 2006, most 1\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2, and 50\u00a2 coins issued for circulation were struck with a P Mint Mark to represent the Royal Canadian Mint's plating process.\nRCM Logo \u2013 At the CNA Convention in July 2006, the RCM unveiled its new privy mark to be used on all circulation and numismatic coinage. The agenda behind the implementation of this new privy mark was to help increase the RCM's image as a brand. The aim of the logo is to educate coin users and coin collectors, respectively, that the RCM is minting Canada's coins. The first circulation coin to have this new mint mark is the 10th anniversary $2 coin. The first numismatic coin to have this new marking is the Snowbirds coin and stamp set.\nT/\u00c9 \u2013 In an effort to push the standard of quality higher, the RCM started to experiment with a gold bullion coin that would have a purity of 99.999%. The result was a Gold Maple Leaf test bullion coin with the mint mark of T/\u00c9 (to signify test/\u00e9preuve). The date on the obverse of the coin was 2007 and it had a mintage of 500.\nTeddy bear \u2013 When the RCM released its Baby Lullabies and CD Set, a sterling silver $1 coin was included in the set. The $1 coin included a privy mark of a teddy bear.\nW \u2013 Used occasionally on specimen sets produced in Winnipeg, starting in 1998.\nWP \u2013 Used on the special edition uncirculated set of 2003. The W mint mark indicates that the coin was produced in Winnipeg and the P indicates that the coins are plated.\n\n\n== Revenues ==\nRevenue by segment 2004\nRevenue by segment 2005\nRevenue by segment 2006\nRevenue by segment 2007\nRevenue by segment 2008\nRevenue by segment 2009\nRevenue by segment 2010\nRevenue by segment 2011\nRevenue by segment 2012\nRevenue by segment 2013\nRevenue by segment 2014\n\n\n== Security ==\nRoyal Canadian Mint Protective Services employs full-time and casual security officers who are responsible for the security and inspection of RCM facilities. They wear a distinctive black uniform with body armour and carry a 9\u202fmm Glock Model 17 while on duty. Their duties include:\nOperating X-Ray machines\nInspection of garbage in High Security Production Area\nCCTV monitoring\nAccess Control\nMonitor shipments received and dispatched from RCM facilities\nSecurity escorts\nParking management\nEvacuationsRecent issues concerning Royal Canadian Mint assets include:\n\nIn 2000, the Royal Canadian Mint lent a series of the new plated 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 issues to the vending industry for testing purposes. These coins were issued with the letter P below the Queen's effigy. Some of these coins were not returned to the RCM by the vendors and it is possible some were sold to collectors at a considerable premium.\nOn Tuesday, June 2, 2009, it was reported that the Auditor General of Canada found a discrepancy between the mint's 2008 financial accounting of its precious metals holdings and the physical stockpile at the plant on Sussex Drive in Ottawa. A review released on December 21, 2009, revealed that all of the misplaced gold was fully accounted for. A previously unaccounted 9,350 troy ounces (291 kg) was attributed to estimation errors, and a further 1,500 troy ounces (47 kg) was recovered through an extensive refining of slag within the Mint.\n\n\n== Notable firsts ==\n1st colour 1999 20th anniversary GML: 5-coin set\n1st hologram 1999: GML hologram set \u2013 5-coin set\n1st irregular shaped coin 2006: square sterling silver beaver\n1st 5 ounce 0.9999 silver coin 2006: Four Seasons $50 commemorative coin\n1st coloured coin using plasma technology: commemorative $20 plasma coin for the International Polar Year\n1st million-dollar face-value coin: 100 kg 99.999% pure gold\n1st glass added coin 2017: Under the Sea Series: Seahorse\n1st glow-in-the-dark coin 2017: Canada 150 Anniversary Set: Aurora Boris 2$ coin\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCanadian Bank Note Company \u2013 one of two companies responsible for the printing of Canadian banknotes\nGiesecke & Devrient \u2013 the German parent company of BA International, the other company responsible for printing Canadian banknotes\nList of mints\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRoyal Canadian Mint Act\nCanadian coins \u2013 value and description\nRoyal Canadian Numismatic Association\nNumismatic Network Canada\nCanadian Coin News",

          "The royal mint is a great attraction in Winnipeg and if visiting for a few days I woul highly recommend",
          "It was OK. I guess I had visions of actually seeing coins being made. But the machines are enclosed so you really can't see what is happening. The tour is done above the machines in a rather small glassed-in area. The area had pictures to see what is happening and short videos",
          "The tour takes between forty-five and sixty minutes. The guide we had was very knowledgable. \\\\\\\\made the tour fun.",
          "Wonderful tour for anyone, coin collector or not. Educational and interesting, all staff are very knowledgeable! On hand stock is amazing as well.",
          "Wasn\u2019t even aware this place was in Winnipeg Manitoba!! Our friends took us to see it!! So interesting, however, we went on a Sunday , it was open, but no tours that day!! But we were still able to look around and read and learn about The Mint!! Beautiful gift area and well",
          "They make coins here for 70+ countries. I never realized the process that goes into making coins. Interesting",
          "We were looking forward to our visit but it was our bad luck that the machines were not operating that week. While the tour guide was very knowledgeable and did her best to make it interesting, it was pretty dry. Still there were a number of visitors that day and we only got",
          "Well worth the short drive out to the Mint. You drive in through a flag lined road - each flag representing a country for which the Mint has produced coins. The tour was very informative - we were there on a weekend, so the Mint was not in operation. Nice gift shop though",
          "I had no idea we, as in Canada, made coins for so many countries around the world. Great tour and good tour guides. No photos allowed.",

          "The 45 min Tour is filled with interesting facts and figures. It is the perfect length of time and moves along quickly to keep everyone\u2019s interest no matter their age. Our group was quite large and a small microphone would have helped some people hear better but the guide did",

          "The original Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa makes some coins, but the one we visited in Winnipeg now glamorously turns out most of Canada's glittering money! That fact is evident in the approach to the building, where you drive along a curving avenue of flags of c.70-80",
          "You can tour the Royal Canadian mint, located on the outskirts of Winnepeg, with guides. We had a wonderful time seeing how the mint operated and then spent some of the mint's products in the shop located there. The mint, like many buildings in the city, is quite a beauty and",

          "Book this tour in advance. Used Tapp Car from my hotel room.. This a wonderful tour about how coins were made. The flags outside represent all of the nations that relies on Canada for it's coinage. Tour is about an hour. One can marvel at the ingenious coins that are on display",
          "I didn't realize how little I know about our coins and the Canadian Mint. The tour was fabulous - we learned about the process in making and shipping coins, including those beautiful coloured ones that are in circulation or available for purchase as a collector's item. Did you",
          "You need to book this tour in advance, I believe. It was really interesting and our guide was excellent. You had to observe everything from a distance, of course, but that didn't detract from the experience. Now to return to the Mint in Ottawa!",
          "I went by myself as I had nothing doing and it was under $10. You get to see from above how all the coins are made! All the flags that fly outside- means that country's currency that is being minted! At the end you get to see a gold bar. I knew that it was going to be heavy but",
          "The tour was not as good as Ottawa, coins are expensive, it is all about the money! The mint is out in the middle of no where. Have to pay 8.00 for the tour . Informative but could add more information. Architectural design was good. Close to the center of canada park which is",

          "You know what, this was a pretty fun tour. I was surprised. But I learned a lot about how coinage (not paper money) is made. I also learned about Canada\u2019s unique contributions to minting coins. There wasn\u2019t a lot hands on parts of the tour...which makes a lot of sense. And there",
          "We arrived at an odd time without a reservation and ended up doing a self-guided tour. If you are interested in money, it's a neat place to visit. The staff were friendly, and they have a very nice gift shop with an assortment of collectible coins.",
          "Our group had a private tour at the mint. Our guide explained what happens at the mint. It is amazing to see how our Canadian money is made. The mint produces 15 million coins daily. The gift shop has every coin that the mint produces for sale.",

          "Our tour of the Mint was enjoyed by all of us. The guide was knowledgeable, well spoken, and humorous. Did you know all Canadian coins have a steel core? This is an easy way to separate our coins from American coins. Just use a magnet. The Mint stamps out coins for more",
          "I went in to get coin sets for Christmas gifts. A wide variety of coin sets at various prices for everyone. While there you can also get a brief view of the processing at a glass window. Worth a visit just to experience it",
          "It is worth the stop to see the commerative and other unique coins in the cases. The tour is very interesting and was fun despite a less than stellar tour guide.",
          "What a fun place, very unexpected tour that was made interesting. You can see how coins are made and it is a fun family experience.",
          "What a great tour. You get to see coins being minted. When driving up you see all the flags for the countries that they produce coins for. They were minting coins for 4 or 5 different countries while I was there. You can actually see everything except the plating process.",

          "Very interesting guided tour to see all of the different steps in the process of making money. We were amazed at how fast the coins are minted. Tour guide was very informative. Plus you can hold a large gold brick in the gift shop - under the watchful eye of a guard.",
          "The building is very nice , staff were very friendly and the tour was fantastic, well worth the stop.",
          "Following a lengthy and complicated set of \"political discussions\" it was decided to locate the new Mint (the existing Mint in Ottawa was antiquated and too small). An \"added bonus\" associated with the new building was that it could more economically source raw materials from",
          "Neat place to spend 1 to 1.5 hours. The 45-minute guided tour charges nominal admission ($15 for a fam of 4), and takes you upstairs to see the actual production line. This is the actual place where all our Canadian circulation coins are produced (the Ottawa one makes the",

          "We visited the Winnipeg mint and took the guided tour, which was free. We went on a Sunday, so we didn't see it in operation, but it was still very interesting and informative. Our guide, Nicole, provided an excellent tour. Really fascinating. (Just a fair warning - I'm a",
          "Coins for many countries in the world are made here. A very nice and informative guided tour worth seeing for all ages. We took our 10 year old grandson and he loved it. The building and landscape itself is fantastic and you can buy souvenirs there to. Especially if you are a",

          "the tour is less than an hour but compresses alot of information in that time. I Found the tour group size a bit too big to really hear the guide well. Quite remarkable place and amazing to find out the volume of coins produced in a day. Does not allow pictures of the",

          "We went on a guided tour of the Mint. The tour guide was friendly and informative. There were a lot of neat little facts that I learned. I would definitely suggest going on a weekday if you can so you can see the actual process of making the coins. Holding a gold bar at the end",
          "A very rewarding experience only in Winnipeg. Definitely a MUST DO. Requires a guided tour to see the inner workings of the mint - best to call ahead to make sure there's room for a time that would work for you. See a gold bar and test the weight difference by lifting a bar of",
          "I went with my 9 year old and 4 year old daughters. We were there mid-week, but still had to wait 45 minutes for our tour. It gave me time to browse the very nice gift shop, but it was beginning to push the limits of the girls' patience. I thought the young lady that did our",
          "Was looking forward to the tour based on other reviews, and it didn\u2019t live up to the hype for me.

          "We went for the tour on a weekend when the mint was not in operation. While it would have been interesting to see running, we still learned a lot and enjoyed the tour. Guide was very knowledgeable, tour was a good length, about an hour. While you are there you can pick up a",
          "We spent an enjoyable couple of hours in the Royal Canadian Mint. A very nice modern building. Be sure to take the tour, which lasts 30-40 minutes and lets you see the entire coin minting process from start to finish. The staff were very friendly. The gift shop was small but",
          "It was the tour of the Royal Canadian Mint I went on in Ottawa that inspired me to visit the sister location while in Winnipeg. To be honest the tour in Winnipeg wasn't quite as novel in comparison, the building looks pretty awesome on the outside but a little dated on the",

          "Not many things you can do as a family that cost a total of $15. The building and grounds are spectacular. Tours run every hour and take 45 minutes. Our guide was knowledgeable and the tour was worthwhile to do. Gift shop offers some interesting souvenirs and special coins for",
          "We visited here on a very hot day-nice to be inside with air conditioning. There is lots of (free!) parking. We tried to book ahead for a tour, but except for an answering machine, nobody answered the phone. Can't complain about the admission price, which includes the tour-it",

          "You have to take a tour to see any real parts of the mint, but it's 45 minutes and depending on what day you visit $4 or $6/ per adult. It produces 15 to 20 million coins a day - so you will be sure to see different coins being Pro tip: Ask the people before you by tickets",

          "We visited on Saturday during a flying visit to Winnipeg and only managed to secure a self guided tour which never really explains what is going on. With no one working as it is a weekend it was not much to look at either. Having visited the Mint in Ottawa we had high hopes",
          "I have been visiting Winnipeg nearly every year for the past 30 years, even lived there for three, and have never visited the Mint! Finally made it this trip! It was a great tour. It wasn\u2019t a long tour or really in-depth, but it wasn\u2019t expensive for our family of five so it",
          "This is an operating high-security facility which is at the same time a museum. It is amazing how they managed to combine this contradictive features in one place! One can see how the loonies and toonies are being made through the glass and additionally the tour guide will tell",

          "Beautiful building and grounds! Driveway bordered by flags from all the countries (76, I think) they have made coins for ... beautiful to see. We did the guided tour with Emily who did an outstanding job explaining and answering our questions. We could've used a few more",
          "Very educational with a tour guide. A Spanish/English interpreter was among our group. It was very interesting to see the assembly line. And fascinating to learn how many countries currency is made here in Winnipeg. Beautiful facility Along with impressive landscaping. This was",

          "This is a great place to go to learn about how coins are made. The Mint has a short tour (approx 45mins) in English or French. It was nice and you could learn all about how they make different kinds of money (don't go on Saturday if you want to see the machines running). Also",

          "This place is a must see when you are travelling through Winnipeg . We learnt alot about our Canadian Coins how they are made to how they are packaged and also the Mint just does not make Canadian Coins but for countries all over the world. That is something to be proud of.",
          "The tour at the Royal Canadian Mint in Winnipeg was very interesting. It was only $6/person for a 40-minute guided tour that takes you along raised corridors, over-looking the Mint's work areas. Lots of good information from the guide.",

          "Picture opp with the gold bar is worth the trip alone. This is the only Canadian federal government institution that actually makes a profit and that's something. The tour thru the working areas is the learning part. There is a gift shop with a good selection of their products.",
          "I have never been to a Mint before, so this was very interesting and informative. I've never really thought how coins are made, but if you want to know, this is the place to visit. They mint coins from all over the world, including their own, and there is some fun history to the",
          "It's an interesting place to visit! I wasn't sure what to expect with the tour, but it was short and informative and you look down into the area that they make the money in while telling you some history and explaining why some of our Canadian coins don't work in U.S. vending",
          "My husband and I have toured other Mints in various countries and I was disappointed by this tour. We received information of course but the way it was delivered could have been better. The guide did not use the videos that were been shown - I think if she would have used the",
          "This was an informative, short tour. I had no idea that Winnipeg even had a mint (let alone that this is the one that makes all of our coins!). Our tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. There was a question asked that she didn't know the answer to, so she went and",
          "Neat to see, might not be the most exciting attraction, but worth the visit that's for sure! Check it out",
          "The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. There was ample parking as well. Tours were a little short but very interesting to see. The gift shop gave me a loonie that had not been in circulation yet as change which I thought was really neat.",

          "Waited about an hour to take a tour of the mint. We were excited to get a behind the scenes look at how Canada manufactures coins for countries around the world. Tour was very limited as there is no access to the factory, only a second story view of the floor behind glass. For",
          "It's pretty interest in watching coin making, especially when I'm collecting the circlar coins. The guide is quite knowledgable.",
          "The guided tour was fine, but canned and quick. You see the mint through observation windows on the 2nd floor. After the tour, we hung around and asked many questions of the tour guides and they were highly knowledgeable and told us much about the mint & Canadian money. They",
          "Whether a citizen of Canada or not, this was very interesting. The guide was quite good and able to answer questions. With large windows from an upper floor large hall, the view of all was wonderful as we watched the actual work of making coins from beginning to end.",
          "The Mint has the potential to be a great place to visit. It has lovely grounds with a moat and geese making their home. It shows rows of flags from the multi nations that have coins produced at this facility. The tour mainly shows different aspects of coin making and is not",
          "It's not everyday that you can see where coins are made.. it's a fun visit. Plenty of beautiful landscaping to enjoy, also. Great for kids, families, or just for yourself. The tour is informative, and just the right length. The Mint is accessible by transit, but the buses",
          "Take a free tour of the mint. You won't regret it. Fascinating to see how your coins get designed and made.",
          "Enjoyed going on the tour of the Mint. It's amazing how many coins are made here, not only for Canada, but many other countries in the world. As you drive up to the parking lot, the flags are displayed of all the countries that they make coins for. It is very impressive! We",
          "The Mint has a great deal of potential but need to overhaul their approach. It can turn out to be boring as it is mostly observing machines that print coins for many countries. The grounds are impressive with a surrounding moat with local water birds. The flags that line the",

          "Located at the corner of Trans Canada Highway number 1 and Highway 59 is one of two Royal Canadian Mints. This one in Winnipeg is solemnly dedicated to coins and medals. Here you can see the medals which were made here for 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Mint is opened to public",

          "Went on a Saturday so none of the equipment was in operation but we were still taken on a very informative tour by Echo, who was a very good guide. At the end they allowed us to \"trade\" one of our loonies for a brand new one that was not yet in circulation in a beautiful",

          "It was a little interesting and a tad boring. Would I go again, no, but it was worth going and seeing it once!",

          "An interesting spot. It is very hands off since you are looking through glass windows. I was surprised to learn that the Mint makes currency for many other countries. This explained the lovely array of flags outside- one for each country for which currency is made.",
          "While we didn't have a lot of time to explore, we found that they had even less set up for exploration. The \"self-guided tour\", was essentially a walk way that overlooked the operations, with a few displays and TVs that were not operational. There was nothing much in the way",
          "Called to inquire about a guided tour, and was told the earliest was 1:30 pm due to school children booked for 11 am, but was offered that we could do our own self tour if we had wanted to, anytime after 11:30 am. The guided tour we were told; is really the exact same as",

          "You should probably drive to the Mint. The nearest bus stop is still a 10-15 minute walk away along a highway. We cut across the goose-occupied lawn to save time. Is it trespassing if you pay for the tour? The tour was short, but informative, and the guide answered all our",

          "Great place to take the family. We went on a self guided tour, but before we went, the tour guide gave us a bit of info on the mint. Very pleased. Did not cost anything to see the mint on your own, however, we were there on a Saturday.",
          "My wife and I took the tour and it could have been done in a lounge somewhere. The young lady conducting the tour really knew what she was talking about however we went around coffee break and even though there really is nothing to see,there was no activity going on at all. An",

          "The Mint requires a tour, which is pretty inexpensive. The guides are great, and the information quick and informative. The gift shop has a nice mix of materials, and although the building is not new, it is still a good place to visit. Only coins are made at this mint, but oh so",

          "We stopped here because it was on our way back t o the hotel, it was about 3:30 pm & the mint closes at 5. We looked around for a few minutes and inquired about the tours. We (as seniors) only had to pay $5 each for a 45 minute tour. It was interesting to see how the coins are",
          "The mint is one of two you can visit in Canada. This one makes only coins [We found out the polymer money making mint doesnt give tours. :( ] It's not a bad drive, $15 for a family...so not expensive (though I swear all the other mints I have been to were free), its handicap",

          "To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when we decided to go to the Mint but after I got there I knew how wrong my perceptions were. It was cool to see the process used for making coins, stamping, etc, during the inexpensive tour we went on while there. Don't miss this if you",

          "Interesting and informative. Tour is about 45 min and guide was great. Encouraged questions and kept things moving. Definitely call and make reservation. We were fortunate to get in last minute but some didn't and tours are about 1.5 hr apart. Certainly worth seeing",

          "My wife and I took the 45 minute tour of the Mint recently and were very pleased that we did. We got there a bit late for a tour that had left 5 minutes earlier and they let us join that tour which we were thankful for. There is a very reasonable admission charge for the tour.",
          "From the time we sighted the stunning building, we knew we were in for a different type of tour. Our tour guide, Brittainy, certainly knew her stuff and kept her cool.(how our coins are made,history,materials used,etc.) In the gift shop one can easily ring up a bill over one",
          "First of all, the building exterior and grounds themselves are very impressive and easy to walk and photograph. You drive down a driveway lined with all the flags of the nations that this facility creates money for. The building interior though is a little bland. Small",

          "The tour of the mint is truly amazing for those who have an interest in the production of international as well as our own Canadian coins. Although very interesting it is not geared toward the very young--though they are welcome. The gift store offers a great selection of coins,",
          "The tour guide was very knowledgeable and could be easily heard. Much like the U.S. Mint, it is difficult to really see the money being made, but it was interesting to watch. If possible, call ahead for a reservation time for the tour.",

          "If you have any interest in money, this is a place you should visit. One of two mints in Canada there is a lot going on to see. The tour is 45 minutes long, but the gift shop is cool to look through as well. Probably spend a bit over an hour there and that would be enough.",
          "fun to see that little metal commodity come to life! Some interesting facts, you probably did not know...must visit.",

          "Gained a good knowledge of how coins are made, and they have tours in both English and French. Photo taking is not allowed, but then it's just big machineries in operation, so there's nothing interesting to take a picture of. I'm sure only good, honest people can work there",

          "Arrived a little early for the tour. There were enough activities and displays to keep us busy. My husband went ahead and did the self guided tour on the second level as well. The women showing the items for sale were very knowledgeable and friendly. Wish I would have bought one",
          "The mint was great but the tour guide lacked the honesty and personality for the job. Other wise very interesting place to visit.",
          "I had never been- so felt it was long overdue. I think you have to go when there is some sort of production work going on. We were there when there was nothing happening. It was \"adequate\". i may have to give it a second chance.",

          "Learned a lot about coin minting, and the guide was excellent... very knowledgeable. A beautiful building with many fascinating areas.",
          "On our trip to Winnipeg, we finally visited the mint. This is where they make coins for all over the world, I don't believe this is where they print the bills, just coins. There were some interactive displays on the main floor for my 9 year olds, but through the tour they were",
          "There are only two places in Canada minting money - Ottawa and Winnipeg. You can see the actual place making money. And sometimes they displace the real goldbar, and you can touch and lift it. But don't try to take it. :-)",
          "We went on a Sunday. We did a self tour but it would have been much better if there was activity in the Mint. I will go back during a week day.",
          "I liked the fact they have handicapped parking close to the door. It was an interesting experience which travelers should take the time to visit. There was nothing that I didn't like about the mint.",

          "Spend an hour at the Mint in the 'Peg - worth your while. The 45 minute tour is very informative, call in advance to book your space - no waiting on arrival. Group size was a bit too big, hard to hear the guide sometimes over the chatting kiddies. Age appropriate might be 6-7",
          "I had lived in Winnipeg for almost 20 years before moving out West but had never visited the Mint. The tour was very affordable and informative. My husband and I enjoyed it immensely. Not a good fit for young children but for those over 10 would find it interesting as well.",
          "There is no doubt the tour was informative and educational but it was not much different than reading an article about coins production. Though some of the machines were working, they were so far that you rely on the information of tour guide. It would be much better if we could",

          "When in Winnipeg highly recommend setting aside time in your plans to include visiting the the Mint. See not only where your money (coins) is actually made but also how, check schedule for when the tours are available. Careful as they make \u2026",
          "Great place. Good tour",

        "wiki": "Winnipeg ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America.\nThe city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2016, Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500. Being far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F).Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWinnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as \"The Forks\". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.Sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the M\u00e9tis because of sharing a traditional culture.\n\nLord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M\u00e9tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.In 1869\u201370, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of M\u00e9tis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. M\u00e9tis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1900\u2013present) ===\nBy 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.\n\nMore than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled \"Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise\" (commonly known as the \"Golden Boy\"). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nIn the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan \"unicity\" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011, in each of these floods, the Red River Floodway was used to safely protect the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWinnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of 464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around \u221216.4 \u00b0C (2.5 \u00b0F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in).

          "I was really contemplating giving the Children's Museum 4 stars instead of 3........because my son thoroughly enjoyed it!! However it isn't amazing...I think its pretty average. The museum is situated next to the Forks, and is quite an impressive looking building. It is quite",
          "Went the same day as the Museum of Human Rights and was shocked that this cost more for our family of 5. It\u2019s one large room, and we spent about 1.5 hours and our kids were done. Seen and did it all.",
          "We took our grandson to this museum and he was looking forward to it. It was $11 for adults as well as kids. He is 9 and really there was only one or two exhibits that interested him and the rest were hohum. As an adult we found the exhibits not really interesting for him as",
          "Took a 2 year old to the museum based on recommendations from family. Well worth the visit. Paid $11.00 per person (even child). Worth the money as hours of activities are available along with complimentary parking for 3 hours. They will extend the parking for you if you ask.",
          "We took our grandson (soon to be 3 years old) to the Children's Museum for the morning. He had so much fun playing with the other kids and trying to figure out how some of the centers work. He thoroughly enjoyed Tapescape, the water centre, the air centre where he watched",
          "This place is pretty huge and offers a lot of stuff to do :) From Kids to Adults! We paid $33 for 2 Adults and 1 2 years old with a 3 hour complimentary parking :)",

          "This museum is a great interactive fun for all kids of all ages including us kids at heart a must see winnipeg attraction",
          "This museum is located within the Folks historic site and next to the Folks Market. It has a nice huge model train, huge play area and educational toys for sale. It helps kids with their mental and social development. Must go place for kids.",
          "Had a great family/cousins visit with 4 kids 6 and under, spent almost half our visit in the LEGO section, would love to go back (and so would the kids!)",
          "The Museum, now located in \"The Forks\" area, was created by a small group of dedicated people in 1983, moved in to its first building in 1986. It has had several major expansions-- the most recent being in 2011, when, on the 25th anniversary, twelve more galleries and a welcome",
          "Great spot for getting out of the sun and heat. Lots for younger kids to do although my 8 year old enjoyed the shift in activity",
          "This is a great place for a 3 year old to explore and have creative play time. We were there for 2 hours but could have stayed longer.",
          "This is a fantastic place for children to run aroun, explore and create! My only complaint would be that there isn\u2019t much for food available to purchase on site.",
          "I hate giving bad reviews, but this was a complete waste of our time and money... 35$ for a 4 y.o and 2 adults is way too much... My daughter didn't care for the place. The stations are old and not very interesting... I won't return and I wouldn't recommend, go spend your money",
          "It is a good place to bring a young child with different activities for them to do. More care should be taken by staff to control action of older kids as it is hard for the really young ones to enjoy when the olde4 ones overpower them for the positions.",
          "Great place to take kids but the price is beyond ridiculous. They don't care about the local community with those prices!",
          "We attended actually two days in a row. The first day was with our daughter and grandson. He enjoyed it so much that we went again the next day! Again we spent 3 hours of entertainment. Our grandson especially love the digger and the train.",
          "We spent about 3 hours here with our 3 and 7 year old daughters. They had fun running from activity to activity. Free parking when you pay admission. There aren't many options for food but you can bring your own or buy some sandwiches from the gift shop. Nice to check out",
          "Had not been for sometime since our kids have grown up. Re visited when family was visiting from Ontario. This place is fantastic with so many things to do wuth the kids. It was a nice day so it was busy but did not have to wait long for our guests to have the kids interact.",
          "This was our second visit. As the kids get older they interact with the exhibits in new ways. Very enjoyable.",
          "Technically this is less of a museum and more of a play place with some educational components. We came early on a Wednesday morning with our 4 yr and 22 month old grandchildren. This was our second visit this summer with them and they had more fun this time. There were not",
          "This delightful, interactive Museum was a result of the energy and foresight of a small group of parents-- who created the Museum-- wholly with the support of the community [after its great success the government has played a role]. Children love the displays and the",
          "I wish we lived here so that we could visit all the time. We would buy a membership! Staff were friendly and helpful. The facility appeared clean and tidy. Kids had a lot of fun playing in all the different stations. We will def go back. Price was decent, also we could leave",
          "I visit the children's museum at least once a year and lover how there is always something new. A word of caution to visitors at the Forks there is no longer free parking. Feel free to pack a lunch / snacks as the museum has a clean area to enjoy your food. I love the fact that",
          "Nice open space with many different areas for kids to play and learn. Many opportunities for kids to be hands on. Easy for adults to follow the kids or sit back and watch them play.",
          "I love bringing my kids to this awesome place. Weekend is always busy which is fine, but be careful with small kids because they can get overcrowded quite fast. Amnywho... Very cute museum fo kids.",
          "We have taken our kids here every time we visit Winnipeg. Good activities for younger kids -- maybe 3-7. My kids are \"growing out\" of the museum.",
          "My 4 year old daughter loves the children's museum. She loves the tubes that suck in the fuzz balls (not sure what it was called) she was kind of disappointed that she couldn't get up on the play structure since she was too short. Wish it were a bit bigger with more activities",
          "There is so much here to keep your little ones busy. Very interactive! There is an area for babies/toddlers for those with really young ones.",
          "So interactive and fun,from playing in the water to creating crafts and exploring our grandson as well as us adults had a day of complete fun",
          "Boston and New York inspired, but it has local stuff too! Best for kids aged 6 to 16. Lots of hands-on exhibits. Good food at low prices.",
          "Love spending time here with grandkids. They never get tired of it. Having memberships for everyone is a great deal. Especially with all the perks of a membership Memberships are a great gift to give!! Really appreciate the good place for eating the food you have brought. So",
          "We took our little girl (3 1/2) and she wasn't too impressed. We went Sunday of May long and since it was raining it was very busy. Maybe it would've been more fun on a quieter day, but we did not feel it was worth it. Spent less than an hour looking around and called it a day.",
          "I don't think I have been in the Children's Museum for over 10 years.. I went for an adults comedy night for a fundraiser for the Children's Museum.. the comedy night was great! $25 for entertainment and pizza (drinks were extra) In between sets you could walk around the museum",
          "I haven't been to the museum since the tree slide was removed. I miss the tree slide. I found it to not have alot to do. If it wasn't for the earth day activities we probably would of let earlier. The kids liked the earth day stuff available. The crafts and planting a tree. I",
          "Most of the the time will be fun but if you are over the age of 5 most of the activitys will be dull and all you will hear is yelling screaming and get a head ache. Some of the activitys are gearm infested desiese holes. In the end you child will get sick and yo7 will get a",
          "When our Children and grandchildren visited from the States, we were already at the Forks Market and decided we would go as a group to the Children's Museum. We had two sets of parents, one teenager, one 9 year old, two preschoolers and of course, us Grandparents. The younger",
          "This is a great place for kids. Lots of educational exhibits and activities. A must fo 3-8 year olds. Highly recommended.",
          "Have been to this museum several times. Several times with our grandchildren. Couple times with friends who used to live in this city. and with friends who came to our city for the first time.",
          "Offers a wide variety of activities and play for kids of different ages. It is on the pricy side, so plan to go for the day. There is an area for eating snacks you bring and lockers for a cost.",
          "my daughter takes our young man (7) to this museum all the time kids love it there are all kinds of things to do and see and lots of places to visit /eat /snack",
          "Grandchildren 3 & 6.. the 6 year old enjoyed climbing through the structure but the 3 year old did not meet the height safety restriction. Both had fun on the slide. Other than that they were not interested in the few other things there were to do. It was our first time and I",
          "Took my grandchild to see the mechanical display which I had taken my children to see at the Eaton's store over 30 years ago.It was heart warming to see the display again with my grandson.Apparently the display is 100 years old.My grandson also enjoyed very much using the",
          "At first glance, the Children's Museum looks as though you could make your way through it in 30 minutes. I advise you to let the museum prove you wrong. After multiple visits, I am still finding more activities every time and the kids never want to leave! Great for large groups",
          "I really like the atomsphere in the MCM. It's always nice to see a museum that is hands on for kids rather than hands off as happens far too often. Take your children there you and they will really like it.",
          "Grandkids age 5 and 7 like to go there. When busy the noise level is hard to bear. Very expensive for what is on offer.",
          "attended a grand kid's birthday party there and it was great. Lots of fun things for the kids to see, do and touch adults as well. Staff was very helpful as well in staging the event.",
          "Absolutely amazing!!! It's totally family day out. So much to do for kids, exploring different things, science, fun etc. Fun Fun, Fun!!! And also fantastic playground few steps away :)",
          "At first, $11 per person over one year old may seem steep, but after a complete renovation just a few years ago, the value for money is definitely on par. With twins under two, we sure appreciated the \"Tot Spot\", with age appropriate activities for little ones in a gated area.",
          "My grand-kids had fun -.lots to do for a few hours interesting displays and lots of interactive toys no discount for seniors",
          "We have a membership, and unfortunately I do not enjoy bringing my one year old twins here (especially on my own). I regret activating our membership while they are so young, I should have waited until they were at least two or closer to three. Our last visit was during summer",
          "My kids love this place. We spent a lot of time there. We were lucky it was low season and spent time at each station. We spent a lot of time doing crafts. Do not miss if you have kids.",
          "Lots to do and lots of kids. A great location to pass the afternoon with your children. If you're going to be doing this a number of times, consider getting a yearly pass to save yourself some money and to opportunistically jump in the car. Other distractions at the Forks for",
          "Fun way to spend a few hours, geared towards young children (teenagers would be bored). Two hours max, place is not very large. Love the train that sticks half way out the building. Location at the Forks is convenient as you can do other things as well and make a day of it. For",
          "Went with my sister and her 2, 4, 6, and 10 year old kids! All the kids had tons of fun, with age appropriate places to play for each of them. The train, craft area, and little gated off section for 2 and under were all big hits. It was well worth the admission price, and we",

          "I didn't find there was a lot to do there. School trip students had decimated the craft ares leaving nothing for others to do. The slide and tunnels were fun but got old quickly. The train took a minute to go through as there was not much to it. Only one small area for two or",

          "Children's museum is a great way to spend an afternoon. Located in The Forks, it offers a hands on fun-filled outing for the young & young at heart. So many educational but fun things for all ages.",
          "Probably the highlight of the trip! I was a bit sceptical as I have 3 high energy, relatively-low attention boys who love being active. I didn't want this to turn out to be too boring. I was wrong. The museum isn't huge (my boys complained about having to walk so much at the",
          "This place is amazing for kids and even I have fun there. If its raining or just whatever, take the kids here on a weekend or something and let them just be kids and actually it helps in so many ways. Its a great place to visit in Winnipeg in the Winter if its cold or raining",
          "it is ok but nothing special for the price. The play structure is way to big for little kids. If your kid is not 4 feet tall they will never get in the play structure which will disappointment them. There is not much for younger kids. Lots of open space with nothing. Really",
          "We enjoyed an afternoon at the Children's Museum recently and had a wonderful time. We were there after many school groups had left so we had lots of space and time to explore. Very kid friendly, adults can have fun too! Would recommend to anyone with children, seeking a fun",
          "Went there today to check it out for the first time. I heard it had been renovated and let me say that it seems like they did a great job. We had a 5 year old, 2 year old and 14 month old and there was something for all of them. Of course there were more interesting activities",
          "Kids were excited to visit, was pretty decent overall but many of the rides/ attractions did not work or were in a poor state of repair. Needs more TLC to get it up to standards",
          "I went there today and they turned me away because I wasn't there with a kid. I went there back in the early 90s to see the lego display with my brother and we were both in our 20s. We were allowed admission...I understand the museum is for children, but if you are a paying",
          "Lots of stuff, very hands on for kids. There is a section where you sit and eat at tables if you brought your own lunches which is nice. Lots of room to hang jackets and park strollers so you don't have to lug all your junk around. My kids had a great time here",
          "When our children were really young we took them here they loved it. They did a renovation and we came back. The kids did not like it as much as they were older, but their younger cousins thought it was great. I don't think we will be back again unless we have friends or",
          "A few of our families have been refused entry with a respite worker as they are \"too old\" for the museum. Come over sometime and see us watching children's shows and let's talk about \"age\". If our kids are under 18 they should then have a special time to come to the museum if",

          "We have been a few times and my kids love it! There is lots of things to do for all ages. They especially love the slide and the craft area. My only complaint that I wish they had a small restaurant or some place for the kids to eat then keep on playing.",
          "Always a fun place for young children! All the exhibits are highly interactive but a favourite has always been the lasagna climbing structure in the far corner of the museum...the kids could spend an entire day on there. Infants have a designated playspace and kids up to age",
          "This is a great day to spend with your kids or grandkids. Visit and play in the morning, walk over to the forks for lunch and return to play in the afternoon.",
          "What a great place to enjoy the afternoon with the granddaughters!! Play and play and explore!!! Lots of fun!! Lockers are a bit expensive and they should advise parents that each time u need to get into the locker you have to keep putting a loonie in it!",
          "As soon as you walk in, you're immediately aware of open space everywhere. Lots of activities for kids and a sitting area with tables off to the side. There's also a small souvenir shop. Not sure if it's because of the vastness of space, but it just didn't have the same vibe as",

          "We had occasion to go to the Children's Museum in December as part of a Christmas party. It is sad to say that the museum prices itself out of lower income families ability to enjoy the place. They charge everyone from one year of age - 101 years of age $11 + GST apiece to get",

          "This Children's Museum was adored by my children, ages 3 and 6 at the time. It is in a big warehouse-type setting, so getting from place to place is very easy. In the center of the museum is a large train that my son LOVED to go up inside. There is the usual \"water\" play area",

          "I along with my wife were allowed entry to the Museum despite not having children with us. We later found out that this is contrary to their rules and should not have been allowed to happen. As a result we felt somewhat out of place and only had a quick look round basically it",
          "Visited the museum this morning with our three young kiddos. (5, 3 and 11 month old) We hadn't been in a few years so this was new for our kids. Well, they could have stayed all day! Upon arriving we were reminded that the entrance fee is quite steep. At around 45$ for all of",
          "Children's museum is discriminatory. I thought it was a museum open to the public. It is not that way. If you are a childless adult you are not allowed into the museum. If you are a child without an adult you are not allowed into the museum. I am a childless adult and was",
          "I have been to a fair number of Children's Museums all over North America and this ranks as the worst. The layout is terrible - particularly if you are there alone with two young children. While most other children's museum have semi-contained spaces that allow children's",
          "Overall a nice museum for kids to run and play in. Convenient because it's right at the Forks. Lockers are available so on a hot summer day a family could stroller through and visit other venues around the building. Bathrooms are fairly accessible, with water fountains to",

          "I took my two young grandsons here, by myself. What was I thinking? Well, it was great. They go in, and take off. Running around for hours. They check in with me regularly and then off they go. It is a great facility. Lots of interactive stations and things to climb up, into,",
          "Went here while visiting family and hadnt been myself for 25 years, still a great place! It is a bit expensive so bring a lunch and really make a day of it (you can get a stamp so you can pop over to the forks for a bite and come back in too). Areas are really well maintained",
          "the Children's Museum is misnamed. We took our granddaughters (aged 9 and 5) there last summer and there were only two exhibits that really caught their attention. The wall with the 'eyes' in it that they could raise and lower the 'eyelids' and look down on us. The best",

          "Went here a few days ago with my 13 month old. Had not been in years and was very disappointed. First of all everyone who is 1 year and older is charged the same price of $10.50. Obviously a 1 year old and 6 year old would be able to take part in the available activities to",
          "I went with family which included my niece who was about 1-1/2 years old. She had a great time and so did we! Make sure if you are checking out the water tables to put on an apron first. We missed them and she was totally drenched!",
          "This place is awesome. Went here with our 3 year old abs he had an amazing time. The exhibits and the play areas are very stimulating. The entry tickets are very reasonably priced. Definitely a must see if you have young kids.",
          "There seems to be less to see and do. It's one big, noisy space instead of separate areas, so not as fun as discovering each different area. I would say it's geared more to toddlers and kids up to age 7.",
          "This was our second children's museum trip. This one had a less things than the one in Lincoln, Nebraska, but our son had a better time at the Winnipeg museum. Our child spent 90 minutes there and he still talks about it 2 weeks later. We will definitely be making the trip",
          "Our kids love to go to the Children's Museum. They are 5 and 8 and there is something for both of them. We have been to a few birthday parties here as well. They are very well run and the party rooms are nice and spacious. There is lots of opportunity to run and burn off some",
          "kids love to come lots to do, even as a child it was one of my fav things to do. Lots of DIFFERENT types of activities and close to the forks. You can have a whole day event here and within its vicinity.",

          "This museum was very interesting, especially geared towards kids. There is plenty to learn if you spend the time reading to your kids. There's so much to do that it's hard to keep track of the kids as they go from each learning centre. The water centre and the train was a hit",
          "Took three kids ages 5 and 3 to this museum today. They had a good time. Be careful in the water area. Have your kids wear the smocks but be ready to dry their shoes and socks. Lots of interesting areas and the real train was a hit for my kids. Not as big as the one in St.",
          "We were surprised how inventive the new play ground next to the museum was. There was a children size train to ride. Also various piece luggage were scattered about. A big plus was the soft rubber ground that the playground was on.",
          "Not worth the hype. Everyone said it was a great place but really It was just a play place. Kids didn't learn anything. Parents didn't watch their kids properly which annoyed the heck out of me. The craft station was full of garbage and barely any supplies. And the costumes the",
          "Shouldnt be called a museum, its a play place thats all it is now. Nothing from the past to be learnt here,everybit of history is gone except the building structure. The train looks like a mcdonalds inside now, and whats with the pasta structure? Not as many activities as the",
          "I took my 1 and a half year old and did not know if she would have much fun being the age she was. There was so much things she could do, and she had so much fun. I would take her back, and I think as she gets older she will have more fun.",
          "No matter how many times I go to the museum with my grandchildren, it is always a lot of fun! There is something for every age, from 1 year olds to 12 year olds. My grandchildren (ages 1,3,5) love all the areas, but especially the train, the climbing structure, the water table,",
          "As a preschool teacher I didn\u00b4t have high expectations to this place.. but I was wrong! The museum encourages kids to be creative in play and research. The have a water playing area that our one year old LOVED, and has so much potential for the kids. Then they have a craft",
          "My kid just loved this place! She was playing, eating cake (birthday of the museum) and dancing with the other kids. It was a fun place for her during our long travel through Canada. You can discover and learn a lot of things. It's close to a need shopping center with good",
          "We visited this location recently while visiting Winnipeg for a wedding. The kids were excited and honestly I was excited to bring them. However, I would not go back again, nor would I refer this place to friends. There is not a lot to do here. What was more annoying was",
          "We came right when it opened on Saturday at 930 and it was a great time to come so it wasn't crowded. The children loved running around playing with the water and in the lasagna lookout. As an adult, I noticed a few things which made the experience less desirable. The place",
          "This is a fantastic place for children to play, learn and experiment with all kinds of things. Although it's pricey, it's good to see it at least once. There are so many intriguing things for the kids to check out. I think you can also arrange to have birthday parties there.",
          "My kids always LOVE going to this museum. Tons of interaction and lots of fun and learning to be had. Bring your own snacks unless you want to plug away at the vending machine. Haven't been there since it was re-done with new displays but it's probably even better! Park for",

          "I went here with my girlfriend and her little daughter who is just under 3. While the little girl adored it, she would probably have got just as much pleasure from a public open-air playground! I think the exhibits are too 'serious' to be fun, but not educational enough for it",

          "If you have been to the Children's Museum in Winnipeg in years past, don't expect the new renovations to be an improvement. The cool stuff my kids loved when they were small is all gone: the giant tree/forest animal climbing area, for instance: wah!! Now the displays are all",
          "Very well maintained, small area to sit in and no one complained when I brought out a snack for my granddaughter. She is 2 and we've been there 3 times this year - a great afternoon or morning if it's raining. Only drawback is in june when the place is full of school groups.",

          "I took my nephews here (3,5 yrs). They both loved it. I thought the old Children's Museum was great but this one really impressed me! So much variety + its educational + good fun. I will definitely bring them back sometime. I think children under 3 would get a lot less out",
          "Expensive and pretentious! Poor art supplies and even the infant play area is poorly designed. Not sure what the designers were thinking creating so many single child activities... Especially the useless crane section. Just an example of how much my daughter disliked this",

          "If your kids even yourself want to keep busy, esp. during the winter season; this place is a worthwhile. Just let the kids go loose and enjoy the hands on experience of touching, pretending and just being themselves. Easy to stay there for 2 hours or more. Just relax and let",

          "I took my five grandchildren ages 6 to 1year there. It was an expensive afternoon we will not be repeating! They want all children to be supervised yet charge the adults full admission at $10. Safety was not a priority with the new slide which ends on a hard floor with no",

The price is affordable and you could even go back and forth for the whole day! How awesome is that! The place is clean and well ventilated. Would go back again and highly recommended.",

          "I guess it's ok but there really is like nothing there",
          "A great place to take the kids for an afternoon. It's more of a science center than a museum - all about discovery and thinking about the way the world works. Great experience.",
          "Great place for young children (babies  up to maybe the age of 8) to explore and run around",
          "The staff there are nice and friendly and greet you as you walk in. They serve you nicely and always with a smile. It's a nice warm and welcoming place as you come in. Great place to bring your kids if you have any. They are bound to have a good time while spending their time there.",

          "Friendly staff, crazy kids.  Be prepared to run after your child as they go crazy.",
          "Pretty fun and hands-on, even some good exercise with the current installations. Don't expect to learn much. Our eldest was considered too big for the main play structure, and our youngest a little small to go in by herself, but there was still enough to keep them occupied and enthusiastic for an hour or two.",
          "They are under a bit of construction right now, not it's a good place to go with a 2-4 year olds. My little man is 2 years old and he loves running around here.",

          "If you ever visited any other children's museum you will be disappointed. Here is just a playground like in any McDonald's for free. Very small and nothing at all worth looking at. I visited Calgary children's museum and another one in Indianapolis USA. After those awesome places this as just one huge disappointment. ",

        "wiki": "Downtown Winnipeg is an area of the city located near the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. It is the oldest urban area in Winnipeg, and is home to the city's commercial core, city hall, the seat of Manitoba's provincial government, and a number of major attractions and institutions.\nThe City of Winnipeg's official downtown boundaries are: the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline on the north, Gomez Street and the Red River on the east, and the Assiniboine River on the south. The western boundaries are downtown are irregular, following along a number of different streets, back lanes, and across properties.   Generally speaking, the western boundaries are rarely further west of Balmoral and Isabel Streets. In 2016, Canadian Geographic produced a map that generalize Winnipeg's downtown boundaries.Neighbourhoods in the downtown area include the Exchange District, Central Park, The Forks, and Chinatown. The downtown area is roughly three square kilometres. Winnipeg Square, Bell MTS Place, Portage Place, and the flagship store of the Bay are all located on the downtown section of Portage Avenue. On Main Street are Winnipeg's City Hall, Union Station, and the Manitoba Centennial Centre, which includes the Manitoba Museum, the Planetarium, the Centennial Concert Hall and the Winnipeg Railway Museum. Although over 60,000 people work downtown, only 13,470 people actually live in the Downtown area.There are several residential projects under construction on Waterfront Drive and in the Exchange District, and the residential population of the area is projected to increase substantially in the next few years.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\nThe Downtown Winnipeg Zoning By-Law defines the boundaries of the Downtown planning area, and several sectors within it. The downtown census area is slightly smaller, omitting a three-block extension at the north edge. There is also a significantly larger Downtown community area, used for Community Social Data Strategy for Winnipeg.\n\n\n=== Waterfront District ===\n\nThe Waterfront District is a newly emerging district located in the northeast corner of downtown Winnipeg. The area runs along the west bank of the Red River along the recently built Waterfront Drive and features Stephen Juba Park.\nThe Waterfront district has seen a number of residential construction projects since 2005.There are plans to extend Waterfront Drive further north, to connect it with the Disraeli Fwy. Developer Leon A. Brown is offering up to 12 properties for redevelopment in the area.Sunstone Boutique Hotels had an $11-million plan to build a three-storey, 67-room boutique hotel on what is now a gravel parking lot, along with a new casual-dining restaurant in the one-storey brick former Harbourmaster's building. The plans also involve construction of a public plaza area at the south end of the property.\n\n\n=== Central Park ===\n\nCentral Park is one of Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhoods with 13,755 people per square km according to Statistics Canada's 2001 Census. Seventy per cent of all refugees coming to Winnipeg live downtown, in and around the Central Park area. Central Park includes many different ethnicities including Arabs, Vietnamese, Chinese, Ojibway, Filipinos, and African (more than half being African).\nWith the increase in the African population, Central Park has been transforming in recent years. It is now the home to the 'Central Market', with more markets planned to come. Many of the markets will sell handmade fashion and imported African crafts.\nDuring warm Saturday nights, live entertainment fills the air, residents enjoy free Sunday movie screenings to enjoy an evening outdoors. The Knox Centre at Knox United Church presents international films in various languages - with English subtitles - every Thursday evening.\n\n\n=== Exchange District ===\n\nThe Exchange District is a National Historic Site of Canada. Just one block north is one of Canada's most famous intersections, Portage and Main, the Exchange District comprises twenty city blocks and approximately 150 heritage buildings, and it is known for its intact turn-of-the-century collection of warehouses, financial institutions, and early terra cotta clad skyscrapers.Winnipeg's theatre district is located on the east side of the Exchange District, home to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, and Centennial Concert Hall which houses the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the Manitoba Opera. The west side of the Exchange is home to Cinematheque, a small movie theatre located in the Artspace building on Albert Street.The Exchange District's Old Market Square annually hosts the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and the Manitoba Electronic Music Exhibition. Renovations to Old Market Square completed in 2012 added \"The Cube\", a $1.5 million stage, with a skin made up of 20,000 aluminum links. The stage contains a built-in lighting system, green room and two performance levels.The district is home to Red River College's Roblin Centre and Paterson Globalfoods Institute.\n\n\n=== Broadway-Assiniboine ===\nBroadway-Assiniboine lies in the southern part of downtown on the north bank of the Assiniboine River. The neighbourhood is one of the more densely populated in Winnipeg, with 15,452.2 people per square kilometre. It features many notable landmarks such as the historic Upper Fort Garry, Hotel Fort Garry and the Manitoba Legislative Building. Broadway-Assiniboine features the \"Assiniboine Riverwalk\" and is home to many notable restaurants.\nThe population of Broadway-Assiniboine was 5,270 as of the 2016 Census. The most common transportation method of the people in South Portage is walking, with 31.8%, more than 6.5 times higher than the overall 4.9% for Winnipeg. The average employment income for the area is just $47,268, which is lower than Winnipeg's average employment income of $61,164.Current plans are for a new bicycle-pedestrian bridge to connect McFadyen Park with Fort Rouge Park over the Assiniboine River. The bridge would be partly financed by a grant from the Winnipeg Foundation. There are three designs vying for final approval.\n\n\n=== The Forks ===\n\nThe Forks is a 99-acre (40 ha) national historic, recreational, cultural and entertainment area site located in downtown Winnipeg where the Assiniboine and Red Rivers meet. The Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity.\n\n\n=== South Portage ===\nSouth Portage is the group of blocks located between Portage Avenue, Main Street, Broadway and Memorial Boulevard.\nThe population of South Portage was 1,865 as of the 2016 Census. The most common transportation method of the people in South Portage is walking, with 42.4%, more than five times higher than the overall 4.9% for Winnipeg. The average employment income for the area is just $52,267, which is lower than Winnipeg's average employment income of $61,164.South Portage is the location of the main branch of the Winnipeg Public Library system, the Millennium Library.The area also has the Winnipeg Convention Centre with 160,000 sq ft (15,000 m2) of meeting, exhibition and banquet space. Lakeview Square, the largest mixed-use development downtown in the 1970s, was constructed at the same time as the Convention Centre and completed in 1974. \nOpened in 2004, Winnipeg's MTS Centre is located just south of Portage Avenue and is home to the Winnipeg Jets.The area also has the Norquay Building, the Law Courts, cityplace mall and VJ's Drive Inn. There are numerous office buildings and hotels in this area, including some of Winnipeg's tallest buildings.\nA 42-storey apartment building, 300 Main, is currently being built by Artis REIT, owners of 360 Main St. and Winnipeg Square. When completed, it will be the tallest apartment block in the city.\nWinnipeg's public transit hub is located on the Graham Avenue Transit Mall, as many bus routes converge there.\n\n\n=== Chinatown ===\n\nFormed in 1909, the area is home to many shops and restaurants including Asian grocery stores and an herbal products store.Winnipeg's Chinatown covers 0.1 square kilometres (0.039 sq mi) northwest of City Hall and is home to about 600 people, of whom 90% are in the Chinese visible minority group. 40.5% of the area's residents speak neither English nor French (as compared to 1% of Winnipeg as a whole), while 71.1% of residents speak some variant of Chinese (including Cantonese, Mandarin and Chinese not otherwise specified).\n\n\n== River crossings ==\n\nDowntown Winnipeg has four bridges that directly connect to other Winnipeg neighbourhoods or suburbs across the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. They are the Main Street Bridge, Midtown Bridge, Osborne Street Bridge, and the Provencher Bridge.\nOne of the first bridges in Winnipeg was the Main-Norwood Bridge. It carries traffic between St. Boniface, St. Vital and points east from Marion St. Originally a toll bridge, it carried Winnipeg's first horse-drawn streetcars between downtown and River Ave. in the early 1880s.\nOsborne Street Bridge connects Osborne Village to the downtown core. The first iteration was built in the late 1880s. In the 2010s the bridge was upgraded with a lit wall using LED technology.\nThe Midtown Bridge carries traffic to and from south Winnipeg. It was first opened in September 1955. The Bridge sees upwards of 59,300 vehicles average weekdays.The Provencher Bridge is the third one built. The first version, called the Broadway Bridge, was not engineered correctly and fell into the Red River four days after opening due to ice jams colliding with it. The second version outlived its usefulness and was replaced in the 2000s. The new Provencher Bridge opened to vehicular traffic in December 2003. Located adjacent to the Provencher Bridge is the cable-stayed pedestrian and cycling bridge, Esplanade Riel, opened in 2004. It features space for an indoor restaurant.\n\n\n== Sports venues ==\nThere are two major sports venues located downtown, BellMTS Place where the NHL's Winnipeg Jet and Manitoba Moose have played since 2004, and Shaw Park where the American Association's Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball team have played since 1999.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Walkway System ==\n\nThe Winnipeg Walkway System, popularly known as the Winnipeg Skywalk, is a network of pedestrian skyways and tunnels connecting a significant portion of the city centre.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nSeveral media organizations have broadcasting studio located in the downtown area, including television stations CTV, Global, Citytv, and Canadian specialty channel APTN, radio stations QX104, and 93.7 Nostalgia FM.\nThe television broadcast antennas for CBC Television Manitoba and ICI Radio-Canada Manitoba are located on the Richardson Building, while Global Tv Winnipeg is located on top of 201 Portage Ave.\nBorder Crossings, an internationally known arts magazine featuring Canadian art, publishes from offices in the Exchange District. Where Winnipeg magazine features listings of things to do in Winnipeg and is also published from the Exchange District.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIsbister School is an Adult Education Centre operated by the Winnipeg School Division in the north Portage Avenue area.Other private schools serve business needs, such as CDI and Booth College.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Winnipeg\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Winnipeg Site\nDowntown Winnipeg Zoning By-law No. 100/2004\nCentreVenture Site\nDowntown Winnipeg Plan (1969)\nDowntown Winnipeg BIZ Site",

          "This is a very small square in the older part of Winnipeg city that located just off Main street and a short distance from Portage Avenue, the main shopping street. It is surrounded by some old buildings and unique retail shops. Got some benches for you to sit. Don't waste",

          "Market Square is an awesome spot to kick back in the summer; however even in winter it has a magical calm in the middle of downtown. They've done a reasonable job clearing the snow off the sidewalks but there are still a few 'ice traps' that could lead to a wipe out, especially",
          "Some great souvenir shops, \"hole in the wall\" style eateries & good restaurants, however 2 places deserve special mentions - Tall Grass Prairie Bakery & Fools & Horses coffee shop. The bakery is worth a visit not only for the amazing baked goods, but also because of the history",

          "very small on this particular Sunday. The music was nice; fun to watch the small kids dance. Food options seemed to focus on fast food; no healthy options. My fav part was on the other side; local artists displaying their wares. Mostly jewelry, clothing and handbags. Very",

          "Its a bit of stretch to say this is a great place to kick back and enjoy the downtown during the winter months, but with spring upon us the magic opens up. A great spot to people watch, grab some food from the many options in the area and sit outside and enjoy. Even better in",
          "This is one of my favorite areas of Winnipeg. So many cool things to see and great architecture. The problem is it feels dead 90% of the time. The city needs to do a better job utilizing this space, especially during the winter months. This could be a beautifully lit winter",

        "wiki": "Saint Boniface Cathedral (French: Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Boniface) is a Roman Catholic basilica and the cathedral of Saint Boniface, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is an important building in Winnipeg, and is the principal church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface, serving the eastern part of Manitoba province as well as the local Franco-Manitoban community. The basilica sits in the centre of the city at 190 avenue de la Cath\u00e9drale, Saint Boniface.\nThe Cathedral faces the Red River. In Verendrye Park is a statue of Pierre La V\u00e9rendrye by Joseph-\u00c9mile Brunet. Across the river is The Forks in Downtown Winnipeg. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1818, newly arrived Rev. Norbert Provencher and two colleagues constructed the first church on land on the east bank of the Red River donated by Hudson's Bay Company's Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk. The  small log building measured 50 feet by 30 feet and served as chapel, residence and school. It was soon replaced with a larger building. In 1832, Provencher, now bishop, built the first cathedral. \"The bells of St. Boniface\" are mentioned in John Greenleaf Whittier's 1859 poem \"The Red River Voyageur\". \"On December 17, 1891, Whittier's 84th birthday, Archbishop Tach\u00e9 had \"the bells of the Roman mission\" rung in the poet's honour.\"\n\nOn December 14, 1860, a fire destroyed \"Provencher\u2019s cathedral\". In 1862, Bishop Tach\u00e9 went to Quebec to raise funds to rebuild the cathedral in stone. This second cathedral was somewhat smaller; the bell tower was completed eight years later. \nBetween 1888 and 1906, the number of Catholics in Saint Boniface had increased from 2,154 to 4,615, almost all of them of French heritage. By 1900, Saint Boniface was the fifth-largest city in the West and needed a larger cathedral. Local contractors Senecal and Smith were engaged to build a new cathedral to plans by Montreal architect Jean-Omer Marchand. On August 15, 1906, Monsignor Louis-Philippe Ad\u00e9lard Langevin dedicated the cathedral, which became one of the most imposing churches in Western Canada.\n\nOn July 22, 1968, the 1906 cathedral was damaged by a fire which destroyed many of the structure's features and contents including the rose window, vestments, 1860 bells, and parish records. Only the fa\u00e7ade, sacristy, and the walls of the old church remained. In 1972, a new, smaller cathedral, designed by \u00c9tienne Gaboury and Denis Lussier, was built behind the 1906 fa\u00e7ade.The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St Boniface Cathedral.\n\n\n== Cathedral cemetery ==\nThe remains of Chief One Arrow were interred at the cemetery from his death in the 1880s until August 2007, when his body was exhumed and sent to One Arrow First Nation in Saskatchewan.\n\nOther notable people buried in the cathedral cemetery include:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nUniversity of Manitoba Interior Photograph\n\"Notre Dame brings back memories of St. Boniface Cathedral fire\", CHVN95.1FM\n\"The Red River Voyageur\", John Greenleaf Whittier",

          "very nice landmark, just accross the river from the forks, grave of louis reil is right next to it, and then within walking distance is the St. Boniface Museum, always seems to be a peacefull setting here",
          "We found this Basilica as we were walking around Winnipeg. The walls of the old church have been left intact, and are visually striking as a ruin. We were lucky enough to be in the courtyard as the bells struck 12 noon",
          "This was a bit of an eye opener as rather than trying to replicate they enhanced the ruins of the Bascillia and built a smaller modern one within the walls. It has a very interesting grave yard. In the graveyard lay the remains of the reputed founder of Manitoba Louis Riel who",
          "I lived in Winnipeg at the time of the fire that consumed the Basilica and remember it well. The old church is still stunning and the new church within the ruins has been very well done.",
          "The front wall of the church is intact but without glass and has bells on the top. The rest has basically gone but there have built a new church with a beautiful interior in the interior of the old church. A must see in the area.",
          "Short walk from downtown. Nice place to see - historic wise and a beautiful building - what is left of it.",
          "This site could have a lot more information about the French community in St. Boniface and the centuries of worship here. The old facade is hauntingly beautiful with an interesting graveyard but could step into the major leagues with some more interpretation. They could also",
          "Although I visited the cathedral and cemetery early in a summer morning, I liked the calmness and peace I felt there. Many famous people are buried there and there are several monuments and sculptures of religious or historical interest.",
          "Went here without a tour guide and walked around. Very interesting just being on the grounds. Got deserts and chocolates in the shops close. Pretty area.",
          "This Cathedral is a must-see for anyone going to Winnipeg. You'll also want to go to the St. Boniface museum, where you can get the whole story of the tragic fire that took down all but the front of this building.",
          "The Basilique-Cathedrale de Saint Boniface is quite renowned, thanks to the tomb of Louis Riel. He was buried in November 1885, A brown pillar indicates his tomb. Some think he was a hero, others thought he was a rebel. The basilica looks quite beautiful on the outside. I liked",
          "I have visited this place multiple times. It is beautiful, peaceful, and part of history. I love walking down the cemetery to the Cathedral, paying respects to Louis Riel, and going inside the Cathedral to enjoy the big structure. Whether you're religious or not, you will be",
          "One of my favorite places to go shoot photos. Gorgeous architecture with tons of history. During the late summer to fall months it is perfect for sunrise photography.",
          "Beautiful old cathedral that was burned out in a fire. The new church is behind the ruins. The Cemetery is in front and Louis Riel's grave is there. You can get great sunset shots here. In the summer they have theatre in the cemetery that is really worth seein.",
          "If you are looking for a piece of history in the old French side of town this is not to be missed. Walk the property and see the unique architecture. Bring your camera. Best to see in warmer months.",
          "St. Boniface Cathedral is an amazing structure rife with history. The 1906 cathedral was significantly damaged by fire in 1968, leaving only the facade and walls of the old church. There is something unique about this \"skeleton\" that remains. As you walk through the structure,",
          "Went here, spent about 20 minutes, left. Nice to see but wouldn't go out of my way to visit here. There are grander things to visit in Winnipeg. But if you've got the time, it's worth the go...",
          "The church has so much history ,with in it. The tiles ,the statues . You feel a sense of peace and serenity,while visiting the sanctuary. While the hostess tells you of the big fire. How the parishioners showed pride in their church. Kept coming to the masses held in the part of",
          "These are the remains of what was once a beautiful basillica! After the fire, these walls are all that remains!",
          "The walls still stand to a once beautiful church. The structure itself is still great to go and look at. They have a small church attached to the rear of the walls so you can go inside and see a mock display of what it once looked like at least it was set up in 2012 when I was",
          "The cathedral ruins are spectacular and the cathedral built within the ruins is beautiful as well. It helps to have a guide explain why the original wasn't able to be replaced (cost limits) and how the local architect designed this very modern building (along with the beautiful",
          "went with family the weekend of nuit blanche, saw the cathedral ruins change from daylite to night time. Fantastic!! Excellent lighting for walking around, paths well kept. beautiful grounds",
          "We did a quick tour of the ruins of this cathedral. The newer church was closed so we could not go inside. However, walking the cemetary and seeing the gravesite of Pres. Louis Riel was very interesting. Humorously, the cathedral has a fake owl sitting on the top. It was",
          "With a group of visitors to Winnipeg we took a quick tour of St Boniface. We stopped at the grave of Louis Riel and Lagamodiere and gave them a quick history lesson. A must see site if you are interested in Canadian history.",
          "An amazing piece of Canadian history. The architecture of this building is still amazing even though it is only the facade that remains. Wonder through the cemetry here and visit the grave of Louis Riel.",
          "Even though the services are now all in French I find it to be a beautiful place to visit. Very prayerful and peaceful!",
          "It is peaceful to walk the cemetery grounds and see the history here. Louis Riel, Metis founder of Manitoba, is buried here. I was there at noon when the bells tolled and that was a very tranquil moment on a rainy, blustery day.",
          "The grounds were spectacular and near the river. Beautiful architecture and interesting cemetery adjoined.",
          "If you liked the view of this ruined cathedral from across the river, you'll love it even more from up close. The new church is an odd juxtaposition to the remains of the front wall, but is still interesting. The walk around the cemetery leads you to many historical graves, all",
          "Not that much to see. But worth walking by. Louis Riel's burial plot is in the cemetery. A couple of benches to it and relax at",
          "Beautiful church with a cemetery serving as burial ground for prominent Winnipegers. There is a nice view of The Forks and downtown Winnipeg from the grounds.",
          "Beautiful place, beautiful location to walk by. There is a trail that the office of tourism propose which is call \"The loop\" and it's worth doing it.",
          "This is an excellent way to learn about the history of Winnipeg. What is left of the church gives you great perspective of its origins. The adjacent cemetery is also quite interesting.",
          "We loved walking in this place. I found there are a lot of mosquitos in July because we got eaten alive but we still love this place. :) Fun for kids to stretch their legs.",
          "Breathtaking ruins of a beautiful cathedral - loved the cemetery surrounding also - took a number of pictures",
          "Me and my gf traveled around winnapeg at night just to explore and were really impressed with this old church. we were the only ones there so it was kind of creepy around the graveyard but it was a really cool experience.",
          "Great place to visit and spend some time looking at the centuries old gravestone markers of Manitoba's forefathers. Beautiful scenic view from the Forks which is across the river the Provenche` Bridge and the Human Rites Musuem and Goldeye Stadium-its like taking a step back",
          "Beautiful entrance and interesting cemetary as you walk in...but the actual cathedral is a very boring new building. You wouldnt go out of your way to visit this but worth it with a trip to the museum close by.",
          "The old part of the church is beautiful I can only imagine what it looked like before but it was a great idea to put the new church inside of these old walls. Well worth your time if you like churches and their history behind them",
          "I walked across the bridge from The Forks to see what remains of the St. Boniface Cathedral which burned for the 5th time in the 1960's. I also wanted to see the lace where one of my ancestors was during the early 1900's. Unfortunately, there are no records left, but it was a",
          "Beautiful ruins and grounds as well as a very unique present day church. Take the time to visit and walk to the fiver for great views of Winnipeg.",
          "Remnants of burnt cathedral. Magnificent grounds. Historical grounds and grave yard. Buried place of Louis Riel, founder of Province. Magnificent old shade trees",
          "There isn't a lot to see at the Cathedral site, but what's there is beautiful and well worth the visit. Well-preserved ruins of the burned-down cathedral, plus the grave of Louis Riel - a very important place for Manitoba, and the only attraction of its kind for Winnipeg.",
          "Don't expect excitement here. This is a beautiful, shady, peaceful oasis in the middle of the city. It is a wonderful place to walk around, grab a seat, read, or just think. If you need some time to yourself, this place is perfect.",
          "My daughter and I toured the cathedral, neither of us had seen it before. The ruins of the original cathedral are impressive and I am sure the old facility had many secrets to be shared. The new cathedral built after the old was burned back in the '60's doesn't really do",
          "Nice facade remaining after a fire but nothing particularly exciting for me - took all of about 5 mins New cathedral was locked do couldn't get in to see it",
          "This site has a ruin of a once great Cathedral (sadly burned down accidentally in 1968) and a modern Catholic church within the ruins. It is an interesting juxtaposition of old and new.",
          "the ruins of a cathedral, a cemetery, and Louis Riel's burial site. All make for an interesting look into Canadian history. it's a very worthwhile walk from downtown. Very well kept - very informative.",
          "Breath taking structure.Under slow restoration. Gardens with historic tombstones - some toppling over. Nicely laid out grounds.",
          "We came for mostly the very old cemetery - to see the Louis Riel gravesite - but seeing the ruins was really great too. The whole area almost has a park feel, despite the fact you are surrounded by tombstones. We like cemeteries, so that was okay. Very clean ruins with lots of",
          "Wandering in and around the basilica is very peaceful, many headstones are so old that they can't be read. Nice piece of history to enjoy for an evening stroll.",
          "--if you like ruins, which I do -- this is the facade and exterior walls of a 1906 cathedral which burned in 1968, carefully cleaned up, propped up and restored. Incredibly photogenic. What is it about ruins in the midst of a modern bustling city? Intimations of our own",
          "Although the Cathedral has only the from door left, you can visit the main hall of this church after a 1 min walk from the front entrance. Not sure of those bells on the front wall are still working, but it is a really calm and comfortable place for visiting.",
          "Louis Riel's Metis leader grave on site along with other historical figures. Mary other sites and attractions in the area.",
          "Intriguing way to save the old and yet make it new. It had some of the most interesting modern stained glass I have seen in a church and easy walk from the Human Rights Museum.",
          "We visited the cathedral on the very nice sunny day . It is located next to the Forks historical site . If you walk around the river , do not miss this beautiful cathedral",
          "Lots of easy parking on the nearby streets. Across the river from the Forks. The remaining non-wood shell of a burned down cathedral. Louis Riel's grave is out front.",
          "Wonderful grounds meant for exploring historical times. Absolutely breathtaking and well maintained.",
          "If you are a history buff then be sure to stop by the old cathedrale. Despite a fire burning down the majority of the building the stone serves as a ghost of the spectacle this monument was. Let your imagination run wild of its past life.",
          "Stopped here while on a city tour. It is the burned out ruins of a catholic church that has been rebuilt. . very nice. . worth a stop",
          "St B is a beautiful part of Winnipeg, but the Basilique Cathedrale de St Boniface is hands down one of the best, if not the best, photo backdrops in the city. The architecture is breathtaking and is an iconic building for St. B.",
          "A pity that most of it is gone but still worth a visit if you are around. A walk through town is much nicer when the sun shows.",
          "This is a must stop and view. This location offers much to see including the old Saint Boniface museum, the college is just in the back and the grave of Louis Riel lies on the grounds.",
          "I found the connection between the more contempory design of the new Basilique-Catherdrale built within the remaining ruins of the 1906 Basilique-Catherdrale that burned down in 1968 is very interesting. The surrounding cemetery is a \"must see\" - Louis Riel, Ambroise L\u00e9pine,",
          "I were here on February 2016 with my father , nice place to visit near to Museum and university St.Boniface . Just across the river I went to Forks market and museum of human wrights.",
          "I visited the Saint Boniface Cathedral on the afternoon of January 23rd with my mother. The cathedral is huge and very impressive and I loved the beautifully detailed and intricate architecture from the arched doorways, to the columns, to the decorations at the peak of the",
          "I was impressed by this church and the graveyard is worth a look for it's grave of Louis Riel and the monuments to the great war.",
          "Located in St. Boniface Winnipeg, a wonderful piece of architecture to view. I think it is good for sightseers visiting Winnipeg and old St. Boniface.",
          "travel by this icon of history several times a week and in the summer walked through the cemetery with it great history.",
          "The Basilica is a nice place for a afternoon visit, very peaceful for prayer , or quiet reflection. The outside grounds are nice to walk around, the remaining facade is quite stunning, great for some pictures, casts a nice shadow and the sun coming through is very nice, you can",
          "A great piece of Winnipeg history. The new church integrates well with the old. Visit Louis Riels grave!",
          "The remains of the Basilica are a great place to visit for the history. Next door at the museum you can see photos and a video of the fire that destroyed the Basilica. it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, the new Basilica was hijacked by the modernism of the times. It cannot",
          "The Cathedral is a wonderful and peaceful place to visit and you can take many pictures to keep in your memory for whole life. Each minute spends in this place, it will be memorable.",
          "Went here to say a little prayer,i'm happy this is open during the day.Outside structure architecture is stunning.Inside the church,its modern.",
          "Lovely setting and architecture. No charge. Visual appeal is the huge fire damaged cathedral surrounded by cemetery. Inside the rebuilt church it is very peaceful",
          "Went on a walking tour of this location on a beautiful autumn afternoon. Enjoyed the story boards and historic atmosphere. Lots of people use this place for taking pictures (weddings, family portraits, etc) so one should be aware in order to avoid being in the background etc.",
          "Just outside of Louis Reil's grave - the original cathedral was mostly destroyed in a fire in the 50's. The church was re-imagined in a 60-70's style. A great place for photographs. The church itself is a balm for the soul.",
          "This building is beauiful. So happy I finally got around to seeing it. I love the history behind it.",
          "The Monastery is gorgeous. I have seen many people use this site for wedding photos and possibly the ceremony itself. Very easy walk from the Forks over Provencher bridge, and nice little trails along the river to walk along after checking it out. Very pretty, it is a must",
          "An easy walk from The Forks area, this is well worth the jaunt. The history of the area is very important to Canada, and the architecture is excellent. I've been many time (beaucoup de temps) and will go again the next trip to Winnipeg.",
          "Beautiful facade and cemetery. I said to another couple that I wished we could hear the bells. About 30 minutes later, I was able to hear them across the river.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and the architecture amazing. The graveyard grounds are beautiful an well worth including in your travels. We walked from the fort Garry Hotel so and nice stop on our walk",
          "Wonderful Cathedral! The person at the service desk was amazing and offered us advice about where to go in the city and told us about the Cathedral and it's history. Very well done! Loved it here! Come see Louis Riel's gravesite!",
          "The Cathedral and the nearby St. Boniface Museum are an integral part of this city's history. Although it succumbed to fire in the 1960s, the rebuild that is housed within the walls of the original is an architectural coup. Museum is housed in the oldest building in Winnipeg and",
          "Historical and Beautiful....if you love churches you will love this one. Although it has been refurbished since the fire in the sixties it still has a lot of it's original character and beauty !!",
          "The cathedral was built within the ruins of the orginal church destroyed by a fire. The architect was very creative and designed the building to fit within the walls of the ruins of the previous church. Very creative way to link the present with the past. A must see for",
          "This building is absolutely stunning. My boyfriend and I walked along the strip and visited many sites.",
          "I had previously seen Basilique-Cathedrale de St-Boniface from my mom\u2019s sightseeing pics. I wondered then about the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s big bare rose window and initially thought it was just ruins and nothing else. When we finally got to visit Winnipeg, our first actual look at this",
          "The remains of the Cathedrale of St. Boniface is interesting to see, but only the shell remains with a very modern chuch built attached to the shell of the old Cathedale. You can wander through the cemetery and see all the old tombstones.",
          "The St. Boniface Cathedral is very nice, it was nice to be able to see the maquet how it was before the fire. If you go inside, you will be able to learn more about the construction. The grounds is well kept and it is a nice walk. Very peacefull location.",
          "We visited the cathedral during our last full day in Winnipeg and I'm sure glad we did. The cathedral and grounds are very beautiful and there is a good view of the river from the front gate. Lot's to see, including Louis Riel's tomb. Highly recommended.",
          "Fabulous history A must to see. I walk around. Check out the cemetery. History galore. Wonderful architecture have fun",
          "We loved St. Boniface and the Cathedral is a great place to visit to see a piece of the history of the city. It is very interesting to walk through the cemetery (with a French dictionary) to get a different perspective on how rugged the territory must have been. The museum",
          "The cathedral of St. Boniface is a fantastic visit, right in the French quarter of Winnipeg. On plaques, inside, is the story of St. Boniface, which truly is a fantastic tail. The entire property including the cemetery was very interesting.",
          "Saw this our first night - it is absolutely beautiful. We were there about an hour walking the grounds and taking pictures. Wish we knew more of the history before we went. There was a mass in progress and the songs of the choir added such a feeling of peace for us. Very",
          "The building and grounds are amazing and very well kept. Very peaceful. Great place to walk around and think.",
          "This a must see. We had visited the location in the late evening which had made for some good photos. A local of the community stopped and explained me the history. Great! Peaceful and serene.",
          "I really enjoyed mass here, except I had no idea what the priest was saying. That is, of course, my fault for purposely attending a mass said in French. After mass, a very nice couple approached me and gave me advice about Winnipeg. I also met the priest. Coming here made me",
          "It is a beautiful church, the original had burned, but the most walls and front didn't burn, so they are part of a courtyard. There is a cometary next to the church that is very interesting too",
          "Check out St. Boniface and visit the Basilica! A wonderful combination of the old and the new! Walk up Provencher Boulevard and enjoy the French flavour!",
          "A must see! It is really neat to see this the building of this church and the story behind it! The people are friendly and you get a a real live history from people playing the lives of the people of Manitoba many years ago. It is not expensive and really worth seeing. Lived in",
          "This church was and will always be beautiful. It must have looked majestic before most of it burned in a massive 1968 fire. In 1972 a smaller cathedral was built in the originals ruins. It's not nearly as impressive, but I don't ever intended to be. The cathedrals cemetery",
          "If you love Canadian history and great architecture this is the place for you. Wedding pictures, outdoor theatre, Loois Riel's Statue are all within your grasp at the Basilica. Since the fire that burnt the original basilica, we have been left with the beautiful arch. This",
          "The cathedral apparently suffered a fire in the past. The solid ruins that remained they wisely left standing. Very interesting place to visit, and they have an excellent view of the river. The entrance is impressive as are some of the older tombs. Many of the city's",
          "It says a lot about the ugliness of Winnipeg that the most beautiful building in town is the shell of a Romanesque cathedral that burnt down in 1968. It also says a lot about the loss of faith in mid-century that the replacement cathedral hides in the shadow of its predecessor.",
          "If you happen to be in Saint Boniface, make sure you go to the Cathedrale. It's a nice place to take picture and the architecture is really nice.",
          "Interesting and surprising how the remnants of the old cathedral that was destroyed by fire could be used and incorporated in a very modern new cathedral. Startling to look through the old front facade where one would expect to see a stained glass window and instead, see sky.",
          "Wherever we go, there are cathedrals. I don't look forward to them, but they usually surprise me. Happened again! The original burnt down in 1968, and the masonry still stands. And looks good. But the new cathedral, built within the old one, is welcoming, warm, light,",
          "I had read about the Cathedral before I went to visit, so knew that the front portion of the Cathedral was all that was left after the fire of 1968. As you walk through the old entrance towards the new church behind it, it seemed very fitting that they left the beautiful",
          "Only the fa\u00e7ade left of what must have been a great cathedral before the interior got burned down, but it is indeed an impressive fa\u00e7ade, tall and imposing with a carving of a bishop on top. Nearby, on the foregrounds of the Cathedral is the grave site of the Metis leader Louis",
          "The cathedral remains are spectacular. It's hard to imagine this structure being erected without major heavy equipment. The walkway up to the face of it provides a contemplative walk allowing during which to scan the cemetery that surrounds the grounds. There are many famous",
          "Just down right beautiful fascia and a complete disappointment with the rebuilt church on the back of it. The grounds surrounding it and the cemetery were beautiful. Its a must see but driving by will get it done as the new church lacks any real beauty to the old church facade.",
          "Fascinating old Cathedral. First church was built in 1818 and six churches were built after that. The facade that you see today was part of the church built in 1905. It burned in 1968. The sixth church built in 1971 coexists with the historic walls of the burned church.",
          "During our passage, only the outside visit was possible. The original facades were preserved what gives beautiful attraction. On the site, there is a cemetery where Louis Riel's remains are buried.. In brief, a place to be registered on your list of things to be visited in",
          "If your into checking our churches this is a nice spot to walk to during a visit of the Forks. Just cross the very cool bridge and hang a right. Its worth the walk over and has some great photo opts. The model of the original church in the main entry area is very cool.",
          "Saw this place from across the river at the Forks and decided to walk over and have a look. Nice and beautiful place.",
          "Man, the negative reviews of this memorial Cathedral have totally missed the point. Saint Boniface has been the center and spiritual home for the French speaking and First Nation Manitobans for 200 years. The Cathedral has burned down twice and been rebuilt three times. The",
          "This is a spectacular sight if you enjoy history and architecture. All that's left is the facade from the original cathedral, which is stunning (they've built on to the back end now). The grounds are filled with old gravemarkers from the 1800s, including the graves of Riel and",
          "The graveyard and walls house historical pioneering men of Manitoba (Red River Settlement). The adjacent museum is a must see also. Come at noon and hear the peeling bells. There is nothing more impressive and historically impressive in Winnipeg than the Cathedral, Museum and",
          "Very boxy building placed in the ruins of a former great building and it didn't work. Has the feel of an auditorium not a church. Not a sanctuary but a stage. Art is very amateurish. Instead of a separate chapel for the Blessed Sacrament would you believe the tabernacle is",
          "After the Basilique burn the ruin were incorporated into the new church. It is a very interesting structure.",
          "Lovely place for a short walk. The Cathedrale is a shell, interesting as an example of prairie architecture of the 19th century, but, if one is used to European cathedrals mildly interesting.",
          "We took time out to vist the Bailique-Cathedrale de Saint Boniface because Saint Boniface came from near where we live Crediton about 6 miles from Exeter, but to be honest there was nothing to see as the Cathedral had been bombed during the war i presume. ? and there was not",
          "Interesting ruined facade in lovely garden setting with Louis Riel's grave, Different! The effect of blue sky through the open ruined rose window is quite beautiful. Modern church in the ruins a work in progress.",
          "The cathedral that would have probably been worth visiting burned down a long time ago. What's left there now is a wall from the old building and a relatively new, below average looking church. The Louis Riel burial site is in the church's cemetery.",
          "This beautiful surroundings and history of the French Quarter are a very interesting part of Manitoba's birth.",
          "We went to Saint Boniface to take a look at their museum and visit the 'French quarter' of Winnipeg. We came across the cathedral on our way to the Museum... we spent some time in the cemetery where we stumbled on Louis Riel's tomb... the remnants of the old basilique (it burnt",
          "They are just that. Ruins in front of the new cathedral which is modern. There are tours in the summer tied to the history of the area. Bridal photos take place on weekends so you have to keep your distance from them. Cemetery is worth a walk with the Louis Riel grave site",
          "We crossed the bridge from the Forks to visit the cathedral. It was a short, and pleasant walk. The cathedral was destroyed by a massive fire, due to negligence of a construction worker who smoked there. The cathedral that is working now is much smaller but is very nice.",
          "This church is a fine example of what I love about our churches. The main church was destroyed by fire many years ago and it would have been too expensive to replace it so the site was cleaned up and a smaller church was constructed within the walls of the original church. We",
          "Definitely worth a look. Love to take midnight strolls through the beautiful, historic Cathedrale.",
          "The old building which was destroyed by fire stands in front of a more modern basilica. Come to enjoy theatre in the cemetery.",
          "Take a tour. Lots of interesting historical anecdotes enliven the stone and wood structure and relics.",
          "I am from this area, attend mass regularly and love history",
          "There isn't much to do here, but it's worth it to take the time to see it, especially at dusk so that you can see the historic grave sites, but also see it all lit up once it's dark.",
          "Took a side trip to St. Boniface to see the cathedral. Was worth it. Beautiful architecture. You can also visit the grave of Louis Riel and others. History comes alive there.",
          "First visit to the Basilica and Louis Riel grave. I felt keenly aware of Red River history. The graves of some of the earliest settlers of this area were very moving.",

        "wiki": "East Kildonan is a primarily residential community in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, located in the northeast part of the city. Commonly known by its initials \"E. K.\", the suburb has a population of approximately 35,800 (2016 Census).\nEast Kildonan is bounded by the Red River on the west, the lane between Larsen and Harbison Avenues on the south, Panet Road, 100 metres (330 ft) north of Blantyre Avenue, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Marconi tracks (removed in 2006) on the east, and Oakland Avenue on the north. East Kildonan is made up of the neighbourhoods of Munroe, Morse Place, Rossmere, and Fraser's Grove.\nIt is mainly a working and middle class community, though there are poorer pockets south of Munroe Avenue and more affluent areas along the Red River and west of Henderson Highway, East Kildonan's major thoroughfare. There is a small industrial area located between Watt Street and the CPR tracks.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Kildonan\" originates from the Parish of Kildonan which was created in 1817. At the time, parishes formed both a land use system and a system of local government. The Parish of Kildonan formed part of the Red River Colony, and was named for the Strath of Kildonan on the Sutherland estate in Scotland where many of the settlers came from.The Municipality of Kildonan was established in 1876. From 1876 to 1914 the Rural Municipality of Kildonan included a large area on both sides of the Red River, just north of the original City of Winnipeg. The area remained primarily agricultural until the beginning of the 20th century. It was a centre for market gardening to serve the needs of nearby Winnipeg. In 1903 streetcar service was initiated in the area and this began the area's development as a residential suburb of Winnipeg. In 1906 the more heavily developed southern area of the municipality, known as Elmwood, joined with the City of Winnipeg.\nIn 1914 Kildonan was divided in two: East and West Kildonan, with the Red River as the boundary. Subsequently, in 1925, the areas north of Oakland Avenue separated to form the Municipality of North Kildonan. East Kildonan developed rapidly after World War II, the population grew from 8,439 in 1941 to 30,150  in 1971.\nIt was incorporated as the City of East Kildonan on July 1, 1957. Incorporation made East Kildonan into Manitoba's sixth largest city, with a population of 20,000. In 1959, the opening of the Disraeli Freeway further accelerated the growth of the area.\n\nIn 1972, East Kildonan, along with the old City of Winnipeg and eleven other municipalities in the Greater Winnipeg Area, amalgamated to form the City of Winnipeg. It was the only suburban municipality to be in favour of the \"unicity\" scheme.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiles MacDonell Collegiate - East Kildonan History\nProvince of Manitoba, Capital Region Planning Framework: A Brief Historical Perspective\nEast Kildonan Police 1914-1974 Pre-Amalgamation Police Department Histories (City of Winnipeg)",

        "wiki": "St. Boniface (or Saint-Boniface) is a city ward of Winnipeg that is the centre of much of the Franco-Manitoban community. It features such landmarks as the St. Boniface Cathedral, Boulevard Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, St. Boniface Hospital, the Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Boniface and the Royal Canadian Mint. It covers the southeast part of the city and includes le Vieux Saint-Boniface (Old St. Boniface), Norwood West, Norwood East, Windsor Park, Niakwa Park, Niakwa Place, Southdale, Southland Park, Royalwood, Sage Creek and Island Lakes, plus a large industrial area. The ward is represented by Matt Allard, a member of Winnipeg City Council, and also corresponds to the neighbourhood clusters of St. Boniface East and West. The population was 58,520 according to the Canada 2016 Census.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSucceeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years before European exploration. It was an area of historic Ojibwe occupation.\nFur traders and European mercenaries hired by Lord Selkirk to protect his fledgling Red River Colony were among the area's first European settlers. With the founding of a Roman Catholic mission in 1818, St Boniface began its role in Canadian religious, political and cultural history \u2013 as mother parish for many French settlements in Western Canada; as the birthplace of Louis Riel and fellow M\u00e9tis who struggled to obtain favourable terms for Manitoba's entry into Confederation; and as a focus of resistance to controversial 1890 legislation to alter Manitoba's school system and abolish French as an official language in the province (see Manitoba Schools Question).\nFrench-speaking religious orders, including the Sisters of Charity of Montreal (better known as the Grey Nuns), who arrived in 1844, founded the early educational, cultural and social-service institutions, such as St. Boniface Hospital, the first in Western Canada. Early French-speaking missionary Catholic priests in the region founded the Coll\u00e8ge de Saint-Boniface (dating to 1818) to teach Latin and general humanities to the local boys; it is now the Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Boniface.\nSt Boniface was incorporated as a town in 1883 and as a city in 1908. \nThe early economy was oriented to agriculture. Industrialization arrived in the early 20th century.  The 165-acre (67 ha) Union Stockyards, developed 1912\u201313, became the largest livestock exchange in Canada and a centre of the meat-packing and -processing industry. By the early 1900s, numerous light and heavy industries were established. Today the Stockyards site will be redeveloped into a housing and retail area Olexa Developments of Calgary beginning in 2020. In Phase 1 of the development, up to 600 housing units would be constructed.In the 1950s and 1960s the neighbourhoods of Windsor Park and Southdale developed into residential areas. In 2016 Windsor Park had a population of 10,050 and Southdale had a population of 6,450.In 1971, St. Boniface was amalgamated, along with several neighbouring communities, into the City of Winnipeg. As one of the larger French communities outside Qu\u00e9bec, it has often been a centre of struggles to preserve French-Canadian language and culture within Manitoba.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Festival du Voyageur is held annually in February outdoors at Whittier Park and Fort Gibraltar. St Boniface is home to the Centre culturel franco-manitobain (CCFM), which features an art gallery, theatres, meeting rooms, and a community radio station. The area is also home to Le Mus\u00e9e de Saint-Boniface Museum, a French theatre company Le Cercle Moli\u00e8re, a local museum dedicated to Franco-Manitoban culture and history.\n\n\n== Notable natives and residents ==\nLouis B\u00e9tournay \u2013 lawyer and judge\nModere \"Mud\" Bruneteau \u2013 professional hockey player\nLen Cariou \u2013 Broadway actor\nBryan Fustukian \u2013 radio disc jockey, concert promoter (as Vik Armen) and performer\nButch Goring \u2013 professional hockey player\nGeorge R.

The St. Boniface Riels were founded in 1971. They play at the Southdale Arena and have won five MMJHL championships: 1971\u20131972, 1972\u20131973, 1984\u20131985, 1985\u20131986, 2014\u20132015.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHuel, Raymond Joseph Armand.

It is the only dry-land connection between Churchill and the rest of Canada.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe northbound train leaves Winnipeg at 12:05 on Tuesdays and Sundays and is scheduled to arrive in Churchill two days later at 09:00. The southbound service departs Churchill at 19:30 on Thursday and Saturday evenings and reaches Winnipeg at 16:45 two days later. An additional weekly service operates in each direction between The Pas (departure at 02:30 on Fridays) and Churchill (departure at 19:30 on Tuesdays).\nThe service, which runs through Manitoba and Saskatchewan, travels on the Canadian National Railway line north to The Pas, where it transfers to the Hudson Bay Railway, passing through Wabowden, Manitoba, with a spur from Thicket Portage to Thompson, and Gillam on its way to the Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay, taking approximately 45 hours each way. \nAn unnamed mixed passenger train connecting with the Winnipeg\u2013Churchill train at The Pas previously served Lynn Lake, but this service was truncated to Pukatawagan in 2003 by the then track owners OmniTRAX citing a loss in freight traffic making the service unprofitable. Via still operates twice weekly service from The Pas to Pukatawagan on behalf of the Keewatin Railway which now owns the Sherridon Subdivision.Service between Gillam and Churchill was suspended on May 23, 2017, when flooding heavily damaged the track bed and bridges. Repairs of the track began on September 8, 2018. By October 31, 2018, the track was repaired, and passenger services resumed with train 693 on December 2.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Winnipeg \u2013 Churchill train at Wikimedia Commons\nWinnipeg-Churchill train at Via Rail Canada",

          "Talk about an awesome winter wonderland! It is worth the admission however, I do think that charging the same for children and adults might make it tough for some families to attend. Maybe a 10 and under rate? The night we went was pleasantly warm for this time of year so it was",
          "Hands down the best Zoo in Western \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6. Polar bear area is an excellent place to spend plenty of time. So many majestic animals to view. The ultimate place for families but awesome for a couple as well. Will be back.",
          "\u2018Tis the season and save $3 per ticket by getting your tickets at Red River Co-Op before attending the event. Once we arrived at the Zoo we had to wait outside, when the could have easily allowed us to wait in the Lobby area at the main entrance before getting to the entrance",
          "Quite a variety of animals. We love the polar bears, watching them swim from under the water tunnel is super. Monkey exhibit also fantastic as we saw a mama teaching a baby how to swing on the vines. Overall wonderful visit, definitely worth a stop driving through Winnipeg.",
          "I went to the zoo mainly for the polar bears, prior to my trip to Churchill. There are 9 polar bears, eight that were rescued orphans. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is wonderful with the polar bears having outdoor and underwater areas. Watching the polar bears swimming was",
          "What a great place to spend a few hours. Loved this place. They have a cafeteria like restaurant that has a wall of windows that view the polar bear habitat. So you can watch them romping in the snow.",
          "We had so much fun seeing all the animals and took so many pictures. I highly suggest especially if you love animals and have small children.",
          "This is a great place for family activities. The Journey to Churchill is the star of the show. You\u2019ll love the seals and if you\u2019re lucky catching the polar bears swimming in the tunnels. Highly recommend this zoo.",
          "Despite the rain nearly all of the animals were out and about. Watching the polar bears coming over the hill and then close to the viewing window was the highlight of the zoo for us Texans. Since there were few visitors, a zoo volunteer took us around to some of the exhibits",
          "Even on a cold day I enjoyed wandering around this zoo. The Polar Bears were very active. Their enclosure in the Churchill section of the zoo was large enough to house six gorgeous bears. They were enjoying themselves. What was really cool is there is zoo restaurant, with",
          "I had the pleasure of visiting the zoo in the snow but the animals I was most interested in seeing were still quite active. The Journey to Churchill exhibit was a treat. While I ate lunch there were three polar bears up next to the glass so that was a fun experience. I did",
          "The zoo was a pleasant surprise. I had not gone for several years because of massive construction and not seeing many animals when you went. They have definitely done a massive upgrade, which is reflected in the price now, but not out of line with other zoos I have been too.",
          "We absolutely enjoyed our visit to the Assiniboine Zoo! There are an incredible variety of animals, including our favorite, the Polar Bears! We also loved the indoor playground as it was a perfect break for our 2 year old before getting some lunch at the connecting cafe. 10/10",
          "The day was cool, cloudy and misting but the visit was excellent. The Polar bears gave a very good showing, tousling and playing both in the out door display area and the inside \u201cwater tunnel\u201d Could have watched them for hours. The Amur Tigers were out and roaming and relaxing.",
          "This zoo is amazing. There is staff and volunteers everywhere to answer questions and give information on the animals. The tundra restaurant has windows so you can watch polar bears while eating. The exhibits are set up so you can actually see the animals unlike some other",
          "We spent about 2 hours because we had to go, could have easily spent more. Really well done, very friendly staff along the paths, animals are well kept. Fabulous zoo!",
          "A well layed out well maintained clean zoo. There were lots of endangered species and some I had never seen before like a trip colored squirrel. The tiger was beautiful and there was a baby monkey. They seemed very content. It was off season so there was only one place to eat",
          "Family, friends or solo...this place is fun. It\u2019s a smaller zoo which makes it comfortable to visit. I found the highlights to be the polar bears and stingrays. The polar bear loved to show off his swimming abilities...I could have watched this all day. The stingrays were social",
          "Arrived early to the zoo, and got really good views of two polar bears close up in their enclosure, another one majestically swimming over us in the glass tunnel, and a fourth rolling around outside the restaurant whilst we ate lunch! Lots of other animals including snow",
          "This zoo was a decent zoo... wasn't the best, but also not the worse I went to. The Stingray exhibit was worth a star all by itself. A few cages were empty and there were no monkeys which was a disappointment",
          "A really nice mod-sized zoo, we spent the morning walking around and were surprised to see how active all the animals were. Some of our favorites were the wolves and the polar bears. Not many people when we went so there was little crowds and you could watch the animals at your",
          "Many of the animals here are from cold climates and are very active during the winter months. The Polar Bear building and Tropical house offer great places to warm up for a little while if it is windy outside.",
          "Was a lovely way to spend a fall afternoon. Much improved. Well mapped, clean, shuttle service if needed.",
          "Presently surprised and it fantastic we will be going back as tons to do their. Its at least a half day to do it all and then some. Great way to spend time on a nice day",
          "I would go like monthly if I lived closer. Such an amazing place with many amazing things to see. I recommend this to everyone. Great for all.",
          "Must see when you are in Winnipeg. Spend the $30 to rent a scooter if you want to see everything in one day. We spent 3.5 hours there and the wife and I both had a scooter. Can't imagine how long it would of taken if we walked it. A lot of back tracking and miles of trails.",
          "First thing I must say: we did see the polar bears so that rates very high. We saw three of them; one was playing and would jump into the water on to a floating toy. The other two were laying right against the glass so we had an perfect view of how majestic they are. The zoo",
          "The zoo was a lot of fun. John and Val running the team were pleasant and informative. Had a good time at the butterfly exhibit. Stopped to have a bite after petting the sting rays. The food was good and 100% beef with no fillers. Everyone was friendly.",
          "Disappointed that there was not one bear to be seen. Obviously that is the main attraction and a big factor for the high cost to get in. The grounds are not as well maintained as they were many years ago. Won\u2019t be going again. Nothing really to attract us now after the",
          "From out of town? Plan for 4 hours. Lots of walking. It\u2019s decent and worthwhile I think but not world class. Expensive for a family, watch website for reduced admission days which sometimes include free kids admission. Parking is free. Polar bears are enjoyable if they are",
          "We enjoyed it and saw several polar bear exhibits as well as a wolf feeding. The polar bears are all rescues from Churchill.",
          "Great activity for walking and viewing animals in close to natural habitats. If walking is an issue, scooters, strollers, etc. are available for rent and there is a free tram that does loops throughout the zoo. Bob, the tram driver, was excellent and gave a very good commentary",
          "It was nice to visit the zoo for the first time again after long years. Have heard of friends and family that their experience was lousy because the bears did't show up, but when we visited the zoo, oh it was truly fun! Me and my wife enjoyed the close encounter with the bears,",
          "What a great zoo for young and old alike. The enclosures are spacious and provide excellent space for the animals as well as excellent view of the animals for the zoo patrons. Love the polar bears!",
          "We always go to this Zoo while visiting family who live in Winnipeg. It is beautifully kept. The highlight was when the polar bears were in the water above us playing. We had our lunch in the restaurant. We spent about 6 hours in the zoo. Would highly recommend a visit",
          "I think the highlight for us was the polar bears swimming around us when we walked through glass tunnel. The guide was very informative.",
          "Specificially went to see the polar bears and they did not disappoint. They swam and played in the water and there is an underground view place, so you could watch them. We had a guide and she was extremely knowledgeable.",
          "You could not ask for better. Wonderful exhibits, free parking ,reasonable adnission,lots of benches for resting and lots of bathrooms. Alot most of your day to see it all.enjoy the polar bears and the monkeys.",
          "This was our first zoo visit since our children were small. Nevertheless it was vry memorable because of the chance to get real close to a couple of rare animals. The first was a white bison. We were told it was not an albino. The other experience was with polar bears. My wife",
          "No trip to the Peg should be without a trip to the zoo. It\u2019s big enough that there\u2019s space for large animals and groups. The specialty is on North American and particularly arctic/subarctic species. The polar bear conservation exhibit is excellent and there\u2019s a swimming area",
          "As with most zoos the animals don't look happy in cramped spaces, they are seen pacing up and down, buffalos in small acreages with hardly a blade of grass. Zoos should be based on breeding programs for endangered species. I felt very sorry for the big cats in their cages and",
          "We really enjoyed the zoo. Highlights were the polar bears and the arctic fox. Lots of educational information about polar bear conservation for the children. Seals were fun too. A great family day out.",
          "Visited the Assiniboine Park Zoo this week. I was most impressed! You can be driven around the zoo like a hop on/ off bus. Visited the stingray exhibit. Very interesting creatures. Watched a feeding time. So informative! Visited the butterfly garden. So many beautifully coloured",
          "It was probably the hottest day of the year but when we visit Winnipeg, we go to the Zoo and have since it was free many years ago. Now it's almost $20 per adult, but that's where it should be. It's easy to walk around the zoo, not like the Toronto Zoo that is sooooo big! And",
          "The park is beautiful. There more than just polar bears! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Beautiful and serene place.",
          "The Assiniboine Park Zoo has become such an amazing place to view animals. My daughter and I are here at least twice a month. With the addition of the Journey to Churchill a few years back, the polar bear population has increased tenfold. Now they have the Stingray Beach which",
          "On 2 weeks holiday in winnipeg really poor because of the distance to see the animals but it's a shame because living in the UK I was looking forward to see different animals. Never saw any tigers only a glimpse of polor bears Shame.",
          "Allowed 2 hours as suggested. It was a very warm day and we found a lot of the animals we hoped to see were off somewhere cooling themselves. Understandably but disappointing for us. Had hoped to see polar bears but sadly didnt. However did pat a stingray! Plenty of areas to",
          "My daughter and I spent the morning here and were mainly interested in seeing the red pandas and the polar bears. We stopped by the red pandas first and fell head over heels in love. It was feeding time and they were just so cute. The caretaker was gentle with them but did not",
          "We lucked out and got to see two polar play flighting in water for an extended period of time... so we saw claws and teeth. We learned a ton about the species and how humans and global warming is effecting their habitat. So amazing to see Bisons too!",
          "On July 9, 2019, our whole family from Arkansas enjoyed a visit to Winnipeg and visited the Assiniboine Park Zoo to see the Polar Bears and other Northern animals. We had a relaxing fun morning and saw lots of the animals, including swimming polar bears, seals, tiger, ocelot,",
          "Yesterday we went to the Winnipeg Zoo. It was warm but we saw the most of the animals. The zoo was big and you have to walk a good distance to see all the animals. Therebis a small train that can give you a tour. The ice bear part was fun. It was huge so they can walk freely.",
          "We went on a hot summer day specifically to see the polar bears but unfortunately did not see them. We were told the best time for viewing is in February. The exhibit area is impressive and we did get to see some seals swimming. Walked around the other animal enclosures but",
          "It was super hot but still had a great time. Didn't get to see some animals as they were hiding in the shade. can't wait to go Again. Highly recommended.",
          "Great place to visit with your family. Animals well cared for and plenty of volunteers on hand that are very knowledgeable and answer any questions you may have.The interaction tables about the zoo for children (and adults) to learn extra facts are great.",
          "The zoo is a place you don\u2019t want t9 miss. We have journey to Churchill with the polar bears, there really is a lot to see and there are animals to interact with as well.",
          "When my friend wanted to go to the zoo for her birthday outing I was like great I love the newer Polar Bear exhibit and there are stingrays this year. When they said they wanted to go for 4 hours I have to admit I thought they were nuts! Well prove my sorry beep wrong.",
          "The animal compounds are very expansive. The animals seem very happy. The journey to Churchill was what drew me to this zoo. I had contemplated going to Churchill to see polar bears but this time of year is not guaranteed. Plus the expense of getting there either by plane or",
          "Although I remain somewhat uncomfortable with the whole idea of zoos, this place is both a meaningful connection to my childhood and a whole new place with so many improvements. The polar bears are breathtaking and being able to watch them swim from underneath is really worth",
          "Came down to my old stomping ground in St. James to get a milkshake and walk around the park\u2019s grounds. The sculpture garden is a must, but just sitting down by the river, strolling over the bridge and into the trees against a sunset backdrop is a true prairie wonder. Few things",
          "The polar bears swimming in their tunnel is my very favourite part of the zoo. I could stay and watch these amazing bears all day, but then we move on to other great things to see.",
          "The food was fantastic here! Saw the snow leopards, polar bears, seals and so forth. Was worth the journey.",
          "This zoo has come a long way over the years. Don't let the price deter you, as there's much to do and see here, and they are doing amazing work with the polar bear conservation. They are open year round as well!",
          "Liked the animals mostly because many were unfamiliar to me. Coming from the African safari world, gives me a different perspective. Seeing the Elk at close range was awesome and the polar bear was incredible.......the peacock though refused to show us its beauty.",
          "My love for animals goes way beyond measure and this zoo provides me with all the animals I could think of plus more. The layout is beautiful and the scenery even more so. One of the best zoos in my opinion in Canada!",
          "Had a lovely stroll through the Zoo and checked out the Stingray exhibit... then we had lunch and watched the polar bears at the Tundra Grill... family friendly place to visit... also enjoyed a few moments in the Gift Shop;-)...",
          "The animals are well taken care of here. I love the wolves, snow fox, snow panthers, and of course polar bears! You can have a very close look at the polar bears. But I think some indoor facilities need improvement, the smell is too strong for visitors, and I wonder if that\u2019s",
          "Took a notion to check out the Zoo- hadn't been there since before the construction of the polar bear facility. Had a great time, weather was cool but sunny, and the animals were out in force. We ambled around the whole facility. Really noticed how well put together that",
          "Went on a rainy day and that is probably the most animals I have ever seen in one visit, pretty much all the animals except the red foxes and lynx were out, that\u2019s a pretty good success rate. Because of the weather, very few people were there at the same time, which made it much",
          "Not a big zoo but plenty to see - we are from overseas so maybe some of the animals wouldn't be that exciting for Canadians but great for us - bison etc. The highlight was the polar bear area - we were lucky enough to have a beautiful polar bear playing with a bucket for a",
          "Went with 3 older kids and we all really enjoyed it! Prices were reasonable and food was good too! Would go again!",
          "Don\u2019t waste your time. Go to calgary you might see something... hardly any animals to see, extremely dissapointed.",
          "This was a great zoo a lot of fun and the kids had a blast. Absolutely worth the visit. You could spend all day or half the day here.",
          "one of my fav places to visit every time I go to this city. it is a lovely zoo, clean, well kept and friendly staff !! just adore it and well worth the time spent there .",
          "The Journey to Churchill was amazing - watching the polar bears play with their toys captivating. I appreciated the Conservatory's vision to make the polar bears habitant both fun and educational.",
          "Plan to spend an afternoon and you will not be sorry. Watching the polar bears and seals swim was worth the very reasonable price of admission.",
          "This is a good zoo for families with a good selection of animals. The polar bears and seals were interesting. Mid size park so you are not exhausted.",
          "$20.50 per person. That's what it cost to see 2 horses take a crap, a baby monkey and 5 different species of goat. If any of these things excite you, then this is the zoo for you! If you'd like to see any animals that typically aren't on a farm, this zoo has slim variety. I went",
          "We went on a cold wintry Monday and there was only 15 or so cars in the parking lot. We virtually had the zoo to ourselves. What a treat! We enjoyed seeing some of Canada's iconic animals like the Snowy Owl, the Arctic Fox, and wolves. All were easy to see, despite generous",
          "A great place to visit whether you want to see the beautiful zoo or just enjoy the huge acreage to relax., Catch a concert, or visit on Canada Day. Easy to get to lots of parking and spend the whole day with a little picnic/BBQ lunch",
          "The Assisiboine Zoo has a large variety of animal exhibits. Our favourite is the Polar Bear exhibit where you can walk through a tunnel beside their swimming pond and often see a polar bear swimming close to the glass. There is also an interesting timber wolf site clise by the",
          "We decided to visit this zoo on a whim when leaving Winnipeg, and I'm so glad we did. The enclosures are well made and had a ton of room, and the animals looked so happy. Most were out as it was only around -6 degrees, and they were all playing, eating or laying in the sun. The",
          "It's February, the middle of winter in Winnipeg and we decided to visit the Assiniboine Park Conservatory (primary to view the seven Polar Bears). We were surprised how many interesting animals where on display weathering the elements as well. Camels, a Bengal Tiger, eagle,",
          "A great way to spend the day with the family or a friend.The zoo has many attractions and exhibits from butterflies to buffalo and is always upgrading its facilities. Family pass is the best value for the dollar and especially with little ones up to teens.",
          "We spent the day at the zoo on a very cold day. When we arrived at the polar bear exhibit, we didn\u2019t want to leave. It\u2019s worth the price of admission.",
          "We didn't get a reserved area as they were all booked. Had lots of fun. I'll admit the new entrance still throws off my orientation when I'm in there. The kids really enjoyed the butterflies",
          "This zoo is all about 1 thing....the Polar bears. They have a massive enclosure for the bears to roam around. You are able to see them in the underwater viewing tunnel and if you are lucky you will see several bears swimming, fighting, and enjoying their time in the water",
          "The zoo is a wonderful place to bring your family. I loved when they had the dinosaur exhibit. ( this last year was giant bugs ~ I liked dinosaurs better ) I found the zoo to be very clean and well managed. the animals looked healthy. I especially love the newest edition to the",
          "I specifically went to the Assiniboine Zoo to see the exhibit entitled: Journey to Churchill. Churchill, in Manitoba, is where the polar bears and beluga whales come in Hudson\u2019s Bay, Canada. It is a very expensive trip up to Churchill, Manitoba and I was hoping this zoo",
          "We went there with family, it's so much fun. You get to see polar bears, underwater aquarium and so may animald. But the food part was a little disappointing as we could only get chips and nachos and that too for 3 times the original price. Could have been better. But Overall",
          "We have twin 13 year olds, a 10 year old, and a 3 year old. We have bought a family membership now for two years and it is totally worth it! Even when we are short on funds, it's nice to just go hang out on a kid date because of the membership. Well worth it.",
          "The polar bears were active and looked very content in their habitat. We were able to see them from inside the Churchill coffee shop as well as from outside. The cub conservation area was lovely. Three volunteers stopped us to talk so that they could recommend which animals",
          "Went there with wife and daughter. The biggest attraction here is the polar bear exhibit. It is very well built and seeing polar bears in real is amazing. We even got to see them swim over us (we were in underground tunnel with glass above us). Unfortunately lions were sleeping",
          "I\u2019d grown up going to the zoo and although it was enjoyable, often the animals were lazy and sleeping trying to escape the summer heat. I\u2019d never brought my own children to the zoo and thought it would be a fun activity over the winter break on a warm January day. Plus kids 12",
          "We went in the winter and had a wonderful time! Several volunteers always in reach, sre happy to help with questions and additional information. Prices are very reasonable. The zoo, and in particular the polar bear area, are wonderfully designed and huge (which obviously",

          "Wonderful venue set in beautiful grounds did not feel like a Zoo as I am not in favour of them, however they rescue polar cubs who have been orphaned and there are some adult ones too who were brought there as young ones. Lovely viewing platform in restaurant so you can sit for",

          "We enjoyed our visit here very much. As the weather was cooler, the animals were more active and were playing with the pumpkins they had been given by the staff. The Tundra Grill has large windows to watch the Polar Bears who come right up to them. This was one one the nicest",
          "Visited the zoo with a young friend of mine from India. He really enjoyed the zoo and the great expanses of land in many enclosures. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is impressive by any standards. The enclosures for the wolves and bison allow a visitor to observe the animals",

          "We\u2019re big fans of zoos. If you can look through our reviews you\u2019ll see a lot of Zoo visits. So believe me when I say Assiniboine Zoo\u2019s polar bear exhibit is one of the best bear exhibit I\u2019ve seen and it totally worth the price of admission. They\u2019ve got a tunnel where a bear can",

          "Great place for a family day out. Although a little cool out today there are lots of indoor attractions to see and warm up in. The Journey to Churchill exhibit was wonderful. One polar bear was swimming in the glass tunnel. Very amusing. He gave us quite a show. The seals are",
          "We were excited to visit a zoo with animals from the north since we live very far south. Were disappointed not to see the polar bears swimming but glad to get to see a polar bear. Loved watching the seals swim. Got to see so many animals we had never seen before. Lunch was",
          "This is a great zoo for kids and adults alike. With the Journey, to Churchill exhibit, world class, we take all our visiting friends to see the Polar Bear Sanctuary. The other animals are great but the bears and seals steal the show. The butterfly tent in the summer is",

          "While we were surprised at the cost of admission ($35.50) for 2 of us, we enjoyed the layout of the zoo and the variety of animals. It was mid-week in September, and the tram wasn't running, so if the tram is important to you, check ahead. Also the ice cream shop was closed, but",

          "Polar Bears! The Journey to Churchill was the greatest zoo exhibit I've ever seen in my life. You are literally beneath full grown polar bears looking up at them only a few feet away. WOW! We were in Winnipeg for a total of 14 hours and we spent two of them at the Journey to",
          "This Park has a wide variety of wild animals. Giraffes, polar bears, black bears monkeys, various wild bird species, etc.",
          "Great place to take the family especially kids. Friendly staff and great map. Be prepared to walk although you can take the complimentary trolley bus. You just have to wait for it. The polar bears and tigers were the highlight. But remember most animals sleep during the day so",
          "This is a great zoo to see the animals. Each exhibit is clean and the animals seem well looked after. There were very few animals we were unable to see because of the design of the enclosures. The layout of the zoo is very easy to follow and see all the animals.",
          "It is a well laid out zoo and flows well. We really enjoyed watching the polar bears playing from the underwater observation area. Definitely one of the highlights of our visit. There were some wonderful knowledgable people at different areas teaching interesting and fun facts",

          "Always a spectacular way to spend a few hours. Make sure your first stop is the Polar Bears - you want to see them swimming in the WATER, otherwise you will only see them curled up sleeping if at all. If the Polar bears are not in the water ask a Zoo Employee what time the Polar",
          "We had a great visit! Kids loved walking into the Kangaroo enclosure and through the butterflies. The extreme bugs made both the 6 and 3 year old jump. Lunch in \u201cChurchill\u201d was special as a polar bear cane up close to he window!! Took a tram ride too, driver was extremely",
          "The Zoo was interesting and had a uniqueness all it's own. I'd recommend making the Zoo a must see on your visit to Winnipeg. Of course since you are there you have to take the trolley and make the rounds in the Assiniboine Park you won't be disappointed.",
          "I have not been to the zoo in many years. It certainly has changed and was a wonderful experience. It is well layed out and marked. Loved the polar bears, snow leopards and the butterfly exhibit.",
          "I\u2019m not a big fan of zoos, but the winnipeg one had a few very interesting things to offer. One for sure is the butterfly area, what was very nice with lots of plants and of course ... butterflies! The other one was the journey to churchill what was very interesting and of",
          "During our recent trip to Winnipeg, we spent a day at the Assiniboine Park Zoo. While it isn't the largest Zoo that we've visited, it definitely has charm. The polar bear exhibit is an absolute must see.",

          "We visited on a rather hot day but that was our choice in timing, some animals were seeking the shade. We spent 3 hrs and still didn't see it all as we hit closing time. Polar Bears are the highlight, the New stables for large horses is beautiful. We definitely will return",
          "Took our grandchildren to the zoo! They were looking forward to the dinosaurs! (A special exhibit that was on last time we took them. Unfortunately that was not there this time - but the polar bear experience was awesome!!! One jumped into the water while we were in the glass",

          "We went to the zoo on a hot summer's day in July. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the animals were either inside or hiding in the shade. A lot of the exhibits appeared to be empty, which was obviously disappointing for us. The zoo seemed relatively small compared to some of the",

          "The location of this zoo is great. Easily accessible by auto or bus. Exceptional layout. Maximized viewing of ,most enclosures. Numerous rest areas. More shaded areas would be welcomed. We have been to numerous zoos in North America as well as Puerto Rico, Cuba, and British",
          "A WONDERFUL zoo experience! Having a polar bear swim above you while walking trough a clear tunnel? What? AMAZING!! We went early in the morning on a cloudy day with light rain showers. The animals were up and active due to the cooler weather. It was AWESOME!!!! The zoo is",
          "Visiting a zoo with my daughters 9 and 4, I really don't expect a lot. But I do expect to see animals. Many in this zoo were either missing entirely, or nearly impossible to see because of the design of the exhibit. Not all exhibits were like this. Some were very good. But they",
          "Just a wonderful day with the family at this big, exciting, clean, fun zoo. Had a great time seeing so many animals, pandas and seals were big hit, 360 movie great, and all the staff so friendly. Do yourself a favor and get some mini donuts while you are there!!",
          "Family & child friendly. The staff are knowledgeable of the animals there. It was very welcoming. It\u2019s recommended to go early to find a good parking spot. I think \ud83e\udd14 it should be priced under $20, though.",
          "Overall great outlay, easy to navigate, comfortable to walk around, good variety of animals. Gift shop prices not too rediculous, restaurant prices ok too.",
          "First visit in years, the new improvements are excellent. Love the larger enclosures. First visit to see the polar exhibit, really enjoyed it. The seals were highly entertaining.",
          "We took our friends from the UK to see the polar bear at the zoo. The compound that the polar bear are housed is quite an amazing and natural environment. They delighted everyone with constant antics and we all came away stunned by their beauty! However, as we continued to",
          "We hadn't been here since 2010 so we thought we would come see the new exhibits. The polar bears were really cool to watch swimming around over top of you in the glass enclosure. Seals were neat too. Enjoyed watching the polar bears out the window of the restaurant while we ate",
          "Visited with my husband and two year old daughter... we loved the Polar bear area where they also had a short film in the theatre which was interesting enough to keep our toddler entertained. Lovely zoo to walk and explore... horse cart rides too which we didn't do as our",
          "Great place to see, lots of variety of animals, nice walking trails, plenty of food and washrooms. Free tram around zoo, a/c spots thru out if a break is needed. Polar bear and red panda are a real hit!",
          "So the zoo has done some Reno\u2019s, added and changed a few things. I\u2019d say that things look better and the new attractions are cool BUT....still have a tough time finding my way around, unsure if I saw everything or if I missed something cause there isn\u2019t a whole lot of direction.",
          "What a perfect visit to the zoo. So nice to see the pens are large and designed so visitors can view the animals without fences in most areas blocking the views. The Polar Bear area was huge and so like the bears proper habitat. Be sure to visit the Butterfly enclosure that is",

          "I haven\u2019t been to the zoo in many years! It is bigger and better than ever. Love the new polar bear exhibit! The new bugs part sucks - they are animatronics - not actual live bugs. I appreciated drink vending machines located throughout the park. It was hot out today!! This",
          "This is my second time here (1st time 2 years ago) and it was just as enjoyable. There were new polar bears swimming but just as active and cute. It was a hot day so while lots of the animals were hiding or just sleeping the bears kept everyone entertained. The butterfly area",
          "This was one of our reasons for visiting Winnipeg and we were not disappointed. So many animals to see and very clean. The map was helpful, but I would recommend a lot more signage to help people navigate this very large zoo. The polar bear exhibit was incredible. It alone was",
          "The Zoo has had many positive upgrades since I last visited many years ago. The Polar Bear exhibit is well worth the price of admission especially if you are lucky enough to see them swimming in the pool over your head.",
          "I hadn\u2019t been to the zoo in a long time and I hardly recognized it. I remember as a kid when the zoo was FREE. Now it\u2019s $20 (kids are less) and I actually felt like I got my money\u2019s worth. The polar bears alone are worth it. Very cool. No pun intended. Overall I was really",
          "Beautiful zoo, we loved watching the polar bears swimming !! The zoo is well maintained, the facilities are nice and the animals seems comfortable. The only downside...it's way too expensive... 55$ for 2 adults and a 4 y.o... Anyway we had a good time !!",
          "Great zoo - lots of different animals. Loved how spacious the enclosures seemed for the animals (especially compared to some other zoos). Easy to see the animals as most enclosures went 360 degrees around. The polar bears and meerkats were a hit! Thanks to the volunteers who",
          "This is a spacious place for visitors and the permanent residents! We were impressed by the amount of space most (but not all, e.g. the charming red pandas) of the animals were given. The high point was observing a polar bear swimming. You can observe every movement through",
          "This is the highlight of the Assiniboine Park Zoo. Seven years ago when we first visited the zoo there\u2019s only 1 lonely polar bear in the inclusion. This time we\u2019ve seen 6! Amazing!!! We were kind of disappointed at first when the one and only polar bear looking into the tunnel",
          "The zoo is a must visit if you are visiting winnipeg. It is reasonably priced as well. Our first time was a bit more exciting than the second, the newer attractions take a while to open so you do not get to see anything new or exciting if you go more than once. the dinosaur",
          "The Churchill area is the main attraction and worth the visit by itself. Do not miss the rest. They devote the same effort to the other sections. White Buffalo stand out.",
          "Spent a windy afternoon walking around this smaller zoo. Our big interest were the polar bears of which they apparently have 6 or 7. We walked the whole perimeter of the polar bear exhibit to no avail. Finally asked a staff member of which there were few and got directed",
          "The new zoo is way better than the old boring hoofed animal collection but is still not worth the high price. There should be a couple if days a week with cheap or free admission for kids. $60 for a family of 4 is just too much. Making it affordable will increase revenue with",
          "We all enjoyed the monkeys and lemurs the polar bear was cool that zoo was well planned out and we walked all the animal areas enjoyed ourselves immensely. Absolutely recommended.",
          "The zoo is always a must everyone we're in Winnipeg. Great exercise and there's always volunteers roaming around to offer some very interesting info about the animals and the conservation efforts. The polar bear exhibit is absolutely wonderful!",
          "We didn't tour the whole zoo but attended a wedding reception held @ the polar bear exhibit, it was AMAZING! Definitely worth checking out while in Winnipeg.",

          "While our zoo may not be \"world class\" they certainly do everything possible to attract visitors. The animatronic dinosaurs were wonderful and this year, while I have yet to see them, they have giant animatronic insects. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is wonderful and it",
          "Visited Winnipeg for the first time with my whole family. We have 3 kids, ages 10, 6 & 4 and we were hoping they will enjoy going to the zoo since there is not much to visit in Winnipeg. We didn't see lots of animals walking around the zoo. We saw a polar bear and it was",
          "I\u2019ve been to quite a few zoos and this one is the least favorite. I felt bad for the polar bears: they looked so parched, in the sun during a hot day. There was geese poop everywhere you walk - I know they can\u2019t help that, but I wish they had a way to clean it up. Don\u2019t wear",
          "This is fabulous, be sure to go in the morning as that is when the bears are most active. You can watch them swim from a few feet away. I never get tired of seeing them!",
          "I am usually not a zoo person but I am glad with how much space the animals have there to roam around. Pretty cool animals and got to see a lot! Great place for people of all ages :) Went with my sisters, mom and my sisters boyfriend (all over the age of 26)",
          "We let our family membership expire this year. When the renovations to the zoo began, we had great expectations. The polar bear exhibit was exceptional and we were waiting for more improvements that would reflect the equally exceptional fee hike for tickets and memberships. That",
          "The Assiniboine Zoo was not what we thought it would be so, therefore, it was a disappointment. There has been a lot of hype that the zoo was revamped with many new exhibits, but all that seems to be done is the installation of fake rocks. We arrived early to see the many",

          "It\u2019s a small zoo, easy to travel around. Lots of things to see, of course. Best part is the Churchill Exhibit, with the arctic animals.

          "The zoo is changed a great deal since I first visited it over 40 years ago. The most exciting aspect of this zoo is the Polar Bear exhibit. Not to be missed. All the many other exhibits are in mostly great shape and a visit to the Winnipeg Zoo was highly recommended.",
          "Disappointing . Polar bears (2 seen) were letharhic . No brown bears . Wolf enclosure being rebuilt. Only a few small monkeys, few birds.. there were a few wild cats and various cattle . did not see any penguins . Basically not worth the trip. Did not seem much to hold",
          "Very nice. I don't always like zoos but the animals here had plenty of space and appeared happy and stimulated.",

          "When we went it was still a litter cold so walking outside was chilly. The journey to church hill was the best exhibit . The polar bears were so fun to watch them playing above you in the underwater tunnel.",
          "The new additions and expansion are amazing! You can really get up close and personal with the bears and seals, the viewing tunnel where they swim is amazing. A lot different from when I was a kid. I miss Debbie, the old polar bear that lived at the zoo for many years. But what",

          "Great place to spend a day with family and friends. Lots to do and see for all ages. It\u2019s in transition however so somethings are not always open to the visitor. It\u2019s greatest asset is the free Assiniboine Park right next door. Amazing beauty for free. Especially the Leo Mol",

          "We love the zoo in winter! The animals are much more active and there are fewer people! We visited recently on one of the rare mild days and it was a great zoo day. The cougars put on a real show by chasing each other and a big orange ball all over the enclosure. And of course",

          "A variety of animals leaving in a well preserved environment where you can see them behind the glass or a fence, playing together or just relaxing. Do not miss to stop by the aquarium to play with the seals by holding any piece of clothing with your hand and make circles and see",
          "The Assiniboine Zoo was a lovely place to spend a few hours on a summer day. There's a lot of walking involved but it is very logically laid out and if you follow the path, you'll be sure to see everything. The polar bear exhibit is really nice with a tube that you walk",
          "What a nice and enjoyable place. Lots of animals, excellent condition of the park, I will go back yo see the polar bears on winter time.",
          "We took our 8 month old to this zoo as her first outing of this type of magnitude. It was just the right size that there was enough to listen to and look at that she didn't get bored fussy. The cafeteria about half way through had applesauce and cheese strings for purchase",
          "take any visitor to our zoo and you'll realize how lucky we are to have it. It is not the biggest Zoo in Canada but possibly the best. The Trip to Churchill is so well thought out",

          "Amazing zoo! Entrance is $19.00 for adult but the best value is membership; standard annual membership cost is only $69.00 for the whole year, [I believe it's only closed Christmas Day], and the paths are groomed daily in the winter - great way to enjoy the outdoors in every",
          "This was the first time back at the Zoo for me since all the upgrades. The polar bear exhibit is exceptional...very cool to see them swimming from below. Had a lovely hour & a half walk around on a beautiful Wednesday morning in early September. Added bonus was \"Wild",

          "I have been here 4 times in the past couple of years while visiting from the U.S. As a long time Wpg resident there is no comparison from the \"old\" zoo to the present. I was fortunate on this trip to take in the dinosaur exhibit and butterfly exhibit which I'd never seen before",
          "Go for the Polar Bears but everything else is in need of an update. The Polar Bear exhibit has been very well done but the entrance fee is not worth the Polar Bear experience.",
          "Interesting and diverse animal exhibits, polar bears, fun dinosaur exhibit. A full day for the kids.",
          "The only reason why I gave the zoo a very good is because some of the enclosures were too small and had no water features. The dinosaur exhibit was excellent. The zoo is part of a lovely park and was a nice way to spend the afternoon. The volunteers at the zoo were fantastic",

          "While visiting family in Winnipeg I decided to plan a tour of the Zoo and see the work that has been done to enhance and upgrade the displays. As a senior, I asked for a seniors entry fee and was asked if I was also a grandparent - yes, 6 times over and was given a 50% discount",
          "The Assiniboine Park and zoo make a lovely setting for a family or couples outing. There is so much to do and see. The zoo is getting better and better with more animal friendly environments. The park is lovely and offers paths through forested areas, lovely gardens, ponds,",

          "Summer 2017 saw a fabulous Dinosaur exhibit at the zoo. Large dinosaurs with moving parts and sound effects were thrilling for kids. Personally I love the butterfly garden and wish I could just sit and have coffee in there. Have a personal dilemna with caged animals so its is",

          "This Zoo is the place to go. The animals are incredible. The cougars, Tigers, Polar Bears, and all others. Don't be afraid to talk to the volunteers as they have a wealth of information to give. They know the names, and special information about each animal there.",
          "Polar bears, a amazing experience. Swim right over your heads in a enclosed tunnel. Many animals, birds and a pleasant restaurant with reasonable prices. Butterfly enclosure, with plants - another wonder experience! A great zoo to visit.",
          "Visited zoo after not having been here for at least 10 years. Was pleasantly surprised at the work they have put into it. Its very nicely done! The polar bear exhibit was soectacular! The dinosaur display was really neat as well. Kids will love it as they walk by the dinosaurs",
          "Took our granddaughter. Go early and when it is cooler, animals sleep or hide when too hot. Polar bear exhibit was truly amazing - so well laid out and very interactive. Dinosaurs alive exhibit was there when we were there and the movements and sounds were amazing.",

          "We visited the Zoo today. It was their September sale - adults $12. Great price. Animals were out, partridges were walking around, one even with 3 babies. Lots to see. Loved the dinosaurs alive exhibit. Nite that not all food vendors are open through the week, only",

          "A group of seven of us visited the zoo with kids aged 2-15! All of us had a great time. Weather was quite hot so animals were quieter. Lady attending the snow leopards recommended coming in the winter as the animals love the cool temperatures. The polar bear exhibit was the best",
          "This zoo is very large. Walking shoes are a must and if visiting during the very hot summer season make sure to bring sunscreen to re apply often! The zoo is so large we were not able to see everything but what we did see was amazing! We especially enjoyed the polar bears and",
          "Brought my grandson to the zoo to see the polar bears, nothing to see! It was overall a disappointing experience, all of the animals seemed to be in hiding. The dinosaur exhibit saved the day. Way too costly for what we saw!",

          "It was exciting to see the Mechanical Prehistoric Dinosaurs, The Journey to Churchill, the Polar Bears and the beautiful flowers and butterflies in the Butterflies House along with all the animals. We had lunch at the Tundra Grill and went to the two gift shops, Wild Things",
          "To properly visit the Zoo takes about four hours, The tiges are great in their 10,000 sq. foot enclosure while watching the full-sized dinosaurs move and roar is a great experience. It's a thrill to walk under the polar bears and seals cavort overhead in theit class lined pool.",
          "This zoo offers an interesting variety of animals in a good simulation of their natural environment, from Bison to Polar Bears to Tigers. The displays are also very informative and it appears that the animals are treated very well. No reason to feel guilty about seeing them in",

          "Our Assiniboine Park Zoo is another Winnipeg Treasure. It's hard to explain to visitors the many wonderful sites to see. One of my favourites is the Polar Bear exhibit as to be able to walk through the glass alley & have them swimming over top, around & playing, wrestling, is a",
          "The standout exhibit at the Assiniboine Park Zoo is the Journey to Churchill, which houses polar bears, seals and wolves in a fantastic exhibit space. A glass tunnel brings you under the water for a close encounter with polar bears and seals, but it also integrates the nature of",

          "We headed to the zoo with our 3 year old neice. Admission was around $50.00. We went early in the day and it was not a hot day. The biggest thing we found is that you really don't see many animals out, and the one's that are are far away, or hidden. What happened to the",
          "If it's a really hot day don't expect to see a lot of animals out and about. Best go on a cooler cloudy day. Get there fairly early in the morning to see the polar bears playing in the huge walk through tube. Quite amazing! The grounds are beautiful, butterfly house is awesome!",
          "Not as nice as it use to be. Sure polar bear Churchill exhibit is nice. Haven't seen bears in water or roaming around yet. The gibbon exhibit did have a gibbon. Only one..lemurs not as many as before. Monkeys-not as many.Zebras-gone. Prairie dog exhibit-only the wild ones",
          "A good zoo. Solid overall experience and the polar bear area and current dinosaur exhibit is worth the trip. Not quite equal to Toronto but we'll worth the drive and money if your in Winnipeg",

          "Being a local, I had been at the zoo many many times when my children were young. As they grew older, my visits to the zoo declined. I was very happy to learn of all the wonderful additions and renovations over the past few years and had every intention of visiting, but I never",
          "Beautiful zoo with lots to see. It was a very hot afternoon when we were there, so many animals were not very active. We were disappointed that we didn't see any of the polar bears or cubs. You can easily spend three hours or more here.",

          "The Journey to Churchill exhibit is nice but if you want to see anything other than polar bears, you'll be disappointed. This zoo doesn't even have giraffes or lions and most of the exhibits are overgrown weeds with no animals in them. Defiantly not worth the $20 admission fee.",
          "It's been a year since we've been here, and it's as great as ever. The zoo staff and volunteers are friendly and helpful, and you can see they work very hard to take top care of these animals. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is the star of course, but to see a white bison is",

          "It had been several years since going to the zoo as I now live in BC. They have really spent some money and added several new attractions. Laid out nicely where all attractions just combine together. Polar bear and seal house were are favorite. Nice way to spend a couple hours.",
          "Went to see the zoo after several decades. The polar bear swimming tank is impressive, and you walk through a glass tunnel and they swim around you. The wolves were also gorgeous. A rare white bison is an impressive member of the local herd. Many of the habitats are very kind to",

          "Not the best Zoo I've seen. The Polar Bears could not be seen on the day I went to the Zoo. It was very disappointing. It wasn't cheap either. It was a bit of a disappointment to be honest. The monkey cages were nothing like they used to be. There were very few monkeys -",
          "Easy to either walk or take the tram around the grounds to see the animals and attractions. Great photo opportunities and the Road to Churchill, Polar Bear attraction itself made the visit worth while. The only disappointment for us was the the butterfly conservatory was out",
          "We are regulars at the zoo! It is 100% worth the membership! We pack snacks and get lunch at the restaurant (really well priced). I have 2 kids under 2. Parking is always good, I find the best part of the zoo is the staff. They are always directing u to something exciting",
          "This was a gramma & grandpa with a 6-year-old grandson visit! We all loved the polar bears and all the other animals, but his real favourite was the helicopter that he got to climb into and pretend to fly. Gramps and I thought the dinosaurs were pretty cool, but grandson was too",

          "The Winnipeg Zoo has recently received many updgrades. The Journey to Churchill exhibit is truely unique to Manitoba and as a tourist in the town, it is a must see! $20 to get in for an adult is cheaper than most zoo's i have visited however, the quality of this zoo lives up to",
          "A zoo is a zoo, right? Well, it looks like Assiniboine Park Zoo is doing their best to differentiate themselves from the that old school of thought. Granted, there are still some of the traditional exhibit styles for some of the animals, but APC has made some fantastic upgrades",

          "A little pricey for portions being closed off. Beautiful day and a beautiful walk. Many helpful and knowledgeable staff on hand for queries and information. The zoo is unfortunately (for us) undergoing a lot of work - a good thing for the future - but left a lot to be desired",
          "Had heard much about the zoo and its Journey to Churchill exhibit. Sadly, a lot of that was closed. Some of the animals (like the snow leopard) were in tiny enclosures. We were there on a rainy day in May, so it was very quiet.",
          "We went with our grandchildren, ages 3 and 6 and enjoyed absolutely everything there. Saw the polar bears and seals...what an awesome place. To be able to experience their underwater habitat is unreal! Had a picnic, saw the snow leopards, cougar, wolves...hadn't been to the zoo",
          "Was just there today with out of town visitors. The polar bear display is wonderful - watched 2 cubs frolic and play in the water from the underground viewing chamber. I know we aren't supposed to support zoos ... and I agree totally with ones where animals are kept in bad",

          "This is a perfect attraction for children, and a nice one for adults too. Everything is well organised and the staff are eager to help. In fact, they set up mobile interpretation kiosks here and there to provide more detailed information about the exhibits, which you don't often",
          "The polar bears and seals are awesome. They have really good environments to watch them in and you can go under the glass tank and see them swimming around. The butterflies are totally cool too. Last summer my son and I saw a butterfly hatch from its pupa and it was awesome.",

          "This is a great zoo with well kept enclosures where you can tell they love their animals. A particularly nice feature of this zoo was it's lack of, shall I say, aroma.. Even visiting on a hot summer day, not once was there a dirty area where animals were kept. A very good value",

          "In November 2015 I went to Churchill to see the polar bears live so this time in Winnipeg I wanted to visit the zoo to see them. Especially as 2 of them were from Churchill. We were very lucky as we actually saw the bears playing in the pool and had a great time watching them",

The actual video was very slow and drawn out while teaching very little that could not be learnt elsewhere.",

        "wiki": "Winnipeg ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America.\nThe city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2016, Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500. Being far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F).Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWinnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as \"The Forks\". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.Sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the M\u00e9tis because of sharing a traditional culture.\n\nLord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M\u00e9tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.In 1869\u201370, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of M\u00e9tis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. M\u00e9tis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1900\u2013present) ===\nBy 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.\n\nMore than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled \"Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise\" (commonly known as the \"Golden Boy\"). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nIn the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan \"unicity\" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011, in each of these floods, the Red River Floodway was used to safely protect the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWinnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of 464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around \u221216.4 \u00b0C (2.5 \u00b0F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in). Temperatures occasionally drop below \u221240.0 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F). The actual air temperature drops below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) on average 12.6 days annually and rises above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) 13.3 days of the year. On average there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average. With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city in Canada. Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over 51 centimetres (20 in). Thunderstorms are very common during summer, and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. Low wind chill values are a common occurrence in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as \u221257 \u00b0C (\u221270.6 \u00b0F) and on average there are twelve days of the year that can reach a wind chill below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F).The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was 42.2 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily low temperature was 28.3 \u00b0C (82.9 \u00b0F) on 12 July 1936. The apparent heat can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity, and on 25 July 2007 a humidex reading of 47.3 \u00b0C (117.1 \u00b0F) was measured.The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe winters. The last spring frost is on average around 23 May, whilst the first fall frost is on 22 September.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThere are officially 236 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg. Downtown Winnipeg, the city's financial heart and economic core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street. It covers about 1 square mile (2.6 km2) and is the city's fastest growing high-income neighbourhood. More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges. The past few decades have seen the downtown undergo major revitalization efforts; since 1999, over C$1.2 billion has been invested.Downtown Winnipeg's Exchange District is named after the area's original grain exchange, which operated from 1880 to 1913. The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures, Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square. Other major downtown areas are The Forks, Central Park, Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown. Many of Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway.Residential neighbourhoods surround the downtown in all directions; expansion is greatest to the south and west, although several areas remain underdeveloped. The city's largest park, Assiniboine Park, houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Other large city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park. The city's major commercial areas are Polo Park, Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan), Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre, Osborne Village, and the Corydon strip.

As of 2016, Winnipeg districts are represented by 17 members of the Progressive Conservative Party, 10 by the New Democratic Party (NDP), and 2 by the Liberal Party.\n\nIn federal politics, as of 2015 Winnipeg is represented by eight Members of Parliament: seven Liberals and one New Democrat. There are six Senators representing Manitoba in Ottawa: three Liberals, two Conservatives, and one Independent.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, Winnipeg was the \"murder capital\" of Canada, with the highest per-capita rate of homicides; it fell to second place in 2012, behind Thunder Bay. Winnipeg has had the highest violent crime index since 2009. The robbery rate in 2012 was between 250.1 and 272.9. Despite high overall violent crime rates, crime in Winnipeg is mostly concentrated in the inner city, which makes up only 19% of the population but was the site of 86.4% of the city's shootings, 66.5% of the robberies, 63.3% of the homicides and 59.5% of the sexual assaults in 2012.From the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, Winnipeg had a significant auto-theft problem, with the rate peaking at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents in 2006 compared to 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents for Canada as a whole. To combat auto theft, Manitoba Public Insurance established financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition immobilizers in their vehicles, and now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install immobilizers. The auto-theft rate has been on a constant drop since 2006. Other types of property crime have also decreased, but rates are still fairly high.Winnipeg is protected by the Winnipeg Police Service, which in 2012 had 1,442 police officers. In November 2013, the national police union reviewed the Winnipeg Police Force and found high average response times for several categories of calls.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nWinnipeg has seven school divisions: Winnipeg School Division, St. James-Assiniboia School Division, Pembina Trails School Division, Seven Oaks School Division, Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine, River East Transcona School Division, and Louis Riel School Division. Winnipeg also has several religious and secular private schools.The University of Manitoba is the largest university in Manitoba. It was founded in 1877, making it Western Canada's first university. In a typical year, the university has 24,500 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students. Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Boniface is the city's only French-language university. The University of Winnipeg received its charter in 1967. Until 2007, it was an undergraduate institution that offered some joint graduate studies programs; it now offers independent graduate programs. The Canadian Mennonite University is a private Mennonite undergraduate university established in 1999.Winnipeg also has two independent colleges: Red River College and Booth University College. Red River College offers diploma, certificate, and apprenticeship programs and, starting in 2009, began offering some degree programs. Booth University College is a private Christian Salvation Army university college established in 1982. It offers mostly arts and seminary training.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nWinnipeg has had public transit since 1882, starting with horse-drawn streetcars. They were replaced by electric trolley cars. The trolley cars ran from 1892 to 1955, supplemented by motor buses after 1918, and electric trolleybuses from 1938 to 1970. Winnipeg Transit now runs diesel buses on its routes.\n\nWinnipeg is a railway hub and is served by Via Rail at Union Station for passenger rail, and Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba, and the Central Manitoba Railway for freight rail. It is the only major city between Vancouver and Thunder Bay with direct US connections by rail.Winnipeg is the largest and best connected city within Manitoba, and has highways leading in all directions from the city. To the south, Winnipeg is connected to the United States via Provincial Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75) (a continuation of I-29 and US 75, known as Pembina Highway or Route 42 within Winnipeg). The highway runs 107 km (66 mi) to Emerson, Manitoba, and is the busiest Canada\u2013United States border crossing on the Prairies. The four-lane Perimeter Highway, built in 1969, serves as a Ring Road, with at-grade intersections and a few interchanges. It allows travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway to bypass the city. A recent study cited dangerous intersections and low efficiency as its primary shortfalls. The Trans-Canada Highway runs east to west through the city (city route), or circles around the city on the Perimeter Highway (beltway). Some of the city's major arterial roads include Route 80 (Waverley St.), Route 155 (McGillivray Blvd), Route 165 (Bishop Grandin Blvd.), Route 17 (Chief Peguis Trail), and Route 90 (Brookside Blvd., Oak Point Hwy., King Edward St., Century St., Kenaston Blvd.).\n\nThe Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport completed a $585-million redevelopment in October 2011. The development brought a new terminal, a four-level parking facility, and other infrastructure improvements. Winnipeg Bus Terminal, at Winnipeg International Airport, offers domestic and international service by Greyhound Canada, Grey Goose Bus Lines, Winnipeg Shuttle Service and Brandon Air Shuttle. Approximately 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land to the north and west of the airport has been designated as an inland port, CentrePort Canada, and is Canada's first Foreign Trade Zone. It is a private sector initiative to develop the infrastructure for Manitoba's trucking, air, rail and sea industries. In 2009, construction began on a $212-million four-lane freeway to connect CentrePort with the Perimeter Highway. Named CentrePort Canada Way, it opened in November 2013.Several taxi companies serve Winnipeg, the largest being Unicity, Duffy's Taxi and Spring Taxi. Fifty percent of Winnipeg residents use a taxi at least once during the year. Ride sharing was legalized in March 2018 and several services including TappCar and Cowboy Taxi operate in Winnipeg. Cycling is popular in Winnipeg, and there are many bicycle trails and lanes around the city. Winnipeg holds an annual Bike-to-Work Day and Cyclovia, and bicycle commuters may be seen year-round, even in the winter. Active living infrastructure in Winnipeg encourages bicycling through the inclusion of bike lanes and sharrows.\n\n\n=== Medical centres and hospitals ===\n\nWinnipeg's major hospitals include Health Sciences Centre, Concordia Hospital, Deer Lodge Centre, Grace Hospital, Misericordia Health Centre, Riverview Health Centre, Saint Boniface General Hospital, Seven Oaks General Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, and The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg.The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is one of only a handful of biosafety level 4 microbiology laboratories in the world. The NML houses laboratories of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease collocated in the same facility. Research facilities are also operated through hospitals and private biotechnology companies in the city.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nWater and sewage services are provided by the city. The city draws its water via an aqueduct from Shoal Lake, treating and fluoridating it at the Deacon Reservoir just outside the city prior to pumping it into the Winnipeg system. The city's system has over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) of underground water mains, which are subject to breakage during extreme weather conditions.Electricity and natural gas are provided by Manitoba Hydro, a provincial crown corporation headquartered in the city; it uses primarily hydroelectric power. The primary telecommunications carrier is MTS, although other corporations offer telephone, cellular, television and internet services.\nWinnipeg contracts out several services to private companies, including garbage and recycling collection and street plowing and snow removal. This practice represents a significant budget expenditure and is more expansive than in comparable communities. The services have faced numerous complaints from residents in 2013\u201314 about missed service.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\n \nCanadian Forces Base Winnipeg, co-located at the airport, is home to many flight operations support divisions and several training schools. It is also the headquarters of 1 Canadian Air Division and the Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Region, as well as the home base of 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces. The Wing comprises three squadrons and six schools; it also provides support to the Central Flying School. Excluding the three levels of government, 17 Wing is the fourth largest employer in the city. The Wing supports 113 units, stretching from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan\u2013Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel to the high Arctic. 17 Wing also acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter-bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.There are two squadrons based in the city. The 402 \"City of Winnipeg\" Squadron flies the Canadian-designed and produced de Havilland CT-142 Dash 8 navigation trainer. The 435 \"Chinthe\" Transport and Rescue Squadron flies the Lockheed CC-130 Hercules in airlift search and rescue roles. In addition, 435 Squadron is the only Royal Canadian Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct tactical air-to-air refueling of fighter aircraft.For many years, Winnipeg was the home of the Second Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Initially, the battalion was based at the Fort Osborne Barracks, now the location of the Rady Jewish Community Centre. They eventually moved to the Kapyong Barracks between River Heights and Tuxedo. Since 2004, the battalion has operated out of CFB Shilo near Brandon.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n Media related to Winnipeg at Wikimedia Commons\n Winnipeg travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "Like the decaying, dwindling trains that it commemorates (only two trans-Canada trains per week!), this is a rather sad place. Many of the exhibits need refreshing. Still, if you remember the glory days of train travel in Canada and elsewhere, it is a good place to travel down",

          "We visited the Winnipeg Railway Museum today, May 28. It was difficult for my dad to get up the stairs as they do not have an elevator but the Museum is excellent for old and young alike. They have such a variety of things to see and do that it would be excellent for toddlers",
          "Went through the museum on a cool April day. Place is basically outdoors, so pick a warm day for more enjoyment. Some interesting exhibits, but unless you are a real railway buff, not super exciting. Have to rate no more than a 6 out of 10 overall.",
          "The Railway Museum was something my boyfriend and I quickly decided to do. It had a cheap entry fee, $5 CAD, which was great but reflected the atmosphere of the museum. We visited in April and although it was a sunny day, the museum itself was very cold. There was a number of",

          "I would recommend this a place to stop for those who enjoy train travel or trains in general. The price was $5. a person which was reasonable. Little pricey gift shop but you pay for what you get or want. Metered parking at the side of the building I was hoping for free parking",
          "Wow! What an experience! To enter into the past, and see where so many people waited for their trains that brought them to and from a new life in Western Canada. The building was built by the same Architects that created Grand Central Station in New York ( Warren and Wetmore)",

          "Located in Winnipeg Via Rail Station at the forks, is a place where you can step back in time to when the railways we're still a prime mover in this country. They have vintage rail cars, the Countess of Dufferin locomotive various displays and even an ho rail setup that is being",
          "It was snowing outside and they had the windows open - it was freezing. You have to be a real railway buff to fully appreciate this museum but there is something for everyone. The wartime role of women in the railway was an eye opener and the Canadian Pacific travel posters",
          "Major railways haven't donated much to this museum in recent years. The museum relies on admission and donations. The museum has some unique pieces of equipment. A lot of the items in the museum have been fixed and cleaned to preserve them. A lot of the av equipment needs",
          "The kids will love, and grandpa will re-tell all his stories during your tour of the rail museum. Located on tracks one and two of Winnipeg Main and Broadway Via Rail station, what once was the embarkation point for East-West travel across the country. From the ticket lobby up a",

          "This is one of those museums that you want to visit once, but probably not again for a number of years. There were a lot of informative things to see, including photos, charts, and various trains and train cars and other vehicles on display. But it was clear that it is a low",
          "While it wasn't quite what I hoped for, The Winnipeg Railway Museum was an excellent diversion for my tastes. I was hoping for more model railroad exhibits. And there were a couple, one under heavy construction, the actual Museum is the the real thing. Actual Engines and cars",

          "We have been coming to Tinkertown yearly with our kids since our oldest was 3 (she is now 12). I love that there are new improvements each year. My kids love the bigger rides and still ask to go every summer. I have to give a shout out to Management. We employ young",
          "Great little amusement park for the little ones. I dont recommend older than 8 as rides are small and designed for the younger ones. Nice place to visit though - great for small grandchildren",
          "Great place! Took my 4.5 year old niece there and we had lots of fun. Decently priced for all you can ride wristbands.",
          "We had a great time here today. We have a 5 and a 2 year old and they both could go on a lot of rides. Neither of them felt like they were missing out. The prices are actually very reasonable for food and merchandise. A great place to go with little kids!",
          "Wow what an amazing amusement park. Me, my wife and 3.5 years old daughter had a blast in this park. There was something for every age group. We took the all day pass which is highly recommended and our favs were the train ride, toddler car ride, twister and the boat ride for",
          "Tinkertown never disappoints. The kids love the rides and the food. The price is affordable. The location isn't great.",
          "Went with a 3yr old whose main interest was riding the tinker train. Free parking and entry. Worth getting the bracelet. Washrooms were ok but people had made a big mess in them. Prices are not cheap but doable. Lots of bday parties going on. Many family\u2019s had a wagon to pull",
          "Decent prices and overall a good day out with the family. Some of the rides are a bit dated, but they're still super fun for the kids.",
          "We had a birthday party for my granddaughter at Tinkertown. The prices were very reasonable. We took our own cake and bought hot dogs and drinks there. You can take all of your own food, if you prefer. They have picnic areas throughout the whole amusement park. It's clean,",
          "If you have kids and they like rides.. go to TINKERTOWN! Its great!! I especially love the train ride that goes around the park ( We always did that right before we left as child. ) The park is clean, and the food is what you would expect but still good. I highly recommend",
          "This is an annual event for us and the family. We had been going for about 6 years now and I like how they allow you outside food so that you are not stuck with unhealthy options.",
          "a small children amusement park with fun for the whole family located very close to the perimiter highway",
          "A fairly large amusement park with rides for all ages. Small, slow ro moderate rides work for the youngest of children and larger rides, some very fast work for older kids and adults. Prices are reasonable at $18 for all you can ride per person, so there is little excuse for",
          "Had a good day out with kids aged 6 & 3. Not sure if the wristband was worth it as an adult. Mini golf helped with that cost. It was unclear how many tickets each ride cost when we arrived. Being from Alberta, we\u2019ve been to Callaway Park many times. By comparison, the staff at",
          "We took our out of town Grandchildren for a fun day. The rides are good and the lineups moves fairly quickly. However, the food is expensive and not very hot. We arrived at the beginning of their day yet the french fries were not very warm and nor was the hot dog. We did mention",
          "A great little place to bring the younger kids. Lots of rides and the train ride was fun as well. The rv park close to it tho isn\u2019t the greatest place. Front office staff at rv park can be very rude and condescending.",
          "Great place to entertain kids. All-you-can-ride bracket is a good deal! (Most bang for your buck). The concession stands are cash only so come prepared. The older section has lots of shaded areas. There are rides for older kids as well. Not too far outside the city.",
          "Rides are well maintained and a good variety for kids of all ages. Staff courteous and trained to ensure safety for the kids.",
          "Great place to spend the day with the family. Rides for children of all ages...including adults. Lots of shaded areas to rest for those not riding or between rides. Great food stands as well. Only disappointment is children who don't exit ride properly and get back into line,",
          "A good day to spend with the children going on the rides and having quality time with them.Food prices a bit high though. Bring a picnic and get an ice cream and sunscreen.",
          "A fun place for your kids. Lots of rides. Close to the city for visitors and a campground beside it.",
          "Great for children under 12. Mostly younger. Food is expensive so bring your own for a picnic. One price to get in and then ride all day. Seems a bit expensive so once in summer is all we can afford",
          "We went here to have the last outdoor activities of kids before winter. They enjoyed so much especially the rides. I would recommend this place to my friends.",
          "We were staying real close by at the campground so went here one afternoon. It isn't huge, but very reasonably priced and enough to do for an 8 and 12 year old for a few hours. Fairly clean and not too bad with lineups etc.",
          "the rides aren't scary or fast but you'll have a blast anyway. specifically designed for children and they'll have a ton of fun. probably 13 and under. the parents will enjoy too.",
          "This has been around I think since my daughter was a little girl and she is now 44. We would pack a picnic for the kids and off we would go as I thought that the Red River EX was way too dangerous for our two children and that this was much more enjoyable for our babies. They",
          "Excellent place to take kids for the day. Great price for all day riding if you want. Can't really go many places with kids where they have this much fun for that cheap price!",
          "KIDS!! This is THE place for your mom & dad to relive thier childhood memories and now have a great excuse to enjoy it again because they have YOU!!! Love this place. You will too! So good! So great! So wonderful! So what are you waiting for?!",
          "This is a great place to take your kids and there is a wide variety of rides, play areas for most kids and adults. The price is worth it if you purchase the all rides access band for $18.00 each. Would recommend for families especially under 13 years.",
          "This park was highly recommended by several parents we know, and we enjoyed it a lot. The park was quite busy, but we really had no significant lineups or waiting. Thought the prices were quite reasonable.",
          "Excellent excellent family place to visit Kids will love it Been going here for 30 plus years Good parking Excellent value Food is normally priced Right beside water park and near a campground Would highly recommend taking kids here.",
          "We went as a large family group and had a wonderful time. We had all ages and we all found things to do. Lines were short and they had a new swing ride for bigger kids/adults. There is free parking/entry so only the people that are going on the rides need to pay. You are also",
          "We had visited here several times and the rides were indeed fun. However, management refused to validate an expired Groupon that we had purchased. We just didn't have time to go during that period. We were very surprised and disappointed about how inflexible they were. They",
          "Free to enter, rides are inexpensive, property is well maintained and has lots of shade and picnic areas, a really great day with the kids can be had here",
          "This park is geared for families with children up to the age of 10-12. Our three children loved it every time we went. Prices are reasonable and there is lots of parking.",
          "Tinkertown is a well-maintained and reasonably-priced amusement park for young children. I went there as a child and we bring our children 2-3 times per year. It is always a great day!",
          "This is a must for young children. It has been a blast everytime I have been here, I hope it never goes away.",
          "Found this just off the highway during our family road trip. The prices are pretty good. Each ride is one ticket if you don't want to go the wrist band route. There is quite a lot to do: rides, playgrounds and bouncey pads and mini golf. Our only disappointment was that our",
          "Great summertime amusement park for children and adults. There is a nice variety of rides, some just for children and others for children and adults. The mini train travels along the outskirts of the amusement park so you can see all of the rides and vendors within the park.",
          "This is a really fun place for kids! They never want to leave. Get a wristband and they can ride as many times as they like on any ride.",
          "Great place to take the kids ...its always packed ....they lots of rides for the kids there - go early or you wont find parking thats forsure ..... took my nephew there he didnt want to go home! so fun on the outskirts of the city not far 10 mins ....i thought it was really cool",
          "Fun for kids, it's alright priced in comparison to the fair that comes to town. On the last year they have made some location changes of rides and I think added one or two but most of the ride equipment is dated. All of the rides were open and available, with no closed rides.",
          "Highly recommended - check it out for sure! You get more than what you pay for at this location. They have a train ride that goes all the way around.",
          "Found this venue limited in menu options- mostly fast food, expensive and not a lot of healthy options. Policy that disallows external food and beverages to be brought onsite is not family friendly at all and makes an already expensive day that much more costly. Not sure how",
          "Great entertainment for the kids! A lot of variety of rides for the kids and parents/grandparents. Makes for a happy day. Have a picnic at one of the picnic tables. Makes for a fun day!",
          "Perfect for the 12 and under age group. No long lines, clean and well run. Good variety of rides that both kids and parents can enjoy ridding together. You can enjoy their fair foods or bring you own picnic, lots of tables if you decide to bring your own meals or snacks. Not an",
          "I took my two nephews, (ages 6 and 8) to Tinkertown for the day. They loved the rides and didn't want to leave. The souvenir shops are quite expensive and the fast food times are a bit expensive. The rides are wonderful for little ones.",
          "We decided to go and spend the day at Tinkertown last summer and everyone, including us had a blast!!! Lots of rides for the wee little ones and the bigger kids. There was room for Grandma too!!!",
          "It would not be too much of an exaggeration to claim that, at one time or another, a sizable portion of Winnipeg's children have gone for a day's fun at Tinkertown. Located South-East of Winnipeg minutes from the City, this long-established children's amusement park has thrilled",
          "we have gome to this park 3 years in a row for my grandsons birthday and all his little guests had a great time on the rides and in the park area for lunch very clean and just a nice place to go they have food available if you want and also it,s not too far out of town",
          "Tinkertown looms large in our kids' imaginations. It's near to our place, thankfully, so we don't have far to go to enjoy an all-day wristband of activities suitable for our youngsters. It's a nicely-landscaped family fun location.",
          "Great for younger kids. But tends to get busy with daycare kids so right at opening time. Slows around supper time .",
          "A Winnipeg tradition! Tinkertown may show it's age at times, but it always provides a fun and inexpensive day of fun for young families.",
          "Good time had with grandkids age 7 and 5. Nice family experience. Can get hot on a summer day , could use some more shade.",
          "Good spot for young family to spend day. Wide variety of rides for most childrens ages....places to grab a bite and if you like you can picnic as well. Not overly polished, but clean, friendly family spot in summer.",
          "Fantastic for younger kids 10 and under. My kids who were older than 10 tired of the rides quickly. Could benefit for more rides aimed at the tween age group.",
          "If you have small children this is the place to go. They will have the time f their lives.There's a train that goes around the park and this thing seems to draw the to it.",
          "My children and I visit Tinkertown once or twice every summer. We have also had birthday parties there no four different occasions, mostly recently in July 2016. There are lots of rides, lots of picnic tables, lots of bathrooms, and it's a lot of fun for kids of all ages. The",
          "Do your research ahead of time for height restrictions, otherwise you may end up with a disappointed kid. Ride prices were great, wristband is the best deal by far. Free admission, picnics are allowed, free parking. Hours are somewhat limited, especially in the summer it would",
          "It was always fun to bring my little sister here as a kid. There are rides for children probably up to age 5. I'm not sure what the pricing looks like but if your kids are over 5, don't bother. It's not Disney World.",
          "I went with my daughter with 5 of my grandkids whose ages were 5, 7, 14 and 15. They all had an awesome time.....lots of rides for all ages. The wristband for all day was only $17.00 per child. We had lunch there too and the prices were surprisingly reasonable! Overall A",
          "Labour day long weekend, nice and full park, but it's spaced far enough apart that people don't really get in the way of each other. The advantages of this amusement park are that if you don't use your tickets that day, they're good for another visit, and even the next year. The",
          "I've been coming to tinkertown since I was small. Now with children of my own it brings back good memories while making new ones!!!",
          "I love Tinkertown for nostalgic reasons. I remember being 4 years old and going with my family. I went on the ferris wheel with my big sisters and cried the entire time. Now that I have a family, I am so happy to be able to bring them there. My kids are still quite young, so",
          "Our grandkids, ages 8, 6 and 5 all had so much fun here. All the rides are geared for small children, with some having height restrictions. There is a large variety of things to do. The grounds are clean, as are the large washrooms. There is a concession stand with lots of",
          "Wouldn't it be great to be a kid again some days? They see things through such rose coloured glasses and everything is so amazing. My kids love tinkertown and beg me to go annually. I'm not quite sure what the huge draw is, it's the same older rides every time. But for one visit",
          "Busy day. Need lots of energy. The kids loved it. I would recommend it for young families. Our girls are 8 and 9. Probably too big for most of the rides next year. They have enjoyed this fun park in the past. Close to Fun Mountain. Both parks are on Murdock Road in Winnipeg",
          "Water park right next door Plan a two event day. Wear loose shorts On hot days prepare to take breaks to cool down. Try the lemonade. Excellent price for what you receive.",
          "Well I took my children there in the early 1980's and it was great then. Now I take my grandchildren. It is still great and brings back memories. There are more rides and the kids love it. There is a variety of food and snack items to choose from. You will not be",
          "Yes the place may have seen better days, but everything works and is maintained. The staff are really friendly. For 17$ your child gets to ride as many times as they want on the rides. This geared to kids so older teens would probably get bored as they dont have the really",
          "This is a great place for kids of all ages. Lots of rides and food is ok. Parking is not bad and the place has been around forever.",
          "Two granddaughters, two grandmothers. Kids loved the rides. Grandmothers loved the variety of the rides. $20.00 per child and they can ride on any ride, as often as they wish. Good value for your money. We finished the day with the four of us taking the train around the park.",
          "This is one of the best deals out there all day unlimited rides $17.50 for kids an adult need not pay as the rides are geared for kids and if you have a youngster to short they might be in a good mood and let the parent ride for free. I clicked free as you do not need to pay to",
          "Our family wanted to find a fun place that would be good for a 13-year old and 5-year old and not too many things popped up except the Tinkertown Family Fun Park. This affordable and well-run operation was a delight. The kids bought wristbands @$17 for the day and used them to",
          "this park needs updates!!!! most of the rides look like they will cut you open, the cars all make odd noises, and my daughter got a cut on her arm from the door. she also got a cut from the seat area. they need to possibly update or remove some rides. also they need to add more",
          "My children, grandchildren and I enjoy this family fun park. Regardless of the various ages involved, there is something for everyone - with varying levels of thrills to be experienced. The food in the concessions is great, the gift shop is nice and the game booths are",
          "Needs better straps on rides for the kids. More food stands. My son could stand up in one of the rides and we had to get them to stop the ride to take our son off. Otherwise the food stands were bare minimum.",
          "This is a super fun place if you have little ones. You can spend the whole day here. Kids will love it.",
          "This is a fun amusement park for young children; you can purchase a bracelet which is good for the whole day and allows the child to go on all the rides that they are big enough to be on and for as many times as they like. It is not a crazy big park so you don't get exhausted",
          "My toddler had a blast. He was too short for a few rides, but there were still ample rides for him to go on. His favorite was the bumper cars. However, he was quite small to be sitting on his own, next to an adult. He needed to sit on our laps, for fear he would get",
          "This grandma is a hit with the grand girls when Tinkertown is on the schedule! If the kids like rides, it's well worth the money to purchase the wrist tickets which provide unlimited rides for the visit. Spend the day, and check out every ride! There's something for everyone.",
          "We have been going here since the 1980's. A consistent family friendly user experience with rides geared toward younger kids.",
          "Ive been going off and on since my kids were little and now with my grandson, it's a wonderful place for kids and I find it's gotten better over the years.",
          "Great for families with young kids. We took the kids and their cousins this year and they absolutely loved it. Oldest being 8 youngest being 3. And if you are like pickles you should make sure to get one here they are huge and always so good!!",
          "good for kids fun time here but long waiting time. summer will come often wish it can open late for the summer",
          "Great family fun, From dawn to dusk. ride the roller coaster or the bumper cars but don't miss the train that goes round",
          "We have gone many times and the kids love it. There are a few areas with shade to sit but lots of wide open park so bring sunscreen. Staff are pretty good as well.",
          "always a classic family outing. the kids love the rides, price is ok... better if you find one of their coupons, which are everywhere. the train is always fun!!",
          "We took my brother and his family to Tinker Town. He wanted to go there with the grand kids as he remembered going when we were young and wanted them to experience the same things we did growing up in Winnipeg. Need more areas for parents waiting for the kids that is shaded",
          "We started going to Tinkertown, in 1977, when our two daughters were quite young. Now, we take the grandchildren. This is a lovely amusement park, geared for children. Its very clean, and has been owned by the same family, since it opened. Many high-school and university",
          "This was our first trip to Tinkertown, we took our 4 year old and 2 year old. It was well worth the traveling. We had a fantastic day, there are plenty of rides for both ages to go on. The prices are very reasonable, the food is good, the washrooms were relatively clean and the",
          "Second year back with my sister and her two kids. There is a ride for all kids to enjoy and even for the adults. For a fun afternoon with kids this place is worth checking out next summer.",
          "I used to take my kids here, we have great memories of this place. Train is so cute, excellent \"fair\" for little ones.",
          "This place has become a yearly summer tradition. My children love it! The staff are always friendly and the food isn't outragiously priced.",
          "Took our 4 year old grandchild to this park. He is old enough to go on a lot of the rides by himself. Went during the week so the line ups were not bad at all. It has definately gotten bigger and better from when we took our kids!. Lots of rides for kids until about the age of",
          "Great fun for families...lots of rides and great food...! Families can spend the entire day there...all you need is the weather to particitate !!",
          "We took our 4 year old daughter and she loved it! But as we like to scope for places to bring our nephews and nieces who are a bit older, I would not recommend TInkertown for them. There are very few rides for the older children to enjoy and they may get bored fast. We do love",
          "this was a great time with our extended family, All kids aged under 5 years old loved it. They have fascinating rides the kids can relate with; airplanes, fish, the car track, the train around the park. overall, expect a good time!",
          "Tinker town is a great place to take the children ! Lots of shade, picnic tables to sit & bring your food ! They do say the food is good though if you buy it there Teenagers working the rides are polite & seem to be well trained. Great place for families Line ups were",
          "We took our 5 year old grandchild and we had so much fun. He loved going on the rides and there were rides we went on with him, like the roller coaster. They have so many fun rides the kids can go on by themselves. It was 2 hours of pure fun and pleasure for the three of us. A",
          "Spent a day here this past weekend and it was a good time. Lots of great rides for the kids and some that are even fun for adults, too! I forgot that I get dizzy easily and went on the Paratrooper and immediately regretted it but it was still a blast! I thought there were",
          "Visited Tinkertown with our 3 year old. He had a blast, lots of rides for little ones. Played a round of mini golf as well which was included in the $17 ride all day pass. Lines weren't too long (went on a Thursday afternoon). Good value, we will certainly go back.",
          "Very friendly, clean and fun for little ones. Recommended!! Buy the wristband and save. Can spend the day and pack a lunch. Parents don't have to pay to watch.",
          "We attended Tinkertown on a Tuesday and there were very minimal line-ups for the rides! We took our 3 and 4 year old and they loved every minute of it! You can bring in your own food and drinks as they have limited food options available. There are plenty of picnic tables and",
          "Hello Trippies Tinkertown has its same charm it did 35 years ago except it has even more of it. The trees have matured, the whole park is now quite gorgeous and well maintained. On hot days there's plenty of shade with the old large trees. Tinkertown offer such great",
          "I hadn't been to Tinkertown since I was about my kids age (4 and 6). I used to love going there, but I think it has gotten better. First off, like the title says, a family of 4 can ride all day, have lunch, and tire the kids out for about $100. Give or take... Anybody who",
          "Tiny tots have a blast. Good for kids up to twelve or thirteen, but the younger ones seem to enjoy more. Specific section geared even for the really little ones.",
          "Free admission!!! Free parking!!! Very reasonable prices for wristbands. You're allowed to bring in your own food. Plenty of tables, and picnic tables and grass to eat on. Reasonable food costs. Very reasonable prices for the games. Had an ATM with a resonance fee to use. Lots",

          "I haven't been to Tinkertown since I was a kid, but I have to say they have done a great job keeping this park in top shape. Plenty of child size rides, some that adults can accompany. Very clean park with friendly staff. Concession stands offer many options for good prices.",
          "I remember taking my kids to Tinkertown when they were small, and now I am taking my grandchildren there and the place just has not changed. Be prepared to spend the entire day and watch the kids go from one ride to another. The park is completely enclosed which I like.",

          "We went in summer of 2013 for the first time ever and were absolutely pleased with the experience! Our children were 5 and 6, and I could see them outgrowing this place around twelve years old, but for the time being, what a great value! Food there was good and reasonably",
          "You can have a reasonably priced day for all of the family and a ton of fun on all the rides. Bring a picnic lunch or have something at their canteen. If you are on a tight budget it is one of the best places to go. For my family we always had a great time.",

          "We have been going a few times - every summer - for the past several years - with various grandchildren. They absolutely adore it! There are many rides to choose from -- for different age groups - and a $15.00 bracelet will give them unlimited rides. We buy a few single tickets,",

          "My kids loved all the rides, especially the bumper cars,when they were little. Purchasing one wristband will allow your child to go on as many rides as they like for the day. It is also a good location, and not too large, if your children are on the younger side.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Assiniboine Park (formerly known as City Park) is a park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Winnipeg Public Parks Board was formed in 1893, and purchased the initial land for the park in 1904. Although in use before then, the park officially opened in 1909, and is located north of the Assiniboine Forest, along the Assiniboine River. It is named for the Assiniboine people. The park covers 1,100 acres (450 ha), of which 400 acres (160 ha) are designed in the English landscape style.\nThe park includes the 700-acre (280 ha) Assiniboine Forest, Assiniboine Park Zoo, Assiniboine Park Conservatory, the historic Assiniboine Park Pavilion, formal and informal gardens, a sculpture garden, a miniature railway, an outdoor theatre for performing arts, and numerous other attractions. \n\n\n== Prominent attractions ==\n\n\n=== Conservatory and gardens ===\nOne of the earliest park features and a major indoor attraction, The Conservatory is a botanical garden housing more than 8,000 flowers, plants and trees that are non-native to Manitoba, but which grow profusely under the ideal conditions created in the Palm House and Display Garden. The original Palm House was erected in 1914, and in 1968 a fully modern structure was built over and around the Palm House, enclosing it.It was announced in early 2018 that the Assiniboine Park Conservatory would close permanently in April 2018 due to ongoing renovation costs and it reaching the end of its \"useful life\". The building has since been demolished, and usage of the existing space has not been determined. In 2018 a group of citizens spoke out about the future Diversity Gardens, that visitors will have to pay an admission fee like at the Zoo, and that this will cause lower income citizens to be unable to afford to visit the new displays.Known throughout North America for its luxuriant display of thousands of annual and perennial flowers, the English Garden (established between 1926 and 1927) contains nearly three acres of flowers, shrubs and trees arranged in the traditional English style. From the outset, the English Garden was designed to serve as a popular park attraction where local residents and tourists could obtain information about specialized floriculture in Manitoba. New plant varieties have been introduced annually. A large rose garden (with more than 400 bushes (there are only a few remnants of roses in this area.) of Floribunda, Grandiflora and Rugosa varieties), broken into four sections, surrounds a central, fish-filled lily pond. (No roses exist in this area, the central pond has a large fountain in it, no fish or lilies exist.)\nThe English Garden is open free of charge to the public every day of the year.\nThe Formal Garden, located at the southeast park entrance, was designed in 1907 by Frederick Todd as part of the original park. It features flower beds in sharply defined geometric shapes that stand out from the grassy areas. Each of the beds, as well as the overall design, is symmetrical.The Leo Mol Sculpture Garden displays more than three hundred works by Dr. Leo Mol, including bronze and ceramic sculptures, paintings and drawings. Opened in 1992, the sculpture garden has been expanded twice since.\n\n\n=== Pavilion and theatre ===\n\nThe park's signature feature, the Assiniboine Park Pavilion became a focus of early Winnipeg's social life. Originally designed by John D. Atchison and built in 1908, it included a dance hall, a banquet hall, lunch and catering. The 90-foot (27 m) tower contained the pump and water tower for the park's water system. It was destroyed by fire in May 1929. The current larger pavilion was designed by architects Northwood and Chivers, and was opened in May 1930. It is today one of Winnipeg's most familiar landmarks.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre is a large outdoor stage located next to the Pavilion.  Opened in 1999, it carries on the tradition of bandshell entertainment near the Pavilion that started in the 1920s.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe  90 acres (36 ha) Assiniboine Park Zoo is at the western end of the park just North of the main parking area, and is home to over 300 animal species. It initially opened in July 1908.\n\n\n=== Foot Bridge ===\nThe first foot bridge was built in 1908 when the Park had initially opened. However, in later years it was determined that a wider and safer bridge would be needed.\nA second bridge, connecting the suburb of St. James (at Overdale St.) with Assiniboine Park is an active transportation/pedestrian bridge, and officially opened in May 1932 by Winnipeg Mayor Ralph Webb.\n\n\n=== Duck Pond ===\n\nToward the north of the park, and just to one side of the pedestrian footbridge from Portage Avenue is the serpentine Duck Pond. Originally a fenced area, in the 2010s the Duck Pond was upgraded with new plants and benches. Although called a duck pond, it is more common to find Canada geese swimming there.\n\n\n=== Children's Nature and Adventure Playground ===\nOpened in May 2011 as part of the Park's redevelopment, a 0.81 ha (2-acre) Children's Nature and Adventure Playground was built as a children's play area. It is located adjacent to the Pavilion and cost $6 million. The play area features a kid-size doorway, although adult throughway is also provided. The relocated Winnie the Pooh statue is inside the Nature Playground area.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAdjacent to Roblin Boulevard, the last steam locomotive to run scheduled service in Canada, CNR 6043, Class U-1-d, 4-8-2, is on permanent display courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum.  A 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railway named Assiniboine Park Railroad operates in one section of the park, which features a working steam locomotive made by Crown Metal Products.  Additionally, a private rideable miniature railway named the Assiniboine Valley Railway, with a track gauge of 7 1\u20442 in (190.5 mm), is located outside the park near the zoo.\nThe park also includes picnic areas.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe park offers playgrounds, a bicycle path, baseball and cricket fields with three cricket pitches (upper and lower grounds) and a clubhouse on site. The park is the Manitoba Cricket League's premier facility for hosting club cricket. (Turf wickets are going to be installed on the cricket field and used for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2012).\nThe Terry Fox Fitness Trail, dedicated to the Canadian humanitarian's memory, is designed for disabled and non-disabled individuals alike. Assiniboine Park is wheelchair-accessible.\n\n\n== Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project ==\nThe Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project strives to help the riparian forest bounce back from heavy use and enhance the recreational trail experience. The ongoing riverbank restoration project, begun in 2006, continues each summer.The project concerns the strip of forest along the Assiniboine River within Assiniboine Park, a well-known and much-loved recreational area just east of the footbridge on the south side of Portage Avenue. Over many years, the forest has suffered a loss of vegetation due to flooding, invasive plant species that replace native species, and trampling from recreational activities such as hiking and biking. Generations of heavy usage has resulted in the creation of an extensive trail network, soil compaction and large areas of bare ground.Restoration is underway in the forest through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\nWinnipeg arts and culture\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSpector, David (2019).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Vital (French: Saint-Vital) is a district of the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Located in the south-central part of the city, it is bounded on the north by Carri\u00e8re Avenue, on the south by the northern limit of the Rural Municipality of Ritchot, on the west by the Red River and on the east by the Seine River, with the exception of the part lying south of the Perimeter Highway, which extends east across the Seine to the boundary of the Rural Municipality of Springfield. The population as of the 2016 census was 67,580.St. Vital is a city ward, represented by a member of Winnipeg City Council. With slightly different boundaries, it also comprises the Winnipeg neighbourhood clusters of St. Vital North and St. Vital South.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe community was established by francophone settlers in 1822, and is the second-oldest permanent settlement in Manitoba after Kildonan.  It was named  St. Vital by Archbishop Tach\u00e9 in 1860, in honour of the patron saint of his colleague, Father Vital-Justin Grandin.The original Parish of St. Vital consisted in present-day St. Vital in addition to much of Fort Garry, another present-day suburb on the west side of the Red River. The parish was home to many French-speaking settlers, particularly M\u00e9tis, a heritage that continues to be reflected in the names of many of its institutions and streets\nSt. Vital remained a strongly francophone community in the early decades after Manitoba's incorporation as a Canadian province in 1870. Until 1910, every reeve and every councillor was of a francophone background. The anglophone population grew throughout this period, however, and Richard Wilson was elected as St. Vital's first anglophone reeve in 1912. Council business was conducted in English after 1913.  The municipal government became more pro-business after this period, and supported municipal expansion: St. Vital's population increased from only 1,800 at the end of World War I to 11,000 in 1933. By 1951, 63% of St. Vital's population was of British background, and the francophone population had fallen to under 13%.  As of 2006, 17.4% of residents of St. Vital speak either both English and French or French only, while 82% speak English only and 0.6% speak neither English nor French.In 1923 St. Vital adopted the Single Transferable Voting system for its municipal elections. This system was in use until St. Vital merged with the City of Winnipeg in 1972.In 1926 the municipality faced bankruptcy, as municipal growth outstripped tax revenues. Control of the municipality was assumed by the provincial Municipal and Public Utilities Board for one year.From 1920 to 1958, St. Vital was part of the provincial electoral division of St. Boniface.St. Vital became involved in a school controversy in 1963\u201364, when six francophone families took their children out of school to protest bus fees for parochial school students.  The matter was resolved following a three-month standoff.The district was seriously affected by the 1950 Red River Flood; at one point, the entire developed area of St. Vital was under water. The neighbourhoods of Kingston Crescent and Elm Park were the hardest hit. The fire hall in Elm Park was protected with sandbags and sheltered dozens of evacuees, as shown in a photo published in the May 1, 1950 edition of Life magazine.St. Vital was a separate municipality until 1971. It originally held the status of a rural municipality, and was then incorporated as a town and then eventually a city. Some residents were reluctant to amalgamate with Winnipeg in 1971, and the former municipal government held a mock burial of the city crest.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nWith the exception of a significant (though diminishing) semi-rural district in the south, St. Vital is almost entirely residential and has never been home to significant industrial or commercial enterprises, other than retail shops.\nIts attractions include the St. Vital Centre, a major regional shopping centre that opened in October 1979, the Riel House National Historic Site (consisting in the home of the family of M\u00e9tis leader Louis Riel, restored to its 1886 condition), and St. Vital Park, one of Winnipeg's largest city parks. Maple Grove Park is similar in size to St. Vital Park but more recently established. A system of linear parks along the Seine River is under development on the east side of the suburb. Guay Park in north St. Vital contains a war memorial erected in honour of St. Vital residents killed in the two World Wars and in Korea.\nSt. Vital Outdoor Pool was opened in 1967 as a Centennial project, and was renovated in the 2010s.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\nSt. Vital includes many working-class and middle-class neighbourhoods. Among them are Elm Park, Varennes, Pulberry, Glenwood, Norberry, Minnetonka (also known as Riel), River Park South, Meadowood Park and Normand Park.\nMajor streets in St. Vital include St. Mary's Road, St. Anne's Road, Bishop Grandin Boulevard, Fermor Avenue (part of the Trans-Canada Highway), Nova Vista, Warde Ave., Beliveau Rd., Meadowood Ave., and Dunkirk Drive (and its southerly extension, Dakota Street).\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe St. Vital area contains a number of community centres, including the St. Vital Centennial Arena and the Jonathan Toews Community Centre (formerly the Dakota Community Centre).  The St. Vital Victorias are members of the Manitoba Major Junior Hockey League, while the Winnipeg Saints played in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League from 2000\u20132012. Maple Grove Park is home to the St. Vital Mustangs Football Club and Manitoba's largest rugby complex.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost public schools are operated by the Louis Riel School Division; the exceptions are two schools for francophones in south St. Vital operated by the Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine. There are also two parochial schools administered by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface, and a number of private schools.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe only major health care facility in St. Vital is St. Amant, located on River Road in the Minnetonka neighbourhood. It was originally a tuberculosis hospital, but was repurposed as a facility for developmentally challenged children in 1959. In 1974 it was renamed to honour Beatrice St. Amant. The neighbouring suburb of Fort Richmond is home to the Victoria General Hospital and nearby St.Boniface is home to the province's second largest hospital, St. Boniface General Hospital (Winnipeg).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nTodd MacCulloch, Former NBA player\nGabrielle Roy, Author\nNancy Allan, Politician\nSara Orlesky, Sports reporter\nAndrea Slobodian, Reporter\nSami Jo Small, Hockey player\nJonathan Toews Winner of an ESPY Award for being the best hockey player of 2015\nAdam Smoluk: Actor, Screenwriter, and Director\nNigel Dawes: Professional hockey player.\nReid Carruthers: World Men's Curling Champion\nLaurie Hawn: Member of Parliament\nNia Vardalos, actress in My Big Fat Greek Wedding\nJim Agnew, Hockey player\nClint Albright, Hockey player\nGary Aldcorn, Hockey player\nBill Allum, Hockey player\nCarter Ashton, Hockey player\nDoug Baldwin, Hockey player\nCam Barker, Hockey player\nAndy Bathgate, Hockey player\nKen Baumgartner, Hockey player\nPaul Baxter, Hockey player\nGordie Bell, Hockey player\nJoe Bell, Hockey player\nGary Bergman, Hockey player\nGarry Blaine, Hockey player\nAndy Blair , Hockey player\nRick Blight, Hockey player\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSt. Vital, Man.

        "wiki": "Winnipeg, or Winnie, (1914 \u2013 12 May 1934) was the name given to a female black bear that lived at London Zoo from 1915 until her death in 1934.  Rescued by cavalry veterinarian Harry Colebourn, Winnie is best-remembered for inspiring A. A. Milne's character, Winnie-the-Pooh.\nUpon the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Lt. Harry Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian cavalry regiment, volunteered his service. On 24 August, while en route to Valcartier to report to the Canadian Army Veterinary Corps (CAVC) as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he purchased a young bear cub for $20 at a train stop in White River, Ontario.  The bear's mother was probably killed in the spring of 1914 when the cub was very young and could most easily have become socialized to humans. The name of the hunter who sold the bear and who presumably provided the bear's early socialization is undocumented. Colebourn named the bear \"Winnipeg\", \"Winnie\" for short, after his home city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Winnie accompanied him to Valcartier and all the way to England, becoming the mascot of the CAVC and a pet to the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade Headquarters.  Before leaving for France, Colebourn left Winnie at London Zoo.Winnie's eventual destination was to have been the Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, but at the end of the War, Colebourn decided to allow Winnie to remain at the London Zoo, where she was much loved for her playfulness and gentleness.  Among her fans was A. A. Milne's son Christopher Robin, who consequently changed the name of his own teddy bear from \"Edward Bear\" to \"Winnie the Pooh\", providing the inspiration for his father's stories about Winnie-the-Pooh.Winnipeg's skull was kept after her death in the Odontological Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons Hunterian Museum in London, and went on public display for the first time in 2015.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nThere are several statues and plaques commemorating the popular bear. The London Zoo has 1981 statue of Winnie by sculptor Lorne McKean.  A statue of Winnie and Colebourn together by sculptor William Epp stands in Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg, in the park's Nature Playground; Epp's design is also seen in another statue at the London Zoo.\nIn 1996, Canada Post issued \"Winnie and Lieutenant Colebourn, White River, 1914\" designed by Wai Poon with art direction by Anthony Van Bruggen and computer design by Marcelo Caetano. The 45\u00a2 stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Canada Limited.The story of Winnie the bear was portrayed in the 2004 movie A Bear Named Winnie starring Michael Fassbender as Colebourn and Bonkers, a 1,000-pound male American black bear, as the adult Winnie. In 2011, Winnipeg author M.A. Appleby, whose father was a friend of Colebourn's son, wrote a children's book about the bear's life titled Winnie the Bear.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWojtek (bear)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Winnipeg the Bear at Wikimedia Commons\nA Bear Named Winnie TV movie (2004) on IMDb\n\"Winnie-the-Pooh makes his literary debut\", 1987 interview with Colebourn's son, CBC Digital Archives\nRemembering the Real Winnie: The World's Most Famous Bear Turns 100 website hosted by Ryerson University",

        "wiki": "Riel House is a National Historic Site commemorating the life of the M\u00e9tis politician and activist Louis Riel, and also the daily life of M\u00e9tis families in the Red River Settlement. The house is situated in the historic St. Vital parish, Winnipeg in Manitoba Canada. From 1865, the residence belonged to Riel's mother, Julie Riel (Lagimodi\u00e8re), and housed his brothers and their families. Louis Riel lived along with them from his return to Red River in 1868, through the Red River Resistance, until his exile in 1870. It is also where his body lay in state for two days in December 1885 after his sentencing and execution for murder and treason, before being buried in St. Boniface. \nThe house remained within the possession of Riel descendants until 1968, when it was acquired by the Winnipeg Historical Society.\nThe house was restored to its 1886 condition, and converted into a museum. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1976 and a Federal Heritage Building in 2000. It is owned and administered by Parks Canada, but since 2013 the Louis Riel Institute (an associate of the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation) has provided interpretation and programming.\n\n\n== External links ==\nRiel House National Historic Site of Canada\nAbout Riel House\nThe Woman\u2019s Sphere: Domestic Life at Riel House and Dalnavert\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Exchange District is a National Historic Site of Canada in the downtown area of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Just one block north of Portage and Main, the Exchange District comprises twenty city blocks and approximately 150 heritage buildings, and it is known for its intact early 20th century collection of warehouses, financial institutions, and early terra cotta clad skyscrapers.The Exchange is home to the Manitoba Museum as well as the Planetarium and a Science Gallery.\nThe Exchange District spans two distinct areas, the East Exchange and the West Exchange. The east Exchange area is located between the Disraeli Bridge, Waterfront Drive, William Stephenson Way and Main Street, and the West Exchange is bounded by Adelaide Street, Ross Avenue, Notre Dame Avenue and Main Street.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Exchange District\u2019s name originates from the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, the former centre of the grain industry in Canada, as well as other commodity exchanges which developed in Winnipeg between 1881\u20131918, some of which are still active today. (see Winnipeg Commodity Exchange)\nWinnipeg was one of the fastest growing cities in North America around the turn of the 20th century. The city became known as the Chicago of the North. Much of Winnipeg\u2019s remaining  architecture of the late 1800s and early 1900s is heavily influenced by the Chicago style. By 1911, Winnipeg had become the third largest city in Canada. At the time it had more than two dozen rail lines converging near the city centre along with over 200 wholesale businesses.World War I and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 slowed Winnipeg's growth, as there was a new route for shipping goods from Eastern Canada and Europe to Western Canada and from East Asia to the larger markets on the Eastern seaboard. As wholesale operations began to open in other Western Canadian cities, such as Edmonton, Moose Jaw, and Regina, Winnipeg's importance as a wholesale centre declined in the 1910s and 1920s. By the 1940s, many of the warehouses in the Exchange District had been converted into uses related to the garment trade. \nAs Winnipeg began to experience growth in the years following World War II, much of Winnipeg\u2019s downtown development shifted to the area of downtown south of Portage Avenue, particularly along Broadway and on towards Osborne Village. The lack of new development, mixed with the existing demand for inexpensive wholesaling and manufacturing space, left the Exchange District largely intact. As a result, Winnipeg today has one of the most historically intact early 20th century commercial districts in North America.In the early 1980s the streetscaping in the area was improved with the creation of wider sidewalks, historically appropriate street furniture, lighting, and decorative paving patterns and materials.On September 27, 1997, the Winnipeg Exchange District was declared a National Historic Site by then federal Minister of Canadian Heritage, Sheila Copps.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nThe Exchange District today thrives as one of Winnipeg's commercial and cultural centers, as home to an array of specialty retailers, restaurants, nightclubs, art galleries, wholesalers, and condos. \n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nWinnipeg's theatre district is located on the east side of the Exchange District, home to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, and Centennial Concert Hall which houses the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the Manitoba Opera.The west side of the Exchange is home to Cinematheque, a small movie theatre located on the main floor of the Artspace building on Albert Street.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nRed River College's Roblin Centre is a 220,000-square-foot (20,000 m2)  building that features the original fa\u00e7ades along Princess Street, and incorporates modern green building technology. The Roblin Centre's construction merged five prominent heritage buildings on Princess Street as well as a 1905 warehouse on William Avenue. It is home to approximately 200 staff and 2,000 students. The Centre has a focus on modern media, information technology, and business.The Paterson Globalfoods Institute is a new addition to Red River College's Exchange District Campus as of 2013. The Institute is located at the Union Bank Building, an 11 storey building that dates back to 1903, and is the home of the Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Tourism Management and Professional Baking and Patisserie programs.\n\n\n=== Old Market Square ===\n\nOld Market Square hosts the annual Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and the Manitoba Electronic Music Exhibition. Its cobblestone streets and friendly pedestrian environment also contribute to The Exchange District's popularity as a period backdrop for the movie industry. Most notably the 2006 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Brad Pitt, and the 2006 film The Lookout starring Jeff Daniels.\nOld Market Square originated in 1889, initially as a public market building. Originally located on the site of what is now the Public Safety Building, it was the centre of Winnipeg's early commercial trade. In 1964 to 1965, the original building as well as several nearby structures were razed to make room for the current Civic Centre. In 1970, an \"Old Market Square Association\" was created to lobby for the preservation and improvement of the site.In 1976, the national historic trust, Heritage Canada, announced a $500,000 grant to towards the purchase and restoration of significant buildings in the Old Market Square area, with a focus on Albert Street and what was then known as \"Albert Street Park\". The park became the venue for a farmer's market which brought momentum to the rejuvenation of the area. In 1990, a permanent stage was built in the park.Begun in 2008 and completed in 2012, a revitalization program began that improved landscaping, drainage, sod and lighting. Developed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the new area features a performance space, a sunken event lawn, serpentine seating wall and seating planters encircling elm trees.  The focal point of the renovation was \"The Cube\", a new $1.5 million stage, with a skin made up of 20,000 aluminum links. Designed by 5468796 Architecture, the stage contains a built-in lighting system, green room and two performance levels, and was funded by the Winnipeg Foundation, CentreVenture and several levels of government. The 28-foot (8.5 m) by 28-foot (8.5 m) cube is composed of a flexible curtain of diamond extrusions strung together. The curtain can be drawn back to reveal the stage within.The cube has not functioned properly since it was opened in 2010. In summer 2012, the Cube was closed due to concerns about supports for the metal curtain. Repairs for the structure are planned for the spring of 2013 and are expected to include fixes for faulty lights and cooling fans, additional railings and handrails, alterations to the rear of the stage and accessibility improvements.Plans are underway to redevelop the 2.4 acres (0.97 ha) site of the former Public Safety Building and Parkade (c. 1966). CentreVenture is in charge of choosing the design of Marketlands, featuring a farmers market and residential component. Demolition of the PSB will take place starting in the fall of 2019.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThere are no high speed roads that pass through or near the Exchange District. Regular urban speed limits are observed on Portage Avenue, Main Street on the boundaries of the area.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nThere is a painted cycling lane along McDermot Ave. between Main St. and the HSC campus.\n\n\n=== Transit ===\nSeveral transit routes travel through the Exchange District: 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 15, 16,  17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 32, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.\n\n\n=== Boat ===\nAt one time the Alexander Docks functioned as an urban dock in downtown Winnipeg which tourist riverboat the Paddlewheel Queen and others had used for decades. This has since been shut down and is in the process of being updated.\n\n\n== Proposals ==\n\n\n=== Albert St. Pedestrian Mall ===\n\nA pedestrian mall was proposed for the area in August 2010 by local architect Brent Bellamy. The proposed pedestrian mall would be located along two blocks of Albert Street to the Old Market Square and closed to automobile traffic. The hope of the mall would be to accentuate the uniqueness of the neighbourhood, attract workers from Portage and Main, and be sustained over the long-term with residential development in the area.\n\n\n=== Centennial Centre ===\nAs the Centennial Centre area (Concert Hall, Manitoba Theatre Centre, Museum and Planetarium) are now over 50 years of age, there is a plan to upgrade and expand the venues.\n\n\n=== Alexander Docks ===\nThe city had issued an RFP in 2007 to redevelop the Alexander Docks site, which had been built by the Federal government in 1929. Liberal Senator Rod Zimmer won the bidding process thru his proposed  $10 million development plan which would include a boutique hotel (restaurant, meeting space) and marina.A consortium comprising CentreVenture, the Manitoba Association of Architects, The Forks, the Exchange District BIZ, as well as several architectural firms held an international design competition, On the Docks, in 2018 for the redevelopment of Alexander Docks. Over 200 designs were entered. The winner of the design competition was Cornoiu Sabin of Romania for his \"Alexander's Garden\".\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2016 census, the Exchange District has approximately 0.10% of Winnipeg's population with 630 people (+41.6%), up from 445 at the time of the 2011 census. The Exchange District makes up 0.1% of the city's total land area.The district's population age is wide between early twenties and up; there is no dominant age group of residents. The district has a lower proportion of visible minorities, with only 13.5%, as compared to 28% for the whole of Winnipeg. Over 30.6% of respondents in the district reported as \"Never married (single)\", as compared to 31.4% of Winnipeg. The district lends itself to pedestrian travel: over 44.3% of employed respondents stated walking as their primary mode of transportation, significantly higher than the 4.9% reported for the entire city. The average employment income in the Exchange District is $79,831, as compared to $61,164 for Winnipeg as a whole.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWinnipeg arts and culture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nExchange District BIZ\nExchange District BIZ - Walking Tours in the Exchange\nHeritage Winnipeg - The Exchange District",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Transcona is a suburb of Winnipeg, Manitoba, located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) east of the downtown area. Until 1972 it was a separate municipality, having been incorporated first as the Town of Transcona on 6 April 1912  and then as the City of Transcona in 1961. Today it is represented by the Transcona city ward, represented by a member of Winnipeg City Council, and, with much larger boundaries including large areas that were part of the Municipality of North Kildonan, much of the area west of Plessis, the Transcona neighbourhood cluster. It is primarily a working class residential area with some light industry.\n\n\n== History ==\nTranscona was founded in 1909 as the site of the repair shops for the Grand Trunk Pacific and National Transcontinental Railways. Its name is derived from combining Transcontinental with Strathcona, the name of Donald Smith, Lord Strathcona, a former Manitoban who was instrumental in building the Canadian Pacific Railway. Today the Canadian National Railway is still a major employer in the community. CNR 2747 a Class N-5-c, 2-8-0 steam locomotive on display at the corner of Plessis Road and Kildare Avenue in the Kiwanis Park courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum. The locomotive is the first steam locomotive built in 1926, totally at CNR Transcona Shops.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n1907 - Canadian Pacific builds additional railway tracks near district in the Municipality of Kildonan (CPR)\n1908 - Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) decides on Transcona as location for railway shops and buys 800 acres (3.2 km2) of land. Name of Transcona adopted for future town. Townsite was originally to be created in what is now the South Transcona area, but this area was low lying and subject to flooding so main townsite was  moved north of shops.\n1909 - Haney, Quinlan and Robertson start work on excavation for the foundation of the new shops\n1910 (January 1) - first steel pillar is raised in the new shop building, and  the post office opened\n1911 (February 10) - first Board of Trade is organized.\n1912 (April 6) - Town of Transcona receives its charter, and on November 12 Municipal offices and Fire Hall opened for Public Inspection. The first electric light and power installed from Pointe du Bois generating station of Winnipeg Hydro. Central School officially opened but classes do not begin until 1913.\n1913 (January 18) - GTP shops opened, on April 10 Mayor Transcona presents Morley Donaldson, Vice-President of GTP, with golden key as memento of shop opening. CPR builds grain elevator and opens yards near Transcona in the Municipality of Springfield and the Municipality of Kildonan. In October, the grain elevator tilts due to failure of its foundations, becoming a textbook example of the importance of soil mechanics. It is later restored.1914 - Sewage system installed\n1915-1918 - GTP shops engaged in manufacture of munitions\n1919 - Shoal Lake water connection for Town. Transcona athletic organization\n1919 - Biggest sports field in Transcona's history held\n1921 - Having run out of money, the town council dissolves, and the town is run until 1928 by provincially-appointed administrators1926 - First locomotive built in CNR shops\n\n1929 - New post office built\n1930 - Transcona Horticultural Society organized\n1933 - Effects of the Great Depression hit Transcona. At the peak the town is paying the rent for 192 families.1942 - HMCS Transcona is commissioned, a Bangor-class minesweeper named for the town. The vessel participates in anti-submarine combat in the North Atlantic in December 1944.1950 - The Red River floods. Some Winnipeg residents are temporarily sheltered in Transcona churches.\n1961 - Becomes City of Transcona\n1972 - Amalgamated with the City of Winnipeg along with 11 other communities\n\n\n== Geography and population ==\nIn 2016, Transcona was home to 36,280 people. Though the majority of the area consists of houses built several decades ago, there are newer developments located in the east and northwest sections of the community including Canterbury Park, Lakeside Meadows, and Mission Gardens. Transcona's future expansion is limited by the presence of the Red River Floodway and the Perimeter Highway.\n\n\n== Education and government ==\nTranscona is part of the Elmwood-Transcona federal electoral district represented in the Canadian House of Commons by Daniel Blaikie of the New Democratic Party of Canada. In the Manitoba Legislature, the representatives are Daryl Reid and partly by Bidhu Jha, of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba.\nIn 1959, the Transcona-Springfield School Division was created, supported jointly by the Town of Transcona and the Rural Municipality of Springfield for high school education only, and administered by a School Board of nine officials. The Transcona School District No. 39 remained for elementary and junior high students. The School Division and Transcona School District merged in 1967. In 2002, the Transcona part of the former Transcona-Springfield School Division and the River East School Division were united as the River East Transcona School Division.\n\n\n=== Elementary schools ===\nBernie Wolfe Community School\nEcole Centrale (Winnipeg)\nEcole Margaret-Underhill\nHarold Hatcher Elementary School\nJoseph Teres School\nRadisson School\nWayoata Elementary School\nWestview Elementary School (Winnipeg)\nSt. Joseph The Worker School\n\n\n=== Middle schools ===\nArthur Day Middle School\nBernie Wolfe Community School\nEcole Regent Park School\nJohn W. Gunn Middle School\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nTranscona Collegiate Institute (TCI)\nMurdoch MacKay Collegiate\nColl\u00e8ge Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau\n\n\n=== French-immersion schools ===\nColl\u00e8ge Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau\n\u00c9cole Regent Park School\n\u00c9cole Centrale\n\u00c9cole Margaret-Underhill\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nThe neighbourhood has produced several celebrities, including sports commentator Rod Black, former MuchMusic on-air personality Bradford How, Canadian athlete and cancer research activist Terry Fox, professional wrestler Kenny Omega, and Olympic speed skater Susan Auch.\nIn 2005, following in the style of CBC's The Greatest Canadian series, the Transcona Historical Museum sponsored their own local version called \"The Greatest Transconian.\"  The award was given to citizen Paul Martin. Mr. Martin was a Second World War veteran with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, a long-serving City Councillor, former Mayor of Transcona (1958-1959), and member of the School Board. He was influential in creating the Transcona Historical Museum.Professional wrestler Kenny Omega (born Tyson Smith) was born and raised in Transcona, and in 2018 became the first Canadian-born IWGP Heavyweight Champion in the title's history. This follows a career in Japanese professional wrestling that includes a number of championship wins across weight classes.\n\n\n== Sport and recreation ==\nTranscona is the home of Football Manitoba sports team the Transcona Nationals which has age groups ranging from 7 to 21.\nThree major community clubs and two indoor arenas can be found in the neighbourhood. Park City West, Oxford Heights, and East End Community Clubs organize a variety of recreational activities, while East End and Roland Michener arenas host most on-ice activities.\nFrom 1983 to September 10, 2011, Transcona was represented by the Transcona Railers Hockey team in the MMJHL who played out of the Roland Michener Arena. They were disbanded because the team found it hard to draw players of the required skill levels and numbers. A team of railers alumni applied for membership into the MMJHL. On January 7, 2012, the league board accepted the new Transcona franchise for the 2012-2013 season. The new team plays at the newly renovated east end arena in the new side of the building. \n\n\n== See also ==\nFor the film production company Transcona Enterprises, see Judy Garland\nTranscona (electoral district)\nTranscona Historical Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTranscona Museum History of Transcona retrieved 2012 Jan 4",

      "name": "Assiniboine Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Assiniboine Park (formerly known as City Park) is a park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Winnipeg Public Parks Board was formed in 1893, and purchased the initial land for the park in 1904. Although in use before then, the park officially opened in 1909, and is located north of the Assiniboine Forest, along the Assiniboine River. It is named for the Assiniboine people. The park covers 1,100 acres (450 ha), of which 400 acres (160 ha) are designed in the English landscape style.\nThe park includes the 700-acre (280 ha) Assiniboine Forest, Assiniboine Park Zoo, Assiniboine Park Conservatory, the historic Assiniboine Park Pavilion, formal and informal gardens, a sculpture garden, a miniature railway, an outdoor theatre for performing arts, and numerous other attractions. \n\n\n== Prominent attractions ==\n\n\n=== Conservatory and gardens ===\nOne of the earliest park features and a major indoor attraction, The Conservatory is a botanical garden housing more than 8,000 flowers, plants and trees that are non-native to Manitoba, but which grow profusely under the ideal conditions created in the Palm House and Display Garden. The original Palm House was erected in 1914, and in 1968 a fully modern structure was built over and around the Palm House, enclosing it.It was announced in early 2018 that the Assiniboine Park Conservatory would close permanently in April 2018 due to ongoing renovation costs and it reaching the end of its \"useful life\". The building has since been demolished, and usage of the existing space has not been determined. In 2018 a group of citizens spoke out about the future Diversity Gardens, that visitors will have to pay an admission fee like at the Zoo, and that this will cause lower income citizens to be unable to afford to visit the new displays.Known throughout North America for its luxuriant display of thousands of annual and perennial flowers, the English Garden (established between 1926 and 1927) contains nearly three acres of flowers, shrubs and trees arranged in the traditional English style. From the outset, the English Garden was designed to serve as a popular park attraction where local residents and tourists could obtain information about specialized floriculture in Manitoba. New plant varieties have been introduced annually. A large rose garden (with more than 400 bushes (there are only a few remnants of roses in this area.) of Floribunda, Grandiflora and Rugosa varieties), broken into four sections, surrounds a central, fish-filled lily pond. (No roses exist in this area, the central pond has a large fountain in it, no fish or lilies exist.)\nThe English Garden is open free of charge to the public every day of the year.\nThe Formal Garden, located at the southeast park entrance, was designed in 1907 by Frederick Todd as part of the original park. It features flower beds in sharply defined geometric shapes that stand out from the grassy areas. Each of the beds, as well as the overall design, is symmetrical.The Leo Mol Sculpture Garden displays more than three hundred works by Dr. Leo Mol, including bronze and ceramic sculptures, paintings and drawings. Opened in 1992, the sculpture garden has been expanded twice since.\n\n\n=== Pavilion and theatre ===\n\nThe park's signature feature, the Assiniboine Park Pavilion became a focus of early Winnipeg's social life. Originally designed by John D. Atchison and built in 1908, it included a dance hall, a banquet hall, lunch and catering. The 90-foot (27 m) tower contained the pump and water tower for the park's water system. It was destroyed by fire in May 1929. The current larger pavilion was designed by architects Northwood and Chivers, and was opened in May 1930. It is today one of Winnipeg's most familiar landmarks.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre is a large outdoor stage located next to the Pavilion.  Opened in 1999, it carries on the tradition of bandshell entertainment near the Pavilion that started in the 1920s.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe  90 acres (36 ha) Assiniboine Park Zoo is at the western end of the park just North of the main parking area, and is home to over 300 animal species. It initially opened in July 1908.\n\n\n=== Foot Bridge ===\nThe first foot bridge was built in 1908 when the Park had initially opened. However, in later years it was determined that a wider and safer bridge would be needed.\nA second bridge, connecting the suburb of St. James (at Overdale St.) with Assiniboine Park is an active transportation/pedestrian bridge, and officially opened in May 1932 by Winnipeg Mayor Ralph Webb.\n\n\n=== Duck Pond ===\n\nToward the north of the park, and just to one side of the pedestrian footbridge from Portage Avenue is the serpentine Duck Pond. Originally a fenced area, in the 2010s the Duck Pond was upgraded with new plants and benches. Although called a duck pond, it is more common to find Canada geese swimming there.\n\n\n=== Children's Nature and Adventure Playground ===\nOpened in May 2011 as part of the Park's redevelopment, a 0.81 ha (2-acre) Children's Nature and Adventure Playground was built as a children's play area. It is located adjacent to the Pavilion and cost $6 million. The play area features a kid-size doorway, although adult throughway is also provided. The relocated Winnie the Pooh statue is inside the Nature Playground area.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAdjacent to Roblin Boulevard, the last steam locomotive to run scheduled service in Canada, CNR 6043, Class U-1-d, 4-8-2, is on permanent display courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum.  A 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railway named Assiniboine Park Railroad operates in one section of the park, which features a working steam locomotive made by Crown Metal Products.  Additionally, a private rideable miniature railway named the Assiniboine Valley Railway, with a track gauge of 7 1\u20442 in (190.5 mm), is located outside the park near the zoo.\nThe park also includes picnic areas.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe park offers playgrounds, a bicycle path, baseball and cricket fields with three cricket pitches (upper and lower grounds) and a clubhouse on site. The park is the Manitoba Cricket League's premier facility for hosting club cricket. (Turf wickets are going to be installed on the cricket field and used for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2012).\nThe Terry Fox Fitness Trail, dedicated to the Canadian humanitarian's memory, is designed for disabled and non-disabled individuals alike. Assiniboine Park is wheelchair-accessible.\n\n\n== Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project ==\nThe Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project strives to help the riparian forest bounce back from heavy use and enhance the recreational trail experience. The ongoing riverbank restoration project, begun in 2006, continues each summer.The project concerns the strip of forest along the Assiniboine River within Assiniboine Park, a well-known and much-loved recreational area just east of the footbridge on the south side of Portage Avenue. Over many years, the forest has suffered a loss of vegetation due to flooding, invasive plant species that replace native species, and trampling from recreational activities such as hiking and biking. Generations of heavy usage has resulted in the creation of an extensive trail network, soil compaction and large areas of bare ground.Restoration is underway in the forest through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\nWinnipeg arts and culture\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSpector, David (2019).

        "wiki": "St. Norbert (French: Saint-Norbert) is a bilingual (French and English) neighbourhood in the southernmost part of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. While outside the Perimeter Highway, (the orbital road that surrounds most of Winnipeg), it is still part of the city. At the 2016 Census, the population of St. Norbert is 5,850. \nEach summer, the community is home to the St. Norbert Farmers' Market, drawing large crowds from Winnipeg and the surrounding area. Other attractions include the St. Norbert Provincial Heritage Park, and the St. Norbert Arts and Cultural Centre. St. Norbert is the closest community to the Red River Floodway gates.\nSt. Norbert is also the name of a much bigger city ward in Winnipeg, which includes much of the Fort Garry South neighbourhood cluster and a small part of St. Vital. It is represented by a member of Winnipeg City Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original inhabitants of what is now St. Norbert were First Nations peoples, including the Assiniboine, the Cree\nand the Ojibwe, who were drawn to this region because of its hunting and fishing opportunities. The community bordered on two rivers \u2013 the Red and La Salle \u2013 and a bison trail ran from the south bank of the La Salle River to bison hunting grounds nearly 50 kilometres away.\nSt. Norbert\u2019s prime location along major trade and transportation routes proved advantageous. With the arrival of the French, the Scots, and other Europeans, and with the growth of the M\u00e9tis population, St. Norbert developed into a permanent community. The Pembina Trail (now Pembina Highway) passed through St. Norbert as it routed travellers from Upper Fort Garry (present day downtown Winnipeg, and the primary southern outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company) to St. Paul, Minnesota \u2013 the nearest railhead.\nThe settlement was elevated to the status of parish in 1857 and given the name St. Norbert in honour of the first bishop\nof St. Boniface, Bishop Joseph-Norbert Provencher. The first parish priest, Father Jean-Marie Lestanc, was followed by Father Charles Mestre in 1860, then by Father No\u00ebl-Joseph Ritchot in 1862.\nOn October 19, 1869, a public meeting was held at St. Norbert Roman Catholic Church. At that meeting, the Comite national des M\u00e9tis was formed, with Louis Riel as secretary. The first act of the committee was an erection of a barrier across the Pembina Trail to keep out unwanted emissaries of the Canadian Government.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Asile Ritchot ===\n\nVisible from Pembina highway, one of the most recognizable landmarks in St. Norbert is a large three-story building marked by a huge centre dome. Begun in the 1870s, the first building on the site was the home of politician and businessman Monsieur Joseph Lemay.  The building eventually came into the possession of the local church, and in 1903, Father No\u00ebl-Joseph Ritchot arranged the donation of the building and 80 acres (320,000 m2) of surrounding land to les Soeurs de Misericorde (Sisters of Mercy). The Sisters called the building Asile Ritchot and operated an orphanage there from 1904 to 1948. In 1911, a large expansion was begun. The new brick building was three stories tall, and featured the landmark centre dome. \nWhen Asile Ritchot closed its doors in 1948, the building was taken over by the Oblate Fathers, and used as a seminary. In 1970, the X-Kalay foundation (now called the Behavioral Health Foundation) took over the building and currently operates a successful halfway house for the support and rehabilitation of individuals with drug or alcohol issues.\n\n\n=== Trappist monastery ===\nAnother architectural landmark in St. Norbert is the former Trappist monastery, now an arts and cultural centre. In 1891, the Abbot of Bellefontaine in France agreed to establish a Trappist monastery on a secluded piece of parish land along the La Salle River, and monks arrived in St. Norbert in 1892. The order was dedicated to a life of prayer and hard work, following the basic tenets of St. Benedict \u2013 charity, obedience, and humility. The monks succeeded in building a large and prosperous agricultural operation complete with a sawmill, forge, apiary, cheese house, bakery and greenhouses. Between 30 and 45 monks inhabited the monastery at any given time. By 1975, St. Norbert had become a much more urban area, and the Trappist monks relocated to a more protected and rural location in Holland, Manitoba. In 1983, vandals set fire to the vacant chapel and monastery, reducing the historic buildings to shells. The guesthouse, located some distance away, remained untouched. In 1988, the Province of Manitoba designated the location a provincial historic site. The guesthouse became the home of the St. Norbert Arts Centre   in 1991. In 2002, the provincial government announced the creation of the two-hectare Trappist Monastery Provincial Park, preserving the historic ruins and preventing future commercial development on the site.\n\n\n=== Paroisse Catholique Saint-Norbert/St. Norbert Catholic Parish ===\nThe first church was built on the current site in 1857, and was made of logs. The newer building that replaced it in 1883 burned down in 1929. The current church was completed in 1937. The beautiful building has twin towers, and  houses the body of Father Joseph No\u00ebl Ritchot, St. Norbert\u2019s parish priest from 1862 to 1905. Father Ritchot was a supporter of the M\u00e9tis people, and of Louis Riel. Richot was a member of a delegation that travelled to Ottawa to meet with representatives of the Canadian government regarding the 1870 transfer of land in the Red River Settlement from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada. Across from the church is the tiny open-air Chapel of our Lady of Good Help (la Chapelle de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Secours). Ritchot and his parishioners built the chapel in 1875, to commemorate the success of the M\u00e9tis resistance of 1869\u201370. That dispute, eventually settled through negotiation, resulted in the inclusion of M\u00e9tis land, language, and school rights in The Manitoba Act of 1870, the basis of the Red River Settlement\u2019s entry into Confederation. In 1989, the chapel was declared a Manitoba provincial heritage site.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSt. Norbert is the southern gateway into the city of Winnipeg. Located just south of the Perimeter Highway, the community consists of what is called St. Norbert Village (the original community) and several modern suburbs.  The village is geographically bounded by the Red and LaSalle Rivers, and by the Perimeter Highway.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "A footbridge (also a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed solely for pedestrians. While the primary meaning for a bridge is a structure which links \"two points at a height above the ground\", a footbridge can also be a lower structure, such as a boardwalk, that enables pedestrians to cross wet, fragile, or marshy land. Bridges range from stepping stones\u2013possibly the earliest man-made structure to \"bridge\" water\u2013to elaborate steel structures. Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and artistic. \nFor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools, businesses and markets. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructed in such areas using only local materials and labor.\nAn enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a skyway. Bridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as greenbridges and form an important part of a sustainable transport system.\nFootbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads. They are also located across roads to let pedestrians cross safely without slowing traffic. The latter is a type of pedestrian separation structure, examples of which are particularly found near schools.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nThe simplest type of a bridge is stepping stones, so this may have been one of the earliest types of footbridge. Neolithic people also built a form of a boardwalk across marshes, of which the Sweet Track, and the Post Track are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old. Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used log bridges; that is a timber bridge that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.Among the oldest timber bridges is the Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden crossing upper Lake Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the Seedamm date back to 1523 B.C. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Z\u00fcrich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the Roman Empire built a 6-metre-wide (20 ft) wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 \u2013 measuring approximately 1,450 metres (4,760 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 ft) wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. \nA clapper bridge is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of Devon (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including Snowdonia and Anglesey, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Lancashire. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often granite or schist, supported on stone piers (across rivers), or resting on the banks of streams. Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in medieval times, and some in later centuries. A famous example is found in the village of Postbridge. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been originally built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river. Nowadays clapper bridges are only used as footbridges. \nThe Kapellbr\u00fccke is a 204-metre-long (669 ft) footbridge crossing the River Reuss in the city of Lucerne in Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, and one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions. The bridge was originally built c. 1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications.\nAn early example of a skyway is the Vasari Corridor, an elevated, enclosed passageway in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery  and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. It was built in five months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, to the design of Giorgio Vasari.\nBank Bridge is a famous 25 metre long pedestrian bridge crossing the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like other bridges across the canal, the existing structure dates from 1826. The special popularity of the bridge was gained through angular sculptures of four winged lions crowning the abutments. They were designed by sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835), who also contributed lions for Bridge of Lions.\n\n\n== Design ==\nDesign of footbridges normally follows the same principles as for other bridges. However, because they are normally significantly lighter than vehicular bridges, they are more vulnerable to vibration and therefore dynamics effects are often given more attention in design. International attention has been drawn to this issue in recent years by problems on the Pont de Solf\u00e9rino in Paris and the Millennium Bridge in London.\nTo ensure footbridges are accessible to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is nowadays also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, as required by relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK). Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a stairlift so that residents with a disability can cross them.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nTypes of footbridges include:\n\nBeam Bridge\nBoardwalk\nClapper bridge\nDuckboards, Timber trackway, Plank road, and Corduroy road\nMoon bridge\nSimple suspension bridge\nSimple truss\nStepping stones\nZig-zag bridgeThe residential-scale footbridges all span a short distance and can be used for a broad range of applications. Complicated engineering is not needed and the footbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.Different types of design footbridges include:\n\nTimber footbridges\nSteel footbridges\nConcrete footbridgeFootbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges; particularly suspension bridges and beam bridges. Some former road bridges have had their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian bridges; examples in the UK include The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, Shropshire, the Old Bridge at Pontypridd and Windsor Bridge at Windsor, Berkshire.\nMost footbridges are equipped with guard rails to reduce the risk of pedestrians falling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a fence or other such barrier to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing projectiles onto the traffic below.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nIt was originally usual for passengers to cross from one railway platform to another by stepping over the tracks, but from the mid-19th century onwards safety demanded the provision of a footbridge (or underpass) at busier places. However, in some quieter areas, crossing the line by walking over the tracks is possible.\n\n\n=== Catwalk ===\nNarrow footbridges or walkways to allow workers access to parts of a structure otherwise difficult to reach are referred as  catwalks or cat walks. Such catwalks are located above a stage (theater catwalk) in a theater, between parts of a building, along the side of a bridge, on the inside of a tunnel, on the outside of any large storage tank in a refinery or elsewhere, etc. The walkway on the outside (top) of a railroad cars such as boxcars, before air brakes came into use, or on top of some covered hopper cars is also called a catwalk. With the exception of those on top of railroad cars, catwalks are equipped with railings or handrails.\n\n\n== In developing countries ==\n\nSince the early 1980s, several charities have developed standardized footbridge designs that are sustainable for use in developing countries. The first charity to develop such designs was Helvetas, located in Zurich, Switzerland. Designs that can be sustainably and efficiently used in developing countries are typically made available to the public gratis.\n\n\n== Long footbridges ==\n\nThe record for the longest footbridge in the world was claimed by the NY State Governor David Paterson in an Oct. 3, 2009 Poughkeepsie Journal article about The Walkway Poughkeepsie Bridge across the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York.  On July 22, 2017, the Champlain Bridge Ice Structure, or \"l'Estacade Champlain\" in French, a bridge built for bicycles and foot traffic only to parallel the Champlain Bridge from Brossard, Quebec west to Nun's Island (L'ile Des Soeurs) & the Island of Montreal, was measured by a calibrated device as being 7,512 feet (2,292 meters) long or 1.4227 miles or 2.292km, starting and ending where the treadway rises above the ground and a pedestrian could access the bridge as close as possible to the St Lawrence River.\nThe Walkway Over The Hudson footbridge was originally built for trains, it was recently restored as a pedestrian walkway.  The footbridge has a total length of 2,063 meters (6,768 feet).  Before it was demolished in 2011, the Hornibrook Bridge which crossed Bramble Bay in Queensland, Australia was longer than the Poughkeepsie Bridge at 2.8 km (1.7 mi).\n\n\n== Other footbridges ==\n\n\n== Advantages ==\nMuch rural travel takes place on local footpaths, tracks and village roads. These provide essential access to water, firewood, farm plots and the classified road network. Communities and/or local government are generally responsible for this infrastructure.\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nPedestrian overpasses over highways or railroads are expensive, especially when elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps will not be able to use the structure. People may prefer to walk across a busy road rather than climb a bridge. It is recommended that overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.Narrow, enclosed structures can result in perceptions of low personal security among users. Wider structures and good lighting can help reduce this.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHow To Build a Footbridge\nTimber Pedestrian Bridge Images",

        "wiki": "The Prairie Dog Central Railway is a heritage railway just outside Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nRegular trips are every Saturday, Sunday and Holiday Monday from May through September, and last almost four hours with one stop in the rural community of Grosse Isle.  Special dinner excursions occur during the season, as well as the Howlin' Halloween Express Trains in October.  Details of the operations can be found by reviewing the schedules.  Private Charters, School Programs and Engineer for a Day are also available.\n\n\n== History ==\nInitiated in 1970 by The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc., the first operations were in July, 1970.  From 1970\u20131974, the train operated out of Charleswood on the now-abandoned Canadian National Cabot Subdivision.  From 1975 to 1996 the train operated out of St. James, immediately west of Polo Park on a now abandoned Canadian National Railways line.\nIn 1999 the station, now a Federal Heritage Site, was moved to its present location at Inkster Junction in Rosser.  The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. purchased the former Oak Point Subdivision from Canadian National Railways in 1999.  Originally constructed between 1905 and 1910 by Mackenzie & Mann for the Canadian Northern Railway, it became part of the cross-Canada Canadian National Railways system in 1923.\nThe subdivision is connected to Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s east-west main line and the portion of the former subdivision used by the Prairie Dog Central extends to about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Warren.  The remainder of the original line has now been abandoned.\n\n\n== Locomotives and Rolling Stock ==\nLocomotive No. 3 is a 4-4-0 built in 1882 by D\u00fcbs and Company in Glasgow, Scotland, for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and later for the City of Winnipeg Hydro. From 2001 to 2009, it underwent a complete frame-off overhaul, including the manufacture of a new boiler. No. 3 is the oldest operating steam locomotive in Canada.\nLocomotive 4138 is a classic EMD GP9 diesel locomotive which was built in November 1958 by Electro-Motive Division of General Motors at La Grange, Illinois for the Grand Trunk Western.  A GP9 model, it has 1,750 horsepower (1,300 kW).\nLocomotive 1685 is also an EMD GP9 diesel locomotive. It was built for the Midland Railway Company of Manitoba by General Motors at their Electromotive Division plant in London, Ontario. Completed in March 1957 with builders number A1091, it was sent directly to Winnipeg to replace Midland Railway Engine Number 1. 1685 served all of its time out of Winnipeg, and only went to the U.S. for heavy maintenance. Locally, 1685 switched in and around Winnipeg on the Midland trackage which served the fruit warehouses while they were serviced by rail.\nDuring the years that 1685 ventured beyond Winnipeg, it regularly traveled to Emerson on the daily freight until that was discontinued. At times it assisted with the former Great Northern passenger train which ran between Minneapolis and Winnipeg. As built, 1685 originally had a steam generator for that purpose. 1685 was not substantially modified over the years. Other than carrying the Burlington Northern paint scheme when BN took over the Midland, and then again when she became BNSF 1685 in 1999, the only major modification was the removal of the steam generator. According to motive power rosters, 1685 was the last GP-9 owned by BNSF.\n\nCoach 103 was built in 1908 by the Pullman Company of Chicago, Illinois for the Keweenaw Central Railway of Calumet, Michigan.  Ceasing operations a few years later it was purchased by the Winnipeg Light and Power Co. in 1920.  It has remained the property of that organization, its successor City of Winnipeg Hydro (now Manitoba Hydro) and is leased to The Vintage Locomotive Society for use with the Prairie Dog Central Railway.\nA \"Combination Coach\" has an area intended for baggage and the remainder is equipped with passenger seats.  The baggage area is used for the train crew, and to accommodate special equipment required for operation.\nThis coach is always located immediately behind the locomotive in the train because Canadian federal operating regulations require that there be a buffer between a steam engine/tender and passenger area.  The baggage compartment area satisfies this regulation.\nIt has been completely restored to its original condition featuring oak paneling, opaque vent windows, pot bellied stove, and lavatory.\nA coach of this type was often used in mixed trains along with boxcars serving the freight and transportation needs of prairie villages.  Coach 103 has a maximum seating capacity of 36 passengers and has been named \"Gordon Younger\" in honor of a founding member of The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc.\nCoach 104 was built in 1906 by the Crossen Coach Company of Cobourg, Ontario for the Canadian Northern Railway, it remained in service until it was sold to the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway (GWWD) in 1954.  The Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. purchased it from GWWD in 1970.\nThis coach has been fully restored and features oak and mahogany panel interior, leaded windows, \u201cpinch gas\u201d light fixtures suspended from the ceiling, separate men's and women's lavatories, a coal stove and a smoking compartment.\nBuilt in 1901 by the Barney and Smith Car Company of Dayton, Ohio for the Canadian Northern Railway, Coach 105 is the oldest of the Prairie Dog Central Railway\u2019s passenger equipment.  It has been fully restored and features an arched interior clerestory roof, inlaid mahogany paneling, a distinctive smoking compartment, separate men's and women's lavatories, and a pot bellied coal stove.\nCoach 106 was constructed in 1913 by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Angus Shops, Quebec. The Vintage Locomotive Society acquired it from the GWWD in 1969 and placed it into service in 1974.  This wooden coach features mahogany paneling with oak accessories, a continuous brass rack above the seats, original stained glass in the vent windows and slider window blinds.\nBuilt in 1911 by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Angus Shops, Quebec, Coach 107 was sold to the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway (GWWD) in 1956, and became the property of the Vintage Locomotive Society Inc. in 1970 through an equipment trade with the GWWD and was placed in service in 1972.\nFeaturing mahogany and oak paneling, suspended \u201cpinch gas\u201d lamps, brass match striker plates at every seat, separate men's and women's lavatories and a pot bellied coal stove, it is always the last coach primarily because it has a full width enclosed vestibule with windows looking back on the track. This area is useful for the Conductor and Trainman when the train is being operated in reverse as it permits a vantage point for safe backward movement under their control and in communication with the Locomotive Engineer.\nThe 2011 schedule lists three locomotives in use.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of heritage railways in Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRailway's website",

        "wiki": "Fort Garry, also known as Upper Fort Garry, was a Hudson's Bay Company trading post at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in what is now downtown Winnipeg. It was established in 1822 on or near the site of the North West Company's Fort Gibraltar established by John Wills in 1810 and destroyed by Governor Semple's men in 1816 during the Pemmican War. Fort Garry was named after Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. It served as the centre of fur trade within the Red River Colony.  In 1826, a severe flood destroyed the fort. It was rebuilt in 1835 by the HBC and named Upper Fort Garry to differentiate it from \"the Lower Fort,\" or Lower Fort Garry, 32 km downriver, which was established in 1831. Throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, Upper Fort Garry played a minor role in the actual trading of furs, but was central to the administration of the HBC and the surrounding settlement. The Council of Assiniboia, the administrative and judicial body of the Red River Colony mainly run by Hudson's Bay Company officials, met at Upper Fort Garry.\nIn 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to surrender its monopoly in the North-West, including Upper Fort Garry. In late 1869 and early 1870, the fort was seized by Louis Riel and his M\u00e9tis followers during the Red River Rebellion. After the Rebellion, the area around the fort continued to grow. In 1873, the city of Winnipeg was established and the name Fort Garry was no longer used. In 1881-1884 the majority of the fort was demolished to straighten Main Street (it was at Main Street and Assiniboine Avenue).\nAlthough only the main gate of the fort remains today, the name \"Fort Garry\" lives on through various institutions and businesses. An area or division of Winnipeg running along the Red River south of the original fort is called Fort Garry.  The hotel beside the fort is called the Fort Garry Hotel, which was originally constructed for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway company. The two streets on either side of the hotel are Fort Street and Garry Street. Many companies have adopted the name, such as Fort Garry Industries and the Fort Garry Brewing Company. The Fort Garry Horse has been a component of the Winnipeg military garrison throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries.\n\n\n== National Historic Site ==\nFort Garry, along with the sites of nearby Forts Rouge and Gibraltar, were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1924, under the name \"Forts Rouge, Garry, and Gibraltar National Historic Site\".  Together, the three sites are illustrative of the evolution of the fur trade in Western Canada, from exploration and expansion westward (Fort Rouge, established in 1738 by the French), to the dominance of the North West Company (Fort Gibraltar, established in 1807) and finally the ascendancy of the Hudson's Bay Company (Fort Garry).  The gate at Fort Garry constitutes the only above-ground remains of this succession of forts.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn 15 June 1938 Canada Post issued 'Fort Garry Gate, Winnipeg', a 20\u00a2 stamp. G\n\n\n== Provincial Heritage Park ==\n\nWork has begun on a project to establish a heritage park in the area surrounding what remains of the Upper Fort Garry. In the spring of 2010, a bill passed the House in the Manitoba Legislature, entitled The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act.\nIn 2007, a development company, Crystal Developers, sought to build an apartment complex next to the fort's original \"footprint\". However, the Friends of Upper Fort Garry, a group dedicated to developing an historical interpretive park at the site, was convened to oppose them. The plan called for an interpretive centre just outside the old fort's walls, and a large surface parking lot that would have been placed closer to the walls than the apartment itself. After a City of Winnipeg-imposed deadline  to raise funds to build a park on the site was nearing, Crystal Developers decided to grant the Friends an additional two years to finish raising the needed funds. Crystal ultimately bowed out of its proposed development plans. Two years later the City of Winnipeg approved the construction by Crystal Developers of a 25-storey apartment tower just west of the original location, on Assiniboine Ave.Enough funds were raised by the Friends to purchase the buildings already on the site of their proposed heritage park, including a Petro-Canada gas station. The only building that was allowed to stay untouched was the current home of the Manitoba Club, which started as an organization in 1874, only one year after the incorporation of Winnipeg. The existing Manitoba Club building was completed in 1905. The historic Fort Garry Hotel across the street was built shortly thereafter, in 1913.\nThe plans for the future heritage park at the site of Upper Fort Garry were officially unveiled in May 2010.From the Hansard Records of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, dated Monday, June 14, 2010, it is clear that the boundaries of the proposed Upper Fort Garry Provincial Heritage Park, described in Bill 27\u2013The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act then under consideration, would not include the Manitoba Club building. In the meeting referenced above, Mr. Jerry Gray (Friends of Upper Fort Garry), referring to the future park boundaries, states that the property is \"bordered by Main Street on the east side, Assiniboine on the south side and Fort Street on the west side and then goes up to the back where the gate property is.\" Evidently, the Manitoba Club property on Broadway is excluded from the proposed heritage park, aside from being located on the same city block. According to the records of the Thirty-Ninth Legislature, Bill 27 received Royal Assent on June 17, 2010, by Proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor Philip S. Lee.The park opened to the public on August 6, 2015, with development still to come.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCouncil of Keewatin\nFort Rouge (fortification)\nHistory of Winnipeg\nTemporary North-West Council\nCoat of arms of Winnipeg\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nFriends of Upper Fort Garry\nThe Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act\nManitoba Historical Maps, Images and Maps of Fort Garry\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Forks (French: La Fourche) is a historic site, meeting place and green space in Downtown Winnipeg located at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine River. \nThe Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity. The site's 5.5-hectare (14-acre; 0.021 sq mi) grounds are open year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 6,000 years ago ===\nNumerous archaeological digs have shown that early Aboriginal groups arrived at The Forks site around 6,000 years ago. The digs conducted between 1989 and 1994 discovered several Aboriginal camps. Artifacts related to the bison hunt and fishing were unearthed. Evidence showed that Nakoda (Assiniboins), Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) and Sioux (Dakota) visited the site. Seasonal migration routes from northern forests to southern plains featured the Forks area as a rest stop, and the location became a key transcontinental trade link.The Assiniboine River has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River.\n\n\n=== 1734\u20131760 ===\nEuropean fur traders arrived at the site and initiated trade with the local peoples, using the Assiniboine people as fur trade middlemen.\n\n\n=== 1738\u20131880 ===\nEuropeans arrived by canoe in 1738. La V\u00e9rendrye erected Fort Rouge, the first of a long line of forts and trading posts erected in the area. The Red River Colony and the forts were all established near The Forks. The area remained the hub of the fur trade up until the 1880s. At that time, grain production became Western Canada\u2019s principal industry and the main transportation for that industry was rail rather than waterways.During the smallpox epidemics of 1781\u20131782, over half of the area's aboriginal population died.  At this time over 1,000 Aboriginal men, women, and children were buried in The Old Aboriginal Graveyard at The Forks.From 1760 to 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company competed for furs. Both companies used The Forks to store and ship supplies and furs. By 1821, competing fur companies were amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== 1886\u20131923 ===\nThe rail yards of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway were dominant facets of the Forks site, and this era is responsible for some of the buildings still standing at The Forks.The Forks Market was formed by joining together the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stable and the Great Northern Railway stable and Johnston Terminal was originally known as the National Cartage Building.The Manitoba Children\u2019s Museum is housed in what used to be the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company\u2019s Buildings and Bridges (B & B) Buildings. Union Station is still in operation.\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131920 ===\nAcross the Prairies the Canadian government began actively promoting immigration, settlement and railway development in the late 1800s. The Canadian government erected two immigration sheds at The Forks, each accommodating up to 500 people.\n\n\n=== The Forks today ===\n\nSince its designation in 1989, The Forks has contained public space for celebrations and recreation, an interpretive park, revitalized historic and new buildings containing shops and restaurants, as well as a skateboard park and historic port. The Forks attracts over four million visitors each year.\n\n\n== The Forks Market ==\n\nBeginning as two adjacent stables for competing rail companies, the horse stalls were joined together by a courtyard and bridges and became what is now known as The Forks Market.The Forks Market features a six storey tower with viewing platform, which is accessible by stairs or elevator and features interpretive panels with information on the site's history.\nThe market also comprises two storeys of vendors selling everything from fresh fruit, bread, meat, and wine to cigars and aromatherapy products to crafts and artworks from 300 local and Canadian artisans.In mid-2016, the Forks completed a $2.5-million renovation of the food hall into a feature called The Common, including a new beer and wine kiosk.\n\n\n== Johnston Terminal ==\n\nAcross the courtyard from the Forks Market is the four-storey Johnston Terminal building. Originally constructed in 1930, the terminal was a warehouse and freight-forwarding facility erected by Carter-Halls-Aldinger Company, and cost an estimated $134,700. After a substantial addition in 1930, the warehouse was at the time one of the largest in Winnipeg, containing over 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq ft) of usable space. It was occupied by National Storage and Cartage until 1961, and was leased to the Johnston National Cartage Company for the next 15 years.  Vacated in 1977, the building was unoccupied until the redevelopment of the site into The Forks. The original developers, Artis REIT, continue to own and manage Johnston Terminal. \nThe building is now home to a variety of specialty boutiques and stores, offices, a caf\u00e9, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. The basement of the building hosts the Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, which features over 30 consigners and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new merchandise brought in daily.\n\n\n== Travel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre ==\nTravel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre \u2013 Forks Location is the visitor information centre for Manitoba, offering travel counseling and trip planning services. The centre also acts as a meeting point for the \"6,000 Years in 60 Minutes!\" Parks Canada interpretive program offered throughout the summer months.\n\n\n== Manitoba Children's Museum ==\n\nLocated next to the Oodena Celebration Circle, the Manitoba Children's Museum is a non-profit, charitable children's museum featuring twelve permanent galleries. Originally opened at a different location in 1986, the museum's moved to its current building at the Forks in 1994. The museum is now housed in the former Kinsmen Building, which is the oldest surviving train repair facility in Manitoba, having been built in 1889.The museum underwent $10 million in renovations in 2011, including the addition of the Buhler Welcome Centre.\n\n\n== Manitoba Theatre for Young People ==\n\nThe Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults, located at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg. The location provides 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2) of space for the theatre to use towards its missions of producing entertaining professional theatre, providing training in theatre and portraying the experience of Canadian children.MTYP's Theatre School offers Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions, as well as Spring break and Summer camps, including classes for children as young as three years old. MTYP offers free acting, performing and film training classes to Winnipeg's Aboriginal youth between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\n== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ==\n\nThe Forks is the location of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (the first national museum outside of Ottawa). Its construction was completed in 2014.\nThe site for the museum is one of archaeological importance relating to First Nations history.\n\n\n== Inn at the Forks ==\n\nInn at the Forks is a five storey hotel located at the Forks. It has 117 guest rooms and suites, meeting and reception space for up to 200 people, fitness facilities, and features The Current Restaurant & Lounge and Riverstone Spa. The hotel features natural slate floors in the main lobby, glass vanities in the suite washrooms, heated floors, and a water wall in the spa.The Inn at the Forks project was the first Canadian application of the \u201cRedi-Maid\u201d system that links ensuite occupancy sensors, lighting and mechanical system controls to staff PDAs with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency. The hotel was completed with a construction cost of $16 million in May 2004.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Rail Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Rail Museum is located at the historic Union Station adjacent to the Forks. It is home to the Countess of Dufferin steam locomotive, the first locomotive to enter Western Canada.\n\n\n== Outdoor features ==\nThe Forks features numerous outdoor facilities, sculptures, and landscape features open to the public.\n\n\n=== Arctic Glacier Winter Park ===\n\nDuring winter, the following skating rinks, trails and snow park structures are erected at the Forks.\nThe Plaza Skating Rink\nAn Olympic-sized Skating Rink\nRink under Scotiabank Stage\n1.2 km of skating trails\nThe Snowboard Fun Park\nThe Toboggan Run\nIn January 2008, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized The Forks as the home of the longest skating rink in the world. The 8.54-kilometre-long Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail on the Assiniboine River and the Red River is almost 1 kilometer longer than the previous record-holding rink. The 7.8-kilometre long rink on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Ontario had lost its World Record title which it had held since 1971. Then in 2008 the rivers beat their own record which made the longest rink go to about 9.3-kilometres. The Rideau Canal still held the record for the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\". In 2013 the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail lost its record to the Lake Windermere Whiteway at Invermere, British Columbia, Canada.The length of the skating trail at The Forks changes each year, depending on river and ice conditions, although a concerted effort is made to make it as long as possible. In the winter of 2010/2011, conditions on The Assiniboine River made it impossible to safely create skating westward, so the path extended instead south on the Red River. Essentially, the water level and the weather at the time of freeze-up will impact the way the ice forms (see frazil ice, for example), how stable it will be, and how smoothly it can be made for skating. Much of the local river ice in Winnipeg in the winter of 2010/2011 was too rough to form a skating surface. There is also a skating trail made overland which is not impacted by river conditions. There are also walking and ski trails running parallel to the skating trail.\nWarming Huts: An Art + Architecture Competition on Ice is an open competition endorsed by the Manitoba Association of Architects. Started in 2010, the first iteration of the competition saw five local architects building outdoor structures to protect people from winter weather. In 2011, competition was opened up to international participants and included work by Frank Gehry's firm Gehry Partners. The competition has been awarded a Downtown Merit Award from the International Downtown Association. In January of each year, competition winners travel to Winnipeg for a week to build their warming huts, which are then relocated onto the frozen river for visitors to use. Warming huts are available until the end of the skating season. \n\n\n=== Assiniboine Riverwalk ===\n\nThe Assiniboine Riverwalk follows along the riverbanks from underneath Esplanade Riel to the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building.The Riverwalk is often closed due to river flooding in springtime. From the construction of the walkway to the summer of 2011, the walkway has been submerged beyond access for part of the summer for 16 out of 21 years.\n\n\n=== Balance of Spirit Within ===\n\"Balance of Spirit Within\" is a granite stone sculpture weighing approximately 10 tonnes, and is located on the north side of the Forks Historic Rail Bridge.\n\n\n=== Broadway Promenade ===\nThe Broadway Promenade is a pedestrian walkway connecting the Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge to Union Station and Broadway Avenue. Designed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the design incorporates two pathways which cross the site.  One pathway re-established the historic Broadway/Provencher Boulevard connection, and the other is a winding pathway representing pre-European contact era.\n\n\n=== Busk Stops ===\nThere are often buskers in and around the Forks. Buskers perform at stations known as \"Busk Stops\". They are paid by donation, but are prohibited from suggesting donation amounts or requesting contributions. There is an annual competition called the \"Scotiabank Busker's Festival\" at which it is decided who will be allowed to Busk.\n\n\n=== Esplanade Riel ===\n\nNamed in honor of Louis Riel,  Esplanade Riel is a pedestrian-only side-spar cable-stayed bridge which spans the Red River connecting downtown Winnipeg with St. Boniface, and it is paired with a vehicular bridge, the Provencher Bridge.\nThe Esplanade Riel is the only bridge with a restaurant in North America, and since July 2015 is occupied by Mon Ami Louis.  Former leasees include Salisbury House, a local Winnipeg chain restaurant, and Chez Sophie.\n\n\n=== Festival Park and Scotiabank Stage ===\nThe Scotiabank Stage is an outdoor stage with adjoining greenspace, built along the Broadway Promenade.In 2012, the signature events at the stage included Winnipeg's Pride Parade festival, Aboriginal Day Live hosted by APTN, Canada Day activities and the Folklorama Kick-Off.\n\n\n=== Flood markers ===\nThe posts on the canopy between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands on them to commemorate the peak water levels of major floods. Starting from the bottom of the posts, the bottom marker represents the 1950 flood, the middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 floods, and the top the flood of 1826. The flood line markers on one of the posts have historic plaques with information on the floods they represent.\n\n\n=== The Forks Historic Port ===\n\nPositioned along the Assiniboine Riverwalk, the historic port offers river vessel docking and rental, as well as access to the Splash Dash Water Bus.During times of flooding Splash Dash Water Bus employs a moveable ramp and floating dock system that allows it to operate in high water conditions.\n\n\n=== The Forks Market Plaza ===\nLocated directly in between the Forks Market, and Johnston Terminal, the Forks Market Plaza features fountains, canopies, dancing programs, several open performance spaces and patios.In the winter, the Plaza is home to an artificially cooled skating rink, under a canopy and lights.\n\n\n=== The Forks National Historic Site of Canada ===\nThe Forks National Historic Site of Canada is a 9.0 acre (3.63 hectare) park dedicated to \"preserving and presenting the 6,000-year history of human presence and activity at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers\", and is operated by Parks Canada.\nThe site features interpretive exhibits, sculptures, year-round walking trails, a dock, a canoe beach, a native prairie garden and a riverside amphitheatre for performances and events. Walking tours and presentations are offered throughout the summer.\n\n\n=== Historic Rail Bridge ===\nBuilt in 1888, the rail bridge was abandoned and eventually converted into a lighted crossing for pedestrians, cyclists and skaters.The mural on the side of the rail bridge is entitled \"Jackson Beardy \u2014 Woodlands Group of Seven Tribute\", and was painted in 2006 for Graffiti Gallery's Winnipeg International Mural Festival. The 30 foot wide and 20 foot tall mural pays tribute to Cree artist Jackson Beardy as well as the other members of the Indian Group of Seven.\n\n\n=== Oodena Celebration Circle ===\n\nOodena Celebration Circle is a natural shallow amphitheatre located between Johnston's Terminal, the Manitoba Children's Museum, and the Red River Riverwalk. \"Oodena\" is Cree for \"centre of the city\". Commissioned in 1993, the site was designed by the firm of Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm. The location features sculptures, a sundial, interpretive signage, a naked eye observatory and a ceremonial fire pit.The circular amphitheatre is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep. The 3 metres (9.8 ft) excavation for the site unearthed what is referred to by local archaeologists as \u201cthe archaic horizon\u201d, a 3,000-year-old layer of soil rich in artifacts.There are 8 unique steel armatures that rest on cobblestone formations surrounding the bowl.  Each armature points at a specific constellation, according to dates and times indicated on the panels surrounding the central stage.  Sighting rings on the armatures identify specific stars within the constellations. The supporting cobblestone formations bear inscriptions of various legends about the stars their armatures focus upon. The amphitheatre marks the vernal and autumnal equinox and the summer and winter solstices. \"The south armature features a shadow rod that casts solstice shadows on ground markers, the west armature is fitted with a wind sculpture, and the northeast armature features an aeolian harp.\" (Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm \u2013 Oodena Celebration Circle)The site has been used as a meeting grounds for such varied events as \"No Stone Unturned\", a free concert in honour of Manitoba's missing and murdered women, as well as the 2011 opening night location for THIN AIR, the Winnipeg International Writers Festival and as the meeting location for Winnipeg's Zombie Walk 2012.\n\n\n=== Pan Am Games Monument ===\n\nThe Forks is home to the 1999 Pan Am Games Monument. Located beside the Inn at the Forks, the monument recognizes the governments, companies and individuals who supported the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The monument served as the flame cauldron for the games.The 1999 Pan Am Games mainstage concerts were held at the Scotiabank Stage and Festival Park.\n\n\n=== Peace Meeting Site ===\nThe \"Peace Meeting Site\" is a landscaped resting area along the Broadway Promenade, featuring Aboriginal and European elements, notable for having two gigantic Adirondack chairs.\n\n\n=== Prairie Garden ===\nThe Forks has a Prairie Garden, which is a natural wild garden with over 10,000 plants in over 150 native plant species, including 38 prairie plants such as prairie crocus, wild iris, bergamot, purple prairie clover and wild columbine.\n\n\n=== Public Orchard ===\nIn collaboration with Winnipeg-CORE, the public orchard at The Forks contains 61 fruit trees including apple, apricot, cherry, pear, and plum, which the public can pick to eat from when the fruit is ripe. There are as many as 75 fruit bearing shrubs packed with all types of berries to pick from during the summer days.\nThere are also many education sessions through Winnipeg-CORE that are open to the public, as part of The Fork's Target Zero initiative.\n\n\n=== Rail cars ===\n\nJust outside The Forks Market are two completely restored turn of the century rail cars. One car is for display, while the other is home to \"Sugar Mountain Express\", a candy store.\n\n\n=== Skatepark ===\n\nOfficially opened 30 June 2006, \"The Plaza\" is the largest urban skate plaza and bowl complex in Canada. Announced in 2005, it was built with money donated from the J.W. Burns Family Foundation. The skatepark includes a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, and an 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) 'bowl complex'.The design features 'skateable' artwork, and is built to tolerate the regular use and enjoyment of skateboarders and cyclists. The park was also designed to integrate into the urban architecture of the city. It was designed by Landscape Architecture firm: van der Zalm + associates inc. of Vancouver, BC with key team members, New Line Skateparks and Scatliff Miller Murray as the local landscape architects.\"Skate Patrol\" are experienced skateboarder staff members that tour the park from dawn to dusk to educate skaters on the park's etiquette.In winter, this area features a small snowboarding facility.In 2006, the park was visited by professional skateboarder Tony Hawk to shoot scenes for his movie release Secret Skatepark Tour 3.\n\n\n=== Variety Heritage Adventure Playground ===\nThe Variety Heritage Adventure Playground is an educational play structure for children, featuring water park elements.\n\n\n=== Wall Through Time ===\n\n\"Wall Through Time\" is a sculpture depicting the history of the Forks, which features two bronze shells and a limestone centrepiece.

        "wiki": "Winnie-the-Pooh, also called Pooh Bear and Pooh, is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne.\nThe first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.\nThe Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list.In 1961, Walt Disney Productions licensed certain film and other rights of Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories from the estate of A. A. Milne and the licensing agent Stephen Slesinger.Inc. and adapted the Pooh stories, using the unhyphenated name \"Winnie the Pooh\", into a series of features that would eventually become one of its most successful franchises.\nIn popular film adaptations, Pooh has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith and Jim Cummings in English, and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nA. A. Milne named the character Winnie-the-Pooh after a teddy bear owned by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, on whom the character Christopher Robin was based. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys \u2013 Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, and Tigger \u2013 were incorporated into Milne's stories. Two more characters, Owl and Rabbit, were created by Milne's imagination, while Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin's toy bear is on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.\n\nChristopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo, and \"Pooh\", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear \"Winnie\" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \"Winnie\" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much-loved attraction there. Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.\n\nIn the first chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh, Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often called simply \"Pooh\":\n\nBut his arms were so stiff ... they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think \u2013 but I am not sure \u2013 that that is why he is always called Pooh.\nThe American writer William Safire surmised that the Milnes' invention of the name \"Winnie the Pooh\" may have also been influenced by the haughty character Pooh-Bah in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (1885).\n\n\n=== Ashdown Forest: the setting for the stories ===\nThe Winnie-the-Pooh stories are set in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, England. The forest is an area of tranquil open heathland on the highest sandy ridges of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty situated 30 miles (50 km) south-east of London. In 1925 Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield. According to Christopher Milne, while his father continued to live in London \"...the four of us \u2013 he, his wife, his son and his son's nanny \u2013 would pile into a large blue, chauffeur-driven Fiat and travel down every Saturday morning and back again every Monday afternoon. And we would spend a whole glorious month there in the spring and two months in the summer.\" From the front lawn the family had a view across a meadow to a line of alders that fringed the River Medway, beyond which the ground rose through more trees until finally \"above them, in the faraway distance, crowning the view, was a bare hilltop. In the centre of this hilltop was a clump of pines.\" Most of his father's visits to the forest at that time were, he noted, family expeditions on foot \"to make yet another attempt to count the pine trees on Gill's Lap or to search for the marsh gentian\". Christopher added that, inspired by Ashdown Forest, his father had made it \"the setting for two of his books, finishing the second little over three years after his arrival\".Many locations in the stories can be associated with real places in and around the forest. As Christopher Milne wrote in his autobiography: \"Pooh\u2019s forest and Ashdown Forest are identical\". For example, the fictional \"Hundred Acre Wood\" was in reality Five Hundred Acre Wood; Galleon's Leap was inspired by the prominent hilltop of Gill's Lap, while a clump of trees just north of Gill's Lap became Christopher Robin's The Enchanted Place, because no-one had ever been able to count whether there were 63 or 64 trees in the circle.The landscapes depicted in E. H. Shepard's illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh books were directly inspired by the distinctive landscape of Ashdown Forest, with its high, open heathlands of heather, gorse, bracken and silver birch, punctuated by hilltop clumps of pine trees. Many of Shepard's illustrations can be matched to actual views, allowing for a degree of artistic licence. Shepard's sketches of pine trees and other forest scenes are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.The game of Poohsticks was originally played by Christopher Milne on the wooden footbridge, across the Millbrook, Posingford Wood, close to Cotchford Farm. It is now a tourist attraction, and it has become traditional to play the game there using sticks gathered in the nearby woodland. When the footbridge had to be replaced in 1999, the architect used as a main source drawings by Shepard in the books, which differ a little from the original structure.\n\n\n=== First publication ===\n Christopher Robin's teddy bear, Edward, made his character d\u00e9but in A. A. Milne's poem, \"Teddy Bear\", in the edition of 13 February 1924 of Punch (E. H. Shepard had also included a similar bear in a cartoon published in Punch the previous week), and the same poem was published in Milne's book of children's verse When We Were Very Young (6 November 1924). Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name on 24 December 1925, in a Christmas story commissioned and published by the London newspaper The Evening News. It was illustrated by J. H. Dowd.The first collection of Pooh stories appeared in the book Winnie-the-Pooh. The Evening News Christmas story reappeared as the first chapter of the book. At the beginning, it explained that Pooh was in fact Christopher Robin's Edward Bear, who had been renamed by the boy. He was renamed after an American black bear at London Zoo called Winnie who got her name from the fact that her owner had come from Winnipeg, Canada. The book was published in October 1926 by the publisher of Milne's earlier children's work, Methuen, in England, E. P. Dutton in the United States, and McClelland & Stewart in Canada.\n\n\n=== Character ===\nIn the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is \"a bear of very little brain\", Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense. These include riding in Christopher Robin's umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood, discovering \"the North Pole\" by picking it up to help fish Roo out of the river, inventing the game of Poohsticks, and getting Eeyore out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank.\nPooh is also a talented poet and the stories are frequently punctuated by his poems and \"hums\". Although he is humble about his slow-wittedness, he is comfortable with his creative gifts. When Owl's house blows down in a windstorm, trapping Pooh, Piglet and Owl inside, Pooh encourages Piglet (the only one small enough to do so) to escape and rescue them all by promising that \"a respectful Pooh song\" will be written about Piglet's feat. Later, Pooh muses about the creative process as he composes the song.\nPooh is very fond of food, particularly \"hunny\", but also condensed milk and other items. When he visits friends, his desire to be offered a snack is in conflict with the impoliteness of asking too directly. Though intent on giving Eeyore a pot of honey for his birthday, Pooh could not resist eating it on his way to deliver the present and so instead gives Eeyore \"a useful pot to put things in\". When he and Piglet are lost in the forest during Rabbit's attempt to \"unbounce\" Tigger, Pooh finds his way home by following the \"call\" of the honeypots from his house. Pooh makes it a habit to have \"a little something\" around 11:00 in the morning. As the clock in his house \"stopped at five minutes to eleven some weeks ago,\" any time can be Pooh's snack time.\nPooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, his closest friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses to spend his time with one or both of them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or an audience for his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means he goes out of his way to be friendly to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.\n\n\n=== Sequel ===\nAn authorised sequel Return to the Hundred Acre Wood was published on 5 October 2009. The author, David Benedictus, has developed, but not changed, Milne's characterisations. The illustrations, by Mark Burgess, are in the style of Shepard.Another authorised sequel, Winnie-the-Pooh: The Best Bear in All the World, was published by Egmont in 2016. The sequel consists of four short stories by four leading children's authors, Kate Saunders, Brian Sibley, Paul Bright and Jeanne Willis. Illustrations are by Mark Burgess. The Best Bear in All The World sees the introduction of a new character, Penguin, which was inspired by a long-lost photograph of Milne and his son Christopher with a toy penguin. A further special story, Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen, was published in 2016 to mark the 90th anniversary of Milne's creation and the 90th birthday of Elizabeth II. It sees Winnie the Pooh meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\n\n\n=== Stephen Slesinger ===\nOn 6 January 1930, Stephen Slesinger purchased U.S. and Canadian merchandising, television, recording and other trade rights to the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" works from Milne for a $1,000 advance and 66% of Slesinger's income, creating the modern licensing industry. By November 1931, Pooh was a $50 million-a-year business. Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, U.S. radio broadcast (NBC), animation and motion picture film.\n\n\n=== Red shirt Pooh ===\nThe first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now-familiar red shirt and featured on an RCA Victor picture record. Parker Brothers introduced A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh Game in 1933, again with Pooh in his red shirt. In the 1940s, Agnes Brush created the first plush dolls with Pooh in his red shirt. Shepard had drawn Pooh with a shirt as early as the first book Winnie-The-Pooh, which was subsequently coloured red in later coloured editions.\n\n\n=== Disney ownership era (1966\u2013present) ===\n\nAfter Slesinger's death in 1953, his wife, Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, continued developing the character herself. In 1961, she licensed rights to Walt Disney Productions in exchange for royalties in the first of two agreements between Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and Disney. The same year, A. A. Milne's widow, Daphne Milne, also licensed certain rights, including motion picture rights, to Disney.\nSince 1966, Disney has released numerous animated productions starring Winnie the Pooh and related characters, starting with the theatrical featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. This was followed by Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968) and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974). These three featurettes were combined into a feature-length movie, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, in 1977. A fourth featurette, Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore, was released in 1983.\nA new series of Winnie the Pooh theatrical feature-length films launched in the 2000s, with The Tigger Movie (2000), Piglet's Big Movie (2003), Pooh's Heffalump Movie (2005), and Winnie the Pooh (2011).\nDisney has also produced television series based on the franchise, including Welcome to Pooh Corner (Disney Channel, 1983\u20131986), The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (ABC, 1988\u20131991), The Book of Pooh (Playhouse Disney, 2001\u20132003), and My Friends Tigger & Pooh (Playhouse Disney, 2007\u20132010).\n\n\n=== Merchandising revenue dispute ===\nPooh videos, soft toys and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from Beanie and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh, Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E. H. Shepard's illustrations.\nIn 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name. Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents, the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger's investigator had rummaged through Disney's garbage to retrieve the discarded evidence. Slesinger appealed the termination and, on 26 September 2007, a three-judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal.After the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, Clare Milne, Christopher Robin Milne's daughter, attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger, Inc. After a series of legal hearings, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the U.S. District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger, Inc., as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 26 June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit.On 19 February 2007, Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their \"misguided claims\" to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger, Inc. were unjustified, but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009, again from Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademarks and copyrights to Disney, although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters. Both parties have expressed satisfaction with the outcome.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nWinnie-the-Pooh at the Guild Theater, Sue Hastings Marionettes, 1931\nWinnie-the-Pooh, a play in three acts, dramatized by Kristin Sergel, Dramatic Publishing Company, 1957\nWinnie-the-Pooh, a musical comedy in two acts, lyrics by A.

Hodges), was an item in the programme For the Children, broadcast by stations 2LO and 5XX on 23 March 1926.\nPooh made his U.S. radio debut on 10 November 1932, when he was broadcast to 40,000 schools by The American School of the Air, the educational division of the Columbia Broadcasting System.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n2017: Goodbye Christopher Robin, a British drama film exploring the creation of Winnie-the-Pooh by A.A. Milne, with Domhnall Gleeson playing Christopher Robin\n\n\n==== Soviet adaptation ====\n\nIn the Soviet Union, three Winnie-the-Pooh, (transcribed in Russian as \"Vinni Pukh\") (Russian language: \u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445) stories were made into a celebrated trilogy of short films by Soyuzmultfilm (directed by Fyodor Khitruk) from 1969 to 1972, after being granted permission by Disney to make their own adaptation in a gesture of Cold War d\u00e9tente.\n\u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445 (Winnie-the-Pooh, 1969) \u2013 based on chapter 1\n\u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445 \u0438\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 (Winnie-the-Pooh Pays a Visit, 1971) \u2013 based on chapter 2\n\u0412\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438-\u041f\u0443\u0445 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442 (Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, 1972) \u2013 based on chapters 4 and 6.The films used Boris Zakhoder's translation of the book. Pooh was voiced by Yevgeny Leonov. Unlike in the Disney adaptations, the animators did not base their depictions of the characters on Shepard's illustrations, instead creating a different look. The Soviet adaptations made extensive use of Milne's original text and often bring out aspects of Milne's characters' personalities not used in the Disney adaptations.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n1960: Shirley Temple's Storybook on NBC: Winnie-the-Pooh\u2013 a version for marionettes, designed, made, and operated by Bil and Cora Baird. Pooh was voiced by Franz Fazakas.\nDuring the 1970s, the BBC children's television show Jackanory serialised the two books, which were read by Willie Rushton.\n\n\n=== Disney adaptations ===\n\n\n==== Theatrical shorts ====\n1966: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\n1968: Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\n1974: Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too\n1981: Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons\n1983: Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\n\n\n==== Theatrical feature films ====\n1977: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (compilation of Honey Tree, Blustery Day, and Tigger Too)\n2000: The Tigger Movie\n2003: Piglet's Big Movie\n2005: Pooh's Heffalump Movie\n2011: Winnie the Pooh\n2018: Christopher Robin\n\n\n==== Television shows ====\nWelcome to Pooh Corner (*) (Disney Channel, 1983\u20131986)\nThe New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (ABC, 1988\u20131991)\nThe Book of Pooh (*) (Disney Channel (Playhouse Disney), 2001\u20132003)\nMy Friends Tigger & Pooh (Disney Channel (Playhouse Disney), 2007\u20132010)\nMini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (Disney Junior, 2011\u20132014)Magical World of Winnie the Pooh\n(Note: These are episodes from The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh)\n(*): Puppet/live-action show\n\n\n==== Holiday TV specials ====\n1991: Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too, included in A Very Merry Pooh Year\n1996: Boo to You Too!

Benjamin Hoff used Milne's characters in The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet to explain Taoism. Similarly, Frederick Crews wrote essays about the Pooh books in abstruse academic jargon in The Pooh Perplex and Postmodern Pooh to satirise a range of philosophical approaches. Pooh and the Philosophers by John T. Williams uses Winnie the Pooh as a backdrop to illustrate the works of philosophers, including Descartes, Kant, Plato and Nietzsche. \"Epic Pooh\" is a 1978 essay by Michael Moorcock that compares much fantasy writing to A.A. Milne's as work intended to comfort, not challenge.\nOne of the best known characters in British children's literature, a 2011 poll saw Winnie the Pooh voted onto the list of icons of England. Forbes magazine ranked Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002, with merchandising products alone generating more than $5.9 billion that year. In 2005, Pooh generated $6 billion, a figure surpassed by only Mickey Mouse. In 2006, Pooh received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, marking the 80th birthday of Milne's creation. The bear is such a popular character in Poland that a Warsaw street is named for him, Ulica Kubusia Puchatka. There is also a street named after him in Budapest (Micimack\u00f3 utca).In music, Kenny Loggins wrote the song \"House at Pooh Corner\", which was originally recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Loggins later rewrote the song as \"Return to Pooh Corner\", featuring on the album of the same name in 1991. In Italy, a pop band took their name from Winnie, and were titled Pooh. In Estonia there is a punk/metal band called Winny Puhh.\nIn the \"sport\" of Poohsticks, competitors drop sticks into a stream from a bridge and then wait to see whose stick will cross the finish line first. Though it began as a game played by Pooh and his friends in the book The House at Pooh Corner and later in the films, it has crossed over into the real world: a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire each year. Ashdown Forest in England where the Pooh stories are set is a popular tourist attraction, and includes the wooden Pooh Bridge where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks. The Oxford University Winnie the Pooh Society was founded by undergraduates in 1982.\nFrom December 2017 to April 2018, the V&A hosted the exhibition Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic. On exhibit were teddy bears that had not been on diplay for some 40 years because they were so fragile.\n\n\n== Censorship in China ==\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, images of Pooh were censored from social media websites in mid-2017, when internet memes comparing Chinese Paramount leader and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping to (Disney's version of) Pooh became popular. The 2018 film Christopher Robin was also denied a Chinese release.\nWhen Xi visited the Philippines, protestors posted images of Pooh on social media. Other politicians have been compared to Winnie-the-Pooh characters alongside Xi, including Barack Obama as Tigger, Carrie Lam, Rodrigo Duterte and Peng Liyuan as Piglet, and Fernando Chui and Shinzo Abe as Eeyore.Pooh's Chinese name (Chinese: \u5c0f\u718a\u7ef4\u5c3c; lit.: 'little bear Winnie') has been censored from video games such as World of Warcraft, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Arena of Valor, and Devotion. Images of Pooh in Kingdom Hearts III were also blurred out.Despite the ban, two Winnie the Pooh-themed rides appear in Disneyland Shanghai.In October 2019, Pooh was featured in the South Park episode \"Band in China\" because of his alleged resemblance with Xi. In the episode, Pooh is brutally killed by Randy Marsh. South Park was banned in China as a result of the episode.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh at Curlie\nThe original bear, with A. A.

          "Hard to identify with free these days but besides the city zoo, there is a lot of things to do here that costs zero. Everything from flower gardens, art, movies and even concerts. A city gem for all ages",

          "This visit proved to have many highlights. Large group of us -5 adults and 5 grandchildren set off at 9:00 am on a bright crisp morning. We were showcasing our world class Zoo to my son and family from Nelson BC. We were treated to so many animals wandering close to the bars so",
          "We decided to go check out the new Polar Bear Exhibit at the Zoo and we weren't disappointed. You can stand underneath the water tunnel and watch the young rehabilitated Polar Bears frolicking in the water. We also enjoyed the Dinosaurs Alive featuring life like dinosaurs that",
          "Great place for the intire family to enjoy the day. Either in summer or winter. Summer activities such as the children's dr good bear event or just have a picnic. In winter you can go skate on the pond or go tobogganing down the slides!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Norbert (French: Saint-Norbert) is a bilingual (French and English) neighbourhood in the southernmost part of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. While outside the Perimeter Highway, (the orbital road that surrounds most of Winnipeg), it is still part of the city. At the 2016 Census, the population of St. Norbert is 5,850. \nEach summer, the community is home to the St. Norbert Farmers' Market, drawing large crowds from Winnipeg and the surrounding area. Other attractions include the St. Norbert Provincial Heritage Park, and the St. Norbert Arts and Cultural Centre. St. Norbert is the closest community to the Red River Floodway gates.\nSt. Norbert is also the name of a much bigger city ward in Winnipeg, which includes much of the Fort Garry South neighbourhood cluster and a small part of St. Vital. It is represented by a member of Winnipeg City Council.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original inhabitants of what is now St. Norbert were First Nations peoples, including the Assiniboine, the Cree\nand the Ojibwe, who were drawn to this region because of its hunting and fishing opportunities. The community bordered on two rivers \u2013 the Red and La Salle \u2013 and a bison trail ran from the south bank of the La Salle River to bison hunting grounds nearly 50 kilometres away.\nSt. Norbert\u2019s prime location along major trade and transportation routes proved advantageous. With the arrival of the French, the Scots, and other Europeans, and with the growth of the M\u00e9tis population, St. Norbert developed into a permanent community. The Pembina Trail (now Pembina Highway) passed through St. Norbert as it routed travellers from Upper Fort Garry (present day downtown Winnipeg, and the primary southern outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company) to St. Paul, Minnesota \u2013 the nearest railhead.\nThe settlement was elevated to the status of parish in 1857 and given the name St. Norbert in honour of the first bishop\nof St. Boniface, Bishop Joseph-Norbert Provencher. The first parish priest, Father Jean-Marie Lestanc, was followed by Father Charles Mestre in 1860, then by Father No\u00ebl-Joseph Ritchot in 1862.\nOn October 19, 1869, a public meeting was held at St. Norbert Roman Catholic Church. At that meeting, the Comite national des M\u00e9tis was formed, with Louis Riel as secretary. The first act of the committee was an erection of a barrier across the Pembina Trail to keep out unwanted emissaries of the Canadian Government.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Asile Ritchot ===\n\nVisible from Pembina highway, one of the most recognizable landmarks in St. Norbert is a large three-story building marked by a huge centre dome. Begun in the 1870s, the first building on the site was the home of politician and businessman Monsieur Joseph Lemay.  The building eventually came into the possession of the local church, and in 1903, Father No\u00ebl-Joseph Ritchot arranged the donation of the building and 80 acres (320,000 m2) of surrounding land to les Soeurs de Misericorde (Sisters of Mercy). The Sisters called the building Asile Ritchot and operated an orphanage there from 1904 to 1948. In 1911, a large expansion was begun. The new brick building was three stories tall, and featured the landmark centre dome. \nWhen Asile Ritchot closed its doors in 1948, the building was taken over by the Oblate Fathers, and used as a seminary. In 1970, the X-Kalay foundation (now called the Behavioral Health Foundation) took over the building and currently operates a successful halfway house for the support and rehabilitation of individuals with drug or alcohol issues.\n\n\n=== Trappist monastery ===\nAnother architectural landmark in St. Norbert is the former Trappist monastery, now an arts and cultural centre. In 1891, the Abbot of Bellefontaine in France agreed to establish a Trappist monastery on a secluded piece of parish land along the La Salle River, and monks arrived in St. Norbert in 1892. The order was dedicated to a life of prayer and hard work, following the basic tenets of St. Benedict \u2013 charity, obedience, and humility. The monks succeeded in building a large and prosperous agricultural operation complete with a sawmill, forge, apiary, cheese house, bakery and greenhouses. Between 30 and 45 monks inhabited the monastery at any given time. By 1975, St. Norbert had become a much more urban area, and the Trappist monks relocated to a more protected and rural location in Holland, Manitoba. In 1983, vandals set fire to the vacant chapel and monastery, reducing the historic buildings to shells. The guesthouse, located some distance away, remained untouched. In 1988, the Province of Manitoba designated the location a provincial historic site. The guesthouse became the home of the St. Norbert Arts Centre   in 1991. In 2002, the provincial government announced the creation of the two-hectare Trappist Monastery Provincial Park, preserving the historic ruins and preventing future commercial development on the site.\n\n\n=== Paroisse Catholique Saint-Norbert/St. Norbert Catholic Parish ===\nThe first church was built on the current site in 1857, and was made of logs. The newer building that replaced it in 1883 burned down in 1929. The current church was completed in 1937. The beautiful building has twin towers, and  houses the body of Father Joseph No\u00ebl Ritchot, St. Norbert\u2019s parish priest from 1862 to 1905. Father Ritchot was a supporter of the M\u00e9tis people, and of Louis Riel. Richot was a member of a delegation that travelled to Ottawa to meet with representatives of the Canadian government regarding the 1870 transfer of land in the Red River Settlement from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada. Across from the church is the tiny open-air Chapel of our Lady of Good Help (la Chapelle de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Secours). Ritchot and his parishioners built the chapel in 1875, to commemorate the success of the M\u00e9tis resistance of 1869\u201370. That dispute, eventually settled through negotiation, resulted in the inclusion of M\u00e9tis land, language, and school rights in The Manitoba Act of 1870, the basis of the Red River Settlement\u2019s entry into Confederation. In 1989, the chapel was declared a Manitoba provincial heritage site.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSt. Norbert is the southern gateway into the city of Winnipeg. Located just south of the Perimeter Highway, the community consists of what is called St. Norbert Village (the original community) and several modern suburbs.  The village is geographically bounded by the Red and LaSalle Rivers, and by the Perimeter Highway.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Forks (French: La Fourche) is a historic site, meeting place and green space in Downtown Winnipeg located at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine River. \nThe Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity. The site's 5.5-hectare (14-acre; 0.021 sq mi) grounds are open year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 6,000 years ago ===\nNumerous archaeological digs have shown that early Aboriginal groups arrived at The Forks site around 6,000 years ago. The digs conducted between 1989 and 1994 discovered several Aboriginal camps. Artifacts related to the bison hunt and fishing were unearthed. Evidence showed that Nakoda (Assiniboins), Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) and Sioux (Dakota) visited the site. Seasonal migration routes from northern forests to southern plains featured the Forks area as a rest stop, and the location became a key transcontinental trade link.The Assiniboine River has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River.\n\n\n=== 1734\u20131760 ===\nEuropean fur traders arrived at the site and initiated trade with the local peoples, using the Assiniboine people as fur trade middlemen.\n\n\n=== 1738\u20131880 ===\nEuropeans arrived by canoe in 1738. La V\u00e9rendrye erected Fort Rouge, the first of a long line of forts and trading posts erected in the area. The Red River Colony and the forts were all established near The Forks. The area remained the hub of the fur trade up until the 1880s. At that time, grain production became Western Canada\u2019s principal industry and the main transportation for that industry was rail rather than waterways.During the smallpox epidemics of 1781\u20131782, over half of the area's aboriginal population died.  At this time over 1,000 Aboriginal men, women, and children were buried in The Old Aboriginal Graveyard at The Forks.From 1760 to 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company competed for furs. Both companies used The Forks to store and ship supplies and furs. By 1821, competing fur companies were amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== 1886\u20131923 ===\nThe rail yards of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway were dominant facets of the Forks site, and this era is responsible for some of the buildings still standing at The Forks.The Forks Market was formed by joining together the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stable and the Great Northern Railway stable and Johnston Terminal was originally known as the National Cartage Building.The Manitoba Children\u2019s Museum is housed in what used to be the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company\u2019s Buildings and Bridges (B & B) Buildings. Union Station is still in operation.\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131920 ===\nAcross the Prairies the Canadian government began actively promoting immigration, settlement and railway development in the late 1800s. The Canadian government erected two immigration sheds at The Forks, each accommodating up to 500 people.\n\n\n=== The Forks today ===\n\nSince its designation in 1989, The Forks has contained public space for celebrations and recreation, an interpretive park, revitalized historic and new buildings containing shops and restaurants, as well as a skateboard park and historic port. The Forks attracts over four million visitors each year.\n\n\n== The Forks Market ==\n\nBeginning as two adjacent stables for competing rail companies, the horse stalls were joined together by a courtyard and bridges and became what is now known as The Forks Market.The Forks Market features a six storey tower with viewing platform, which is accessible by stairs or elevator and features interpretive panels with information on the site's history.\nThe market also comprises two storeys of vendors selling everything from fresh fruit, bread, meat, and wine to cigars and aromatherapy products to crafts and artworks from 300 local and Canadian artisans.In mid-2016, the Forks completed a $2.5-million renovation of the food hall into a feature called The Common, including a new beer and wine kiosk.\n\n\n== Johnston Terminal ==\n\nAcross the courtyard from the Forks Market is the four-storey Johnston Terminal building. Originally constructed in 1930, the terminal was a warehouse and freight-forwarding facility erected by Carter-Halls-Aldinger Company, and cost an estimated $134,700. After a substantial addition in 1930, the warehouse was at the time one of the largest in Winnipeg, containing over 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq ft) of usable space. It was occupied by National Storage and Cartage until 1961, and was leased to the Johnston National Cartage Company for the next 15 years.  Vacated in 1977, the building was unoccupied until the redevelopment of the site into The Forks. The original developers, Artis REIT, continue to own and manage Johnston Terminal. \nThe building is now home to a variety of specialty boutiques and stores, offices, a caf\u00e9, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. The basement of the building hosts the Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, which features over 30 consigners and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new merchandise brought in daily.\n\n\n== Travel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre ==\nTravel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre \u2013 Forks Location is the visitor information centre for Manitoba, offering travel counseling and trip planning services. The centre also acts as a meeting point for the \"6,000 Years in 60 Minutes!\" Parks Canada interpretive program offered throughout the summer months.\n\n\n== Manitoba Children's Museum ==\n\nLocated next to the Oodena Celebration Circle, the Manitoba Children's Museum is a non-profit, charitable children's museum featuring twelve permanent galleries. Originally opened at a different location in 1986, the museum's moved to its current building at the Forks in 1994. The museum is now housed in the former Kinsmen Building, which is the oldest surviving train repair facility in Manitoba, having been built in 1889.The museum underwent $10 million in renovations in 2011, including the addition of the Buhler Welcome Centre.\n\n\n== Manitoba Theatre for Young People ==\n\nThe Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults, located at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg. The location provides 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2) of space for the theatre to use towards its missions of producing entertaining professional theatre, providing training in theatre and portraying the experience of Canadian children.MTYP's Theatre School offers Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions, as well as Spring break and Summer camps, including classes for children as young as three years old. MTYP offers free acting, performing and film training classes to Winnipeg's Aboriginal youth between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\n== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ==\n\nThe Forks is the location of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (the first national museum outside of Ottawa). Its construction was completed in 2014.\nThe site for the museum is one of archaeological importance relating to First Nations history.\n\n\n== Inn at the Forks ==\n\nInn at the Forks is a five storey hotel located at the Forks. It has 117 guest rooms and suites, meeting and reception space for up to 200 people, fitness facilities, and features The Current Restaurant & Lounge and Riverstone Spa. The hotel features natural slate floors in the main lobby, glass vanities in the suite washrooms, heated floors, and a water wall in the spa.The Inn at the Forks project was the first Canadian application of the \u201cRedi-Maid\u201d system that links ensuite occupancy sensors, lighting and mechanical system controls to staff PDAs with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency. The hotel was completed with a construction cost of $16 million in May 2004.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Rail Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Rail Museum is located at the historic Union Station adjacent to the Forks. It is home to the Countess of Dufferin steam locomotive, the first locomotive to enter Western Canada.\n\n\n== Outdoor features ==\nThe Forks features numerous outdoor facilities, sculptures, and landscape features open to the public.\n\n\n=== Arctic Glacier Winter Park ===\n\nDuring winter, the following skating rinks, trails and snow park structures are erected at the Forks.\nThe Plaza Skating Rink\nAn Olympic-sized Skating Rink\nRink under Scotiabank Stage\n1.2 km of skating trails\nThe Snowboard Fun Park\nThe Toboggan Run\nIn January 2008, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized The Forks as the home of the longest skating rink in the world. The 8.54-kilometre-long Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail on the Assiniboine River and the Red River is almost 1 kilometer longer than the previous record-holding rink. The 7.8-kilometre long rink on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Ontario had lost its World Record title which it had held since 1971. Then in 2008 the rivers beat their own record which made the longest rink go to about 9.3-kilometres. The Rideau Canal still held the record for the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\". In 2013 the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail lost its record to the Lake Windermere Whiteway at Invermere, British Columbia, Canada.The length of the skating trail at The Forks changes each year, depending on river and ice conditions, although a concerted effort is made to make it as long as possible. In the winter of 2010/2011, conditions on The Assiniboine River made it impossible to safely create skating westward, so the path extended instead south on the Red River. Essentially, the water level and the weather at the time of freeze-up will impact the way the ice forms (see frazil ice, for example), how stable it will be, and how smoothly it can be made for skating. Much of the local river ice in Winnipeg in the winter of 2010/2011 was too rough to form a skating surface. There is also a skating trail made overland which is not impacted by river conditions. There are also walking and ski trails running parallel to the skating trail.\nWarming Huts: An Art + Architecture Competition on Ice is an open competition endorsed by the Manitoba Association of Architects. Started in 2010, the first iteration of the competition saw five local architects building outdoor structures to protect people from winter weather. In 2011, competition was opened up to international participants and included work by Frank Gehry's firm Gehry Partners. The competition has been awarded a Downtown Merit Award from the International Downtown Association. In January of each year, competition winners travel to Winnipeg for a week to build their warming huts, which are then relocated onto the frozen river for visitors to use. Warming huts are available until the end of the skating season. \n\n\n=== Assiniboine Riverwalk ===\n\nThe Assiniboine Riverwalk follows along the riverbanks from underneath Esplanade Riel to the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building.The Riverwalk is often closed due to river flooding in springtime. From the construction of the walkway to the summer of 2011, the walkway has been submerged beyond access for part of the summer for 16 out of 21 years.\n\n\n=== Balance of Spirit Within ===\n\"Balance of Spirit Within\" is a granite stone sculpture weighing approximately 10 tonnes, and is located on the north side of the Forks Historic Rail Bridge.\n\n\n=== Broadway Promenade ===\nThe Broadway Promenade is a pedestrian walkway connecting the Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge to Union Station and Broadway Avenue. Designed by Scatliff+Miller+Murray, the design incorporates two pathways which cross the site.  One pathway re-established the historic Broadway/Provencher Boulevard connection, and the other is a winding pathway representing pre-European contact era.\n\n\n=== Busk Stops ===\nThere are often buskers in and around the Forks. Buskers perform at stations known as \"Busk Stops\". They are paid by donation, but are prohibited from suggesting donation amounts or requesting contributions. There is an annual competition called the \"Scotiabank Busker's Festival\" at which it is decided who will be allowed to Busk.\n\n\n=== Esplanade Riel ===\n\nNamed in honor of Louis Riel,  Esplanade Riel is a pedestrian-only side-spar cable-stayed bridge which spans the Red River connecting downtown Winnipeg with St. Boniface, and it is paired with a vehicular bridge, the Provencher Bridge.\nThe Esplanade Riel is the only bridge with a restaurant in North America, and since July 2015 is occupied by Mon Ami Louis.  Former leasees include Salisbury House, a local Winnipeg chain restaurant, and Chez Sophie.\n\n\n=== Festival Park and Scotiabank Stage ===\nThe Scotiabank Stage is an outdoor stage with adjoining greenspace, built along the Broadway Promenade.In 2012, the signature events at the stage included Winnipeg's Pride Parade festival, Aboriginal Day Live hosted by APTN, Canada Day activities and the Folklorama Kick-Off.\n\n\n=== Flood markers ===\nThe posts on the canopy between the Forks Market and Johnston Terminal have bands on them to commemorate the peak water levels of major floods. Starting from the bottom of the posts, the bottom marker represents the 1950 flood, the middle marker represents both the 1852 and 1997 floods, and the top the flood of 1826. The flood line markers on one of the posts have historic plaques with information on the floods they represent.\n\n\n=== The Forks Historic Port ===\n\nPositioned along the Assiniboine Riverwalk, the historic port offers river vessel docking and rental, as well as access to the Splash Dash Water Bus.During times of flooding Splash Dash Water Bus employs a moveable ramp and floating dock system that allows it to operate in high water conditions.\n\n\n=== The Forks Market Plaza ===\nLocated directly in between the Forks Market, and Johnston Terminal, the Forks Market Plaza features fountains, canopies, dancing programs, several open performance spaces and patios.In the winter, the Plaza is home to an artificially cooled skating rink, under a canopy and lights.\n\n\n=== The Forks National Historic Site of Canada ===\nThe Forks National Historic Site of Canada is a 9.0 acre (3.63 hectare) park dedicated to \"preserving and presenting the 6,000-year history of human presence and activity at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers\", and is operated by Parks Canada.\nThe site features interpretive exhibits, sculptures, year-round walking trails, a dock, a canoe beach, a native prairie garden and a riverside amphitheatre for performances and events. Walking tours and presentations are offered throughout the summer.\n\n\n=== Historic Rail Bridge ===\nBuilt in 1888, the rail bridge was abandoned and eventually converted into a lighted crossing for pedestrians, cyclists and skaters.The mural on the side of the rail bridge is entitled \"Jackson Beardy \u2014 Woodlands Group of Seven Tribute\", and was painted in 2006 for Graffiti Gallery's Winnipeg International Mural Festival. The 30 foot wide and 20 foot tall mural pays tribute to Cree artist Jackson Beardy as well as the other members of the Indian Group of Seven.\n\n\n=== Oodena Celebration Circle ===\n\nOodena Celebration Circle is a natural shallow amphitheatre located between Johnston's Terminal, the Manitoba Children's Museum, and the Red River Riverwalk. \"Oodena\" is Cree for \"centre of the city\". Commissioned in 1993, the site was designed by the firm of Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm. The location features sculptures, a sundial, interpretive signage, a naked eye observatory and a ceremonial fire pit.The circular amphitheatre is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep. The 3 metres (9.8 ft) excavation for the site unearthed what is referred to by local archaeologists as \u201cthe archaic horizon\u201d, a 3,000-year-old layer of soil rich in artifacts.There are 8 unique steel armatures that rest on cobblestone formations surrounding the bowl.  Each armature points at a specific constellation, according to dates and times indicated on the panels surrounding the central stage.  Sighting rings on the armatures identify specific stars within the constellations. The supporting cobblestone formations bear inscriptions of various legends about the stars their armatures focus upon. The amphitheatre marks the vernal and autumnal equinox and the summer and winter solstices. \"The south armature features a shadow rod that casts solstice shadows on ground markers, the west armature is fitted with a wind sculpture, and the northeast armature features an aeolian harp.\" (Hilderman Thomas Frank Cramm \u2013 Oodena Celebration Circle)The site has been used as a meeting grounds for such varied events as \"No Stone Unturned\", a free concert in honour of Manitoba's missing and murdered women, as well as the 2011 opening night location for THIN AIR, the Winnipeg International Writers Festival and as the meeting location for Winnipeg's Zombie Walk 2012.\n\n\n=== Pan Am Games Monument ===\n\nThe Forks is home to the 1999 Pan Am Games Monument. Located beside the Inn at the Forks, the monument recognizes the governments, companies and individuals who supported the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The monument served as the flame cauldron for the games.The 1999 Pan Am Games mainstage concerts were held at the Scotiabank Stage and Festival Park.\n\n\n=== Peace Meeting Site ===\nThe \"Peace Meeting Site\" is a landscaped resting area along the Broadway Promenade, featuring Aboriginal and European elements, notable for having two gigantic Adirondack chairs.\n\n\n=== Prairie Garden ===\nThe Forks has a Prairie Garden, which is a natural wild garden with over 10,000 plants in over 150 native plant species, including 38 prairie plants such as prairie crocus, wild iris, bergamot, purple prairie clover and wild columbine.\n\n\n=== Public Orchard ===\nIn collaboration with Winnipeg-CORE, the public orchard at The Forks contains 61 fruit trees including apple, apricot, cherry, pear, and plum, which the public can pick to eat from when the fruit is ripe. There are as many as 75 fruit bearing shrubs packed with all types of berries to pick from during the summer days.\nThere are also many education sessions through Winnipeg-CORE that are open to the public, as part of The Fork's Target Zero initiative.\n\n\n=== Rail cars ===\n\nJust outside The Forks Market are two completely restored turn of the century rail cars. One car is for display, while the other is home to \"Sugar Mountain Express\", a candy store.\n\n\n=== Skatepark ===\n\nOfficially opened 30 June 2006, \"The Plaza\" is the largest urban skate plaza and bowl complex in Canada. Announced in 2005, it was built with money donated from the J.W. Burns Family Foundation. The skatepark includes a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, and an 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) 'bowl complex'.The design features 'skateable' artwork, and is built to tolerate the regular use and enjoyment of skateboarders and cyclists. The park was also designed to integrate into the urban architecture of the city. It was designed by Landscape Architecture firm: van der Zalm + associates inc. of Vancouver, BC with key team members, New Line Skateparks and Scatliff Miller Murray as the local landscape architects.\"Skate Patrol\" are experienced skateboarder staff members that tour the park from dawn to dusk to educate skaters on the park's etiquette.In winter, this area features a small snowboarding facility.In 2006, the park was visited by professional skateboarder Tony Hawk to shoot scenes for his movie release Secret Skatepark Tour 3.\n\n\n=== Variety Heritage Adventure Playground ===\nThe Variety Heritage Adventure Playground is an educational play structure for children, featuring water park elements.\n\n\n=== Wall Through Time ===\n\n\"Wall Through Time\" is a sculpture depicting the history of the Forks, which features two bronze shells and a limestone centrepiece.

        "wiki": "The Manitoba Museum, previously the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature is the largest museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is located close to City Hall. The museum was designed by Herbert Henry Gatenby Moody of Moody and Moore in 1965.\nThe museum is the largest heritage centre in Manitoba and focuses on human and natural heritage. It has planetarium shows and a Science Gallery hall. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the Manitoba Museum.\n\n\n== History of the Museum ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn 1879, the Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba began officially to collect and preserve its heritage at some unknown location.  In the early 1890s, E. Thompson Seton wrote about the Manitoba Museum, which was reportedly housed in the basement of Winnipeg's City Hall.  Those collections appear to have been dispersed, and by 1900 there was no public museum in Winnipeg.  There were, however, significant private collectors and from 1911 to the early 1920s material from their collections was exhibited in the Exposition Building of the former Winnipeg Industrial Bureau at Main and Water.  The present museum holds some of these collections although most were dispersed.\nIn 1932, the Natural History Society of Manitoba, the Winnipeg Board of Trade, and the Auditorium Commission founded the Manitoba Museum Association.  The Manitoba Museum officially opened its doors on December 15, 1932 in the newly built Civic Auditorium (now the Provincial Archives Building) on Vaughan Street.  The museum remained in that location, together with the Winnipeg Art Gallery, until 1967. Critical support for outreach programs and exhibits came from the Carnegie Corporation and Junior League.  Professors at the University of Manitoba, formerly the Manitoba Agriculture College, played significant roles in the museum's development.  The museum was run by volunteer Honorary Curators, with assistance from other dedicated volunteers and a small staff.\nAs the museum grew in acquisitions and attendance, the need for an expanded facility became critical, and in 1954 the Board began planning a new institution, which would reflect the values of the time.  They consulted extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium.  Funding came in large part from federal project sources designed to create new Canadian cultural facilities for the 1967 Canadian Centennial commemoration.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nIn 1964, a proposal for a museum and planetarium was submitted to the Manitoba government headed by Premier Duff Roblin.  The proposal stated that:Manitoba needs a Modern Museum of Man and Nature. Not a collection of stuffed birds, antiquated firearms or dusty rocks \u2013 but a living history of man and his environment, tracing the evolution of Manitoba's resources, industry and culture, past and present, and pointing the way, through research, to the future. To inform, instruct and educate by interpreting nature to man and their effect on each other in the function of a Modern Museum of Man and Nature.In 1965, provincial legislation dissolved the unincorporated Manitoba Museum Association and incorporated the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature and the Manitoba Planetarium, and the location as part of the planned Manitoba Centennial Centre was announced.  Paid curatorial positions were created, and the former volunteer curators were appointed to the Museum Advisory Council.  Most of the invaluable collections were transferred to the new corporation and during 1968-69, while the new building was being completed; the collections were put in storage.\n\nLieutenant Governor Richard Bowles opened the Planetarium on May 15, 1968, and the new museum facilities were officially opened in July, 1970 by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate the province's Centennial.\nAt the time of the official opening only the Orientation Gallery and part of the Grasslands Gallery were finished. The planetarium and museum were integrated as one corporation in 1988, and in 1996 the corporate name returned to the original Manitoba Museum.  The museum formally began using the name The Manitoba Museum in 2002.\nIn 1994, the Hudson's Bay Company designated the museum as the permanent home for its historic material collection, which portrays more than three centuries of the company's colourful history.  In 1996, construction got underway for a new wing to house this magnificent collection.  The new wing was officially opened in September, 1998, and the new HBC Gallery opened on May 2, 2000.\nWhen the last major gallery, Parklands/Mixed Woods, opened in September 2003, the grand design for a museum to portray the human and natural history of all of Manitoba was complete. A renewed Science Gallery opened in 2008 replacing the 'Touch the Universe' Gallery. The plan calls for a separate Science Museum building next to the Manitoba Museum.An expanded Alloway Hall opened in the spring of 2017. The new Hall is 9,750 square feet (906 m2) in size, doubling the previous space.The Winnipeg Gallery opened November 1, 2019. The purpose of this gallery is to tell the story of Winnipeg's development over the past century. It features a stained glass logo of Winnipeg that used to be located at the old \"gingerbread\" City Hall, and has not been seen since the 1960s.\nThe Manitoba Museum is in the process of upgrading its antiquated HVAC system in 2019.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe Manitoba Museum is the first Canadian museum to recreate marine life as it was 450 million years ago. A virtual underwater observatory shows the Hudson\u2019s Bay region during the Ordovician period.  Manitoba is home to the giant trilobite.\nThe collections in the museum reflect the heritage of Manitoba. The interpretive galleries are Earth History, Arctic/Sub-Arctic, Boreal Forest, Nonsuch, Hudson's Bay Company, Parklands/Mixed Woods, Grasslands and Urban.\nTogether these explore the history and environment of the province from its northern Arctic coast to its southern prairie grasslands. In particular the museum is famed for its Urban Gallery, which recreates a Winnipeg street scene in the 1920s.\nThe full-size replica of the Nonsuch, the ship whose voyage in 1668 led to the founding of the Hudson's Bay Company, is the museum's showcase piece.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe museum is affiliated with: CMA,  CHIN, the Canadian Association of Science Centres, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== History of the Planetarium ==\nThis section needs to be written (November 2019).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Manitoba Museum\nManitoba Museum YouTube channel",

        "wiki": "The Ross House Museum is a museum located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, housed in a log house (constructed 1852\u201355) that was designated a Winnipeg Landmark Heritage Structure in 1980.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally standing on the bank of the Red River at the foot of what is now Market Avenue, the building became the first post office in Western Canada with the appointment of William Ross (Metis) as postmaster by the Council of Assiniboia in 1855. The building was saved from demolition in 1947 by the Manitoba Historical Society and moved to Higgins Ave across from the C.P.R. station. There it was restored, with the land and house featuring artifacts, monuments and markers relevant to the early history of Manitoba. In 1984 the house was once more moved, this time to its present location in Joe Zuken Heritage Park in Point Douglas.\nMetis Postmaster William Ross was the second son of Alexander and Sarah Ross. He was born in the Columbia River area. When his father retired from the fur trade and he brought his wife and their children from British Columbia to Red River just after the amalgamation of the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company. William married Jemima McKenzie the daughter of the well-known fur trader, Roderick McKenzie. William was appointed Sheriff of Assiniboia in 1851 (after his father resigned from the post) and was appointed Post Master for Red River in 1855 by the Council of Assiniboia. He operated the postal service from his house near the Red River at the foot of Market Avenue. This house was built in 1851-52 by his sister Margaret's husband, Hugh Matteson.William donated the land for Winnipeg City Hall during the 1870s. The donation was conditional upon city hall not being moved. Other portions of the Ross estate were expropriated for Market Square and the Winnipeg Transfer Railway.Soil samples were conducted in 2011 at the site. Results were positive for \"significant toxins in the soil\".Ross House Museum received more than $31,000 (2015) in funding from the City of Winnipeg. However, under Mayor Bowman, these and other grants to civic museums were being reviewed.In 2018 operation of the Museum was given to the Seven Oaks House Museum from the Manitoba Historical Society. The MHS had cited lack of government funding and security issues as reasons for handing over responsibilities to another organization.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNorth Point Douglas\nLog building\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoss House Museum",

        "wiki": "The Living Prairie Museum is a 30 acres (12 ha) tall grass prairie preserve located between Daisy Road and Harcourt Street, east of Ness Ave. in the St. James-Assiniboia suburb in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nIt was discovered in 1968 when two botanists from a local sub-committee of the International Biological Program surveyed Manitoba for native prairie plant communities. Of more than 60 sites that were researched, only four were found uncultivated. One of the largest undisturbed sites was discovered in a residential area of Winnipeg. Today a vestige of this original prairie community has been set aside as a City of Winnipeg Nature Park, called the Living Prairie Museum.\nThe Living Prairie Museum is home to over 160 species of prairie grasses and wildflowers, as well as a great array of prairie wildlife. In Manitoba only 1/20th of 1% of original tall grass prairie remains. The Living Prairie Museum is one of the few preserves of this once vast ecosystem. This museum is defined by the historical interpretation of the Tall Grass Prairie of the Winnipeg Region.\nThe museum has an interpretative centre with displays on prairie history and ecology as well as an interactive art installation titled lost_landscape by Winnipeg artist Collin Zipp.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of St. James-Assiniboia set aside set aside 26.5 acres (10.7 ha) of virgin land untouched by urban development in Assiniboia, Manitoba, a suburb of Winnipeg to create the Living Prairie Museum in 1970. Preserving the land, it was projected to cost $90,000 over the 1970-1980/82 time period to maintain the space. The Report to St. James-Assiniboia Council at the time said:The importance of the St. James prairie as a sample of original vegetation can hardly be over-emphasized. More than 125 plant species have already been found on the site, and it is probable that others occur.\nMany of these are endangered species in Manitoba, for each year many natural areas disappear through agriculture and urbanization.\nIt is, however, a living community a complex inter-relationship of plants and other organisms with the environment that this site has particular significance.\n\nBecause of its location within the city this area offers an unusual for young and old to enjoy a natural remnant of our heritage.In 1973 an interpretive centre was approved by Winnipeg Council, who agreed to pay $50,000 (25% of the cost) of the 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) and would be counted as a Centennial project. A sod turning ceremony, attended by new Governor General Jules Leger took place in late April 1974.  The Interpretive Centre was opened on June 23, 1976.A year later, a group of residents lobbied to have an additional 50\u2013100 acres (20\u201340 ha), at the time zoned as Industrial, be added to the Living Prairie Museum.In the 1960s Metro planned for the Western Fwy. along Silver Ave. which would have cut through the Living Prairie Museum. The residents suggested the Freeway be built further north. However this plan was cancelled.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA,  CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiving Prairie Museum\nLiving Prairie Virtual Museum\nFriends of Living Prairie",

      "name": "Assiniboine Park - Steam Train",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Assiniboine Park (formerly known as City Park) is a park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Winnipeg Public Parks Board was formed in 1893, and purchased the initial land for the park in 1904. Although in use before then, the park officially opened in 1909, and is located north of the Assiniboine Forest, along the Assiniboine River. It is named for the Assiniboine people. The park covers 1,100 acres (450 ha), of which 400 acres (160 ha) are designed in the English landscape style.\nThe park includes the 700-acre (280 ha) Assiniboine Forest, Assiniboine Park Zoo, Assiniboine Park Conservatory, the historic Assiniboine Park Pavilion, formal and informal gardens, a sculpture garden, a miniature railway, an outdoor theatre for performing arts, and numerous other attractions. \n\n\n== Prominent attractions ==\n\n\n=== Conservatory and gardens ===\nOne of the earliest park features and a major indoor attraction, The Conservatory is a botanical garden housing more than 8,000 flowers, plants and trees that are non-native to Manitoba, but which grow profusely under the ideal conditions created in the Palm House and Display Garden. The original Palm House was erected in 1914, and in 1968 a fully modern structure was built over and around the Palm House, enclosing it.It was announced in early 2018 that the Assiniboine Park Conservatory would close permanently in April 2018 due to ongoing renovation costs and it reaching the end of its \"useful life\". The building has since been demolished, and usage of the existing space has not been determined. In 2018 a group of citizens spoke out about the future Diversity Gardens, that visitors will have to pay an admission fee like at the Zoo, and that this will cause lower income citizens to be unable to afford to visit the new displays.Known throughout North America for its luxuriant display of thousands of annual and perennial flowers, the English Garden (established between 1926 and 1927) contains nearly three acres of flowers, shrubs and trees arranged in the traditional English style. From the outset, the English Garden was designed to serve as a popular park attraction where local residents and tourists could obtain information about specialized floriculture in Manitoba. New plant varieties have been introduced annually. A large rose garden (with more than 400 bushes (there are only a few remnants of roses in this area.) of Floribunda, Grandiflora and Rugosa varieties), broken into four sections, surrounds a central, fish-filled lily pond. (No roses exist in this area, the central pond has a large fountain in it, no fish or lilies exist.)\nThe English Garden is open free of charge to the public every day of the year.\nThe Formal Garden, located at the southeast park entrance, was designed in 1907 by Frederick Todd as part of the original park. It features flower beds in sharply defined geometric shapes that stand out from the grassy areas. Each of the beds, as well as the overall design, is symmetrical.The Leo Mol Sculpture Garden displays more than three hundred works by Dr. Leo Mol, including bronze and ceramic sculptures, paintings and drawings. Opened in 1992, the sculpture garden has been expanded twice since.\n\n\n=== Pavilion and theatre ===\n\nThe park's signature feature, the Assiniboine Park Pavilion became a focus of early Winnipeg's social life. Originally designed by John D. Atchison and built in 1908, it included a dance hall, a banquet hall, lunch and catering. The 90-foot (27 m) tower contained the pump and water tower for the park's water system. It was destroyed by fire in May 1929. The current larger pavilion was designed by architects Northwood and Chivers, and was opened in May 1930. It is today one of Winnipeg's most familiar landmarks.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre is a large outdoor stage located next to the Pavilion.  Opened in 1999, it carries on the tradition of bandshell entertainment near the Pavilion that started in the 1920s.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe  90 acres (36 ha) Assiniboine Park Zoo is at the western end of the park just North of the main parking area, and is home to over 300 animal species. It initially opened in July 1908.\n\n\n=== Foot Bridge ===\nThe first foot bridge was built in 1908 when the Park had initially opened. However, in later years it was determined that a wider and safer bridge would be needed.\nA second bridge, connecting the suburb of St. James (at Overdale St.) with Assiniboine Park is an active transportation/pedestrian bridge, and officially opened in May 1932 by Winnipeg Mayor Ralph Webb.\n\n\n=== Duck Pond ===\n\nToward the north of the park, and just to one side of the pedestrian footbridge from Portage Avenue is the serpentine Duck Pond. Originally a fenced area, in the 2010s the Duck Pond was upgraded with new plants and benches. Although called a duck pond, it is more common to find Canada geese swimming there.\n\n\n=== Children's Nature and Adventure Playground ===\nOpened in May 2011 as part of the Park's redevelopment, a 0.81 ha (2-acre) Children's Nature and Adventure Playground was built as a children's play area. It is located adjacent to the Pavilion and cost $6 million. The play area features a kid-size doorway, although adult throughway is also provided. The relocated Winnie the Pooh statue is inside the Nature Playground area.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAdjacent to Roblin Boulevard, the last steam locomotive to run scheduled service in Canada, CNR 6043, Class U-1-d, 4-8-2, is on permanent display courtesy of the Winnipeg Railway Museum.  A 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railway named Assiniboine Park Railroad operates in one section of the park, which features a working steam locomotive made by Crown Metal Products.  Additionally, a private rideable miniature railway named the Assiniboine Valley Railway, with a track gauge of 7 1\u20442 in (190.5 mm), is located outside the park near the zoo.\nThe park also includes picnic areas.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe park offers playgrounds, a bicycle path, baseball and cricket fields with three cricket pitches (upper and lower grounds) and a clubhouse on site. The park is the Manitoba Cricket League's premier facility for hosting club cricket. (Turf wickets are going to be installed on the cricket field and used for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2012).\nThe Terry Fox Fitness Trail, dedicated to the Canadian humanitarian's memory, is designed for disabled and non-disabled individuals alike. Assiniboine Park is wheelchair-accessible.\n\n\n== Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project ==\nThe Assiniboine Park Riparian Forest Project strives to help the riparian forest bounce back from heavy use and enhance the recreational trail experience. The ongoing riverbank restoration project, begun in 2006, continues each summer.The project concerns the strip of forest along the Assiniboine River within Assiniboine Park, a well-known and much-loved recreational area just east of the footbridge on the south side of Portage Avenue. Over many years, the forest has suffered a loss of vegetation due to flooding, invasive plant species that replace native species, and trampling from recreational activities such as hiking and biking. Generations of heavy usage has resulted in the creation of an extensive trail network, soil compaction and large areas of bare ground.Restoration is underway in the forest through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\nWinnipeg arts and culture\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSpector, David (2019).

        "wiki": "Fort Garry, also known as Upper Fort Garry, was a Hudson's Bay Company trading post at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in what is now downtown Winnipeg. It was established in 1822 on or near the site of the North West Company's Fort Gibraltar established by John Wills in 1810 and destroyed by Governor Semple's men in 1816 during the Pemmican War. Fort Garry was named after Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. It served as the centre of fur trade within the Red River Colony.  In 1826, a severe flood destroyed the fort. It was rebuilt in 1835 by the HBC and named Upper Fort Garry to differentiate it from \"the Lower Fort,\" or Lower Fort Garry, 32 km downriver, which was established in 1831. Throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, Upper Fort Garry played a minor role in the actual trading of furs, but was central to the administration of the HBC and the surrounding settlement. The Council of Assiniboia, the administrative and judicial body of the Red River Colony mainly run by Hudson's Bay Company officials, met at Upper Fort Garry.\nIn 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to surrender its monopoly in the North-West, including Upper Fort Garry. In late 1869 and early 1870, the fort was seized by Louis Riel and his M\u00e9tis followers during the Red River Rebellion. After the Rebellion, the area around the fort continued to grow. In 1873, the city of Winnipeg was established and the name Fort Garry was no longer used. In 1881-1884 the majority of the fort was demolished to straighten Main Street (it was at Main Street and Assiniboine Avenue).\nAlthough only the main gate of the fort remains today, the name \"Fort Garry\" lives on through various institutions and businesses. An area or division of Winnipeg running along the Red River south of the original fort is called Fort Garry.  The hotel beside the fort is called the Fort Garry Hotel, which was originally constructed for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway company. The two streets on either side of the hotel are Fort Street and Garry Street. Many companies have adopted the name, such as Fort Garry Industries and the Fort Garry Brewing Company. The Fort Garry Horse has been a component of the Winnipeg military garrison throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries.\n\n\n== National Historic Site ==\nFort Garry, along with the sites of nearby Forts Rouge and Gibraltar, were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1924, under the name \"Forts Rouge, Garry, and Gibraltar National Historic Site\".  Together, the three sites are illustrative of the evolution of the fur trade in Western Canada, from exploration and expansion westward (Fort Rouge, established in 1738 by the French), to the dominance of the North West Company (Fort Gibraltar, established in 1807) and finally the ascendancy of the Hudson's Bay Company (Fort Garry).  The gate at Fort Garry constitutes the only above-ground remains of this succession of forts.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn 15 June 1938 Canada Post issued 'Fort Garry Gate, Winnipeg', a 20\u00a2 stamp. G\n\n\n== Provincial Heritage Park ==\n\nWork has begun on a project to establish a heritage park in the area surrounding what remains of the Upper Fort Garry. In the spring of 2010, a bill passed the House in the Manitoba Legislature, entitled The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act.\nIn 2007, a development company, Crystal Developers, sought to build an apartment complex next to the fort's original \"footprint\". However, the Friends of Upper Fort Garry, a group dedicated to developing an historical interpretive park at the site, was convened to oppose them. The plan called for an interpretive centre just outside the old fort's walls, and a large surface parking lot that would have been placed closer to the walls than the apartment itself. After a City of Winnipeg-imposed deadline  to raise funds to build a park on the site was nearing, Crystal Developers decided to grant the Friends an additional two years to finish raising the needed funds. Crystal ultimately bowed out of its proposed development plans. Two years later the City of Winnipeg approved the construction by Crystal Developers of a 25-storey apartment tower just west of the original location, on Assiniboine Ave.Enough funds were raised by the Friends to purchase the buildings already on the site of their proposed heritage park, including a Petro-Canada gas station. The only building that was allowed to stay untouched was the current home of the Manitoba Club, which started as an organization in 1874, only one year after the incorporation of Winnipeg. The existing Manitoba Club building was completed in 1905. The historic Fort Garry Hotel across the street was built shortly thereafter, in 1913.\nThe plans for the future heritage park at the site of Upper Fort Garry were officially unveiled in May 2010.From the Hansard Records of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, dated Monday, June 14, 2010, it is clear that the boundaries of the proposed Upper Fort Garry Provincial Heritage Park, described in Bill 27\u2013The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act then under consideration, would not include the Manitoba Club building. In the meeting referenced above, Mr. Jerry Gray (Friends of Upper Fort Garry), referring to the future park boundaries, states that the property is \"bordered by Main Street on the east side, Assiniboine on the south side and Fort Street on the west side and then goes up to the back where the gate property is.\" Evidently, the Manitoba Club property on Broadway is excluded from the proposed heritage park, aside from being located on the same city block. According to the records of the Thirty-Ninth Legislature, Bill 27 received Royal Assent on June 17, 2010, by Proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor Philip S. Lee.The park opened to the public on August 6, 2015, with development still to come.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCouncil of Keewatin\nFort Rouge (fortification)\nHistory of Winnipeg\nTemporary North-West Council\nCoat of arms of Winnipeg\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nFriends of Upper Fort Garry\nThe Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act\nManitoba Historical Maps, Images and Maps of Fort Garry\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Winnipeg ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America.\nThe city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2016, Winnipeg is the seventh-most populated municipality in Canada, with a resident population of about 778,500. Being far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and average July highs of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F).Known as the \"Gateway to the West\", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nWinnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as \"The Forks\". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.Sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the M\u00e9tis because of sharing a traditional culture.\n\nLord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M\u00e9tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.In 1869\u201370, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of M\u00e9tis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. M\u00e9tis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1900\u2013present) ===\nBy 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.\n\nMore than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled \"Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise\" (commonly known as the \"Golden Boy\"). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nIn the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan \"unicity\" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011, in each of these floods, the Red River Floodway was used to safely protect the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWinnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of 464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around \u221216.4 \u00b0C (2.5 \u00b0F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in). Temperatures occasionally drop below \u221240.0 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F). The actual air temperature drops below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) on average 12.6 days annually and rises above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) 13.3 days of the year. On average there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average. With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city in Canada. Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over 51 centimetres (20 in). Thunderstorms are very common during summer, and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. Low wind chill values are a common occurrence in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as \u221257 \u00b0C (\u221270.6 \u00b0F) and on average there are twelve days of the year that can reach a wind chill below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F).The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was 42.2 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily low temperature was 28.3 \u00b0C (82.9 \u00b0F) on 12 July 1936. The apparent heat can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity, and on 25 July 2007 a humidex reading of 47.3 \u00b0C (117.1 \u00b0F) was measured.The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe winters. The last spring frost is on average around 23 May, whilst the first fall frost is on 22 September.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThere are officially 236 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg.

To the south, Winnipeg is connected to the United States via Provincial Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75) (a continuation of I-29 and US 75, known as Pembina Highway or Route 42 within Winnipeg). The highway runs 107 km (66 mi) to Emerson, Manitoba, and is the busiest Canada\u2013United States border crossing on the Prairies. The four-lane Perimeter Highway, built in 1969, serves as a Ring Road, with at-grade intersections and a few interchanges. It allows travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway to bypass the city. A recent study cited dangerous intersections and low efficiency as its primary shortfalls. The Trans-Canada Highway runs east to west through the city (city route), or circles around the city on the Perimeter Highway (beltway). Some of the city's major arterial roads include Route 80 (Waverley St.), Route 155 (McGillivray Blvd), Route 165 (Bishop Grandin Blvd.), Route 17 (Chief Peguis Trail), and Route 90 (Brookside Blvd., Oak Point Hwy., King Edward St., Century St., Kenaston Blvd.).\n\nThe Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport completed a $585-million redevelopment in October 2011. The development brought a new terminal, a four-level parking facility, and other infrastructure improvements. Winnipeg Bus Terminal, at Winnipeg International Airport, offers domestic and international service by Greyhound Canada, Grey Goose Bus Lines, Winnipeg Shuttle Service and Brandon Air Shuttle. Approximately 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land to the north and west of the airport has been designated as an inland port, CentrePort Canada, and is Canada's first Foreign Trade Zone. It is a private sector initiative to develop the infrastructure for Manitoba's trucking, air, rail and sea industries. In 2009, construction began on a $212-million four-lane freeway to connect CentrePort with the Perimeter Highway. Named CentrePort Canada Way, it opened in November 2013.Several taxi companies serve Winnipeg, the largest being Unicity, Duffy's Taxi and Spring Taxi. Fifty percent of Winnipeg residents use a taxi at least once during the year. Ride sharing was legalized in March 2018 and several services including TappCar and Cowboy Taxi operate in Winnipeg. Cycling is popular in Winnipeg, and there are many bicycle trails and lanes around the city. Winnipeg holds an annual Bike-to-Work Day and Cyclovia, and bicycle commuters may be seen year-round, even in the winter. Active living infrastructure in Winnipeg encourages bicycling through the inclusion of bike lanes and sharrows.\n\n\n=== Medical centres and hospitals ===\n\nWinnipeg's major hospitals include Health Sciences Centre, Concordia Hospital, Deer Lodge Centre, Grace Hospital, Misericordia Health Centre, Riverview Health Centre, Saint Boniface General Hospital, Seven Oaks General Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, and The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg.The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is one of only a handful of biosafety level 4 microbiology laboratories in the world. The NML houses laboratories of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease collocated in the same facility. Research facilities are also operated through hospitals and private biotechnology companies in the city.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nWater and sewage services are provided by the city. The city draws its water via an aqueduct from Shoal Lake, treating and fluoridating it at the Deacon Reservoir just outside the city prior to pumping it into the Winnipeg system. The city's system has over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) of underground water mains, which are subject to breakage during extreme weather conditions.Electricity and natural gas are provided by Manitoba Hydro, a provincial crown corporation headquartered in the city; it uses primarily hydroelectric power. The primary telecommunications carrier is MTS, although other corporations offer telephone, cellular, television and internet services.\nWinnipeg contracts out several services to private companies, including garbage and recycling collection and street plowing and snow removal. This practice represents a significant budget expenditure and is more expansive than in comparable communities. The services have faced numerous complaints from residents in 2013\u201314 about missed service.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\n \nCanadian Forces Base Winnipeg, co-located at the airport, is home to many flight operations support divisions and several training schools. It is also the headquarters of 1 Canadian Air Division and the Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Region, as well as the home base of 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces. The Wing comprises three squadrons and six schools; it also provides support to the Central Flying School. Excluding the three levels of government, 17 Wing is the fourth largest employer in the city. The Wing supports 113 units, stretching from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan\u2013Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel to the high Arctic. 17 Wing also acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter-bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.There are two squadrons based in the city. The 402 \"City of Winnipeg\" Squadron flies the Canadian-designed and produced de Havilland CT-142 Dash 8 navigation trainer. The 435 \"Chinthe\" Transport and Rescue Squadron flies the Lockheed CC-130 Hercules in airlift search and rescue roles. In addition, 435 Squadron is the only Royal Canadian Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct tactical air-to-air refueling of fighter aircraft.For many years, Winnipeg was the home of the Second Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Initially, the battalion was based at the Fort Osborne Barracks, now the location of the Rady Jewish Community Centre. They eventually moved to the Kapyong Barracks between River Heights and Tuxedo. Since 2004, the battalion has operated out of CFB Shilo near Brandon.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n Media related to Winnipeg at Wikimedia Commons\n Winnipeg travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "It is not unlikely any other visitor center with friendly staff trying to get you involved in the corresponding national park. Even though, the Wapusk National Park is quite far away, it's ambasadors, the Polar bears, are a constant parameter in Chruchill. So this visitor center",

        "wiki": "The Winnipeg Police Service is the police force of the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Winnipeg became a city, in 1873, an election was held to select the city's new mayor and aldermen. Those appointed decided to hire city officials, including a chief constable. On February 23, 1874, John S. Ingram was appointed the first Chief of Police of Winnipeg.During the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike, most of the force was replaced with 2000 better-paid special constables, for refusing to sign a declaration promising to not belong to a union or participate in a sympathy strike, even though they remained on duty during the strike. The union was thus broken, and Chris H. Newton became the acting chief constable.\nIn 1972, Winnipeg merged with its eight neighbouring communities, causing their amalgamation, but still having eight police services with different uniforms and radio channels. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) contract for Charleswood and Headingly was cancelled, and that area fell under the inner city patrol area. On October 21, 1974, the amalgamation of the services was complete, and the remaining eight services formed into six districts. On January 1, 1975, all police officers in Winnipeg started to wear the same uniform with matching shoulder flashes that stated, \"One, with the strength of many\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, J.B. Dale Henry, a retired RCMP officer and former commander of the Manitoba \"D\" Division, was selected as the first chief of police not from the service's own ranks. Henry was well respected amongst minorities and sought to change and improve the image of police in Winnipeg. One of the most noticeable changes was the name for the police, from the \"Winnipeg Police Force\" (which it had been for 120 years), to the \"Winnipeg Police Service\". Another change was the addition of the motto \"Community Commitment\".\nHenry also changed the department crest to the one known today and pictured above. The 13 golden stars on the badge represent the 13 communities that came together to form Winnipeg during the amalgamation in the 1970s, and the crocus is the provincial flower.\nIn 2003, city council approved a plan by the Winnipeg Police Service to go from six districts, to four. This plan involved three new police facilities. The new East District Station was completed in 2008, and the West District Station was completed in November 2013.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Winnipeg Police Service  is headed by  Chief of Police Danny Smyth, appointed November 8, 2016, succeeding Chief Devon Clunis who retired July 9, 2016. The three deputy chiefs are Art Stannard, Gord Perrier, and Jeff Szyszkowski. The service has 1,442 officers of which approximately half are on the front lines, known as \"general patrol\" (uniform operations). The WPS also has over 510 civilian workers.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe Winnipeg Police Service headquarters is located at 266 Graham Avenue, in the former Canada Post sortation facility, in the downtown area. The previous headquarters were the Public Safety Building, built in 1966, and is currently slated for demolition to make way for the Marketlands development.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe City of Winnipeg is divided into four policing districts: Downtown, West, North and East.  Each district contains several generalized and specialized police units.\nSpecialized units include:\n\nBicycle patrol\nBomb disposal\nCanine\nCentral traffic\nCrowd management\nPhoto enforcement\nPawn\nRiver patrol\nUnderwater search and recovery\nVictim services\nStreet crime\nTactical support team (TST) \u2013 formerly the part-time emergency response unit (ERU) made up of officers trained for special circumstances, such as hostage situations, armed and barricaded incidents and search warrants\nTraining  \u2013 includes, police vehicle operations instructors, policy and law instructors, firearms instructors, and use of force instructors \u2013 located at the WPS Training Academy\nDivision 40 \u2013 criminal investigation bureau \u2013 homicide, drugs, hate crimes, major crimes, morals, integrated proceeds of crime (IPOC), organized crime and Crime Stoppers\nDivision 41 \u2013 criminal investigation bureau \u2013 missing persons, child abuse, Internet child exploitation (ICE), domestic violence, high risk offenders, sex crimes, vulnerable persons, and youth crime\nDivision 42 \u2013 criminal investigation bureau \u2013 arson, commercial crime, stolen auto, pawn, surveillance and forensic services\nFlight operations\nAuxiliary force cadet section\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nFord Police Interceptor Sedan\nFord Police Interceptor Utility\nEC120 Colibri\nChevrolet Impala Police Package\nChevrolet Tahoe Police Package\nTerradyne Armored Vehicle Gurka\n\n\n== Ranks and Insignia ==\n\n\n== Recruitment ==\nPotential trainees must be at least eighteen years old with a high school diploma, and able to complete the Police Officer's Physical Aptitude Test (POPAT), which determines a recruit's physical ability. Training is salaried and takes 37 weeks consisting of classroom time, use of force and in the field training with assigned field training officers who supervise them while they carry out all regular duties. After this process is finished the recruit is inducted into the police service. After five years of general patrol service, officers may apply for specialty divisions like those listed above.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Police Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Police Museum is a museum that displays the history of the Winnipeg Police Service from 1874 to the present. Pictures, equipment, vehicles and other artifacts are presented within the museum. An original 1911 jail cell from the North End Station is one of the highlights of the museum.  In June 2016, the museum moved to a new location inside police headquarters at 245 Smith Street.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Incidents involving Aboriginals ===\n\nOn March 9, 1988, Winnipeg Police constable Robert Cross approached Aboriginal John Joseph Harper, having mistaken him for an auto theft suspect, a struggle ensued . Harper grabbed the officer's service revolver and while struggle ensued the gun went off, killing Harper. Initially, this shooting was ruled as justified by the internal firearms board of enquiry. Subsequently, however, the shooting and other events led to the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, a comprehensive investigation into the treatment of First Nations people within the Manitoba justice system. In 1991, the inquiry concluded that the WPS internal investigation was faulty and intended more to exonerate Cross than to discover the truth. Furthermore, they ruled that Constable Cross had used excessive force and was therefore responsible for Harper's death even though Harper grabbed at the officer's revolver. Constable Cross left the department citing stress and died prematurely of heart disease in his 40s.   The report recommended that, in the future, officer-involved shootings be investigated by independent parties.\n\n\n==== Recent cases ====\nOn January 31, 2005, 18-year-old Matthew Dumas was armed with a screwdriver and was confronted by Constable Dennis Gbarek (a Metis officer). At the time, police were investigating a home invasion and Dumas was believed to be involved. The constable ordered Dumas to drop the screwdriver several times while Dumas responded by lunging at the constable and was shot. Dumas died from his injuries, It was later determined he was not involved in the home invasion. Two reviews of the shooting were performed by the Calgary Police Service in August 2006 and by the Ontario Crown Attorney's Office in May 2007 at the Manitoba government's request. Both reviews concluded the Winnipeg Police investigation of the shooting was handled properly. In June 2008, an inquest was held into Dumas's death. The inquest's report, released in December 2008, ruled that racism was not a factor in the incident.Two incidents in the summer of 2008 sparked further accusations of racism within the police service. In July, 17-year-old Michael Langan, a M\u00e9tis, died after being tasered by police. Witnesses had reported a youth breaking into a vehicle, and police encountered Langan several blocks away, allegedly wielding a knife and refusing to surrender. David Chartrand, president of the Manitoba Metis Federation, suggested that racial profiling may have resulted in police using excessive force, an accusation that Police Chief Keith McCaskill denied. In August, Craig McDougall, a member of Wasagamack First Nation and nephew of John Joseph Harper, was tasered then shot by police responding to a disturbance call in the city's West End. Police reported that McDougall was brandishing a knife, though family members have disputed that claim, saying McDougall was carrying a cellular phone.\n\n\n=== Other incidents ===\n\nIn February 2005, a truck driven by off-duty WPS constable Derek Harvey-Zenk, reportedly drunk after having attended an all-night party, rear-ended and killed Crystal Taman, a 40-year-old woman, while she was stopped at a red light. The incident was initially investigated by East St. Paul Police. Harvey-Zenk was originally charged with \"impaired driving causing death\" and numerous other charges. In July 2007, however, Harvey-Zenk was pled down to \"dangerous driving causing death\" (a lesser charge) and given a conditional sentence of \"two years less a day\", to be served at his home.Public outcry over the plea and allegations that the investigation had been botched led to a provincial inquiry, which began in June 2008. At the inquiry, multiple police officers testified that they did not notice Harvey-Zenk drinking, leading to allegations of a police cover-up. Furthermore, a waitress who served the officers liquor throughout the evening testified that she was pressured to not \"remember too much\" by the restaurant's manager, who was friends with the officers. Officers involved in the investigation have denied they gave preferential treatment to Harvey-Zenk.\n\n\n== Chiefs of Police ==\n\n\n=== Chief Constables of the Winnipeg Police Force ===\nJohn S.

        "wiki": "The Forks (French: La Fourche) is a historic site, meeting place and green space in Downtown Winnipeg located at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine River. \nThe Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity. The site's 5.5-hectare (14-acre; 0.021 sq mi) grounds are open year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 6,000 years ago ===\nNumerous archaeological digs have shown that early Aboriginal groups arrived at The Forks site around 6,000 years ago. The digs conducted between 1989 and 1994 discovered several Aboriginal camps. Artifacts related to the bison hunt and fishing were unearthed. Evidence showed that Nakoda (Assiniboins), Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) and Sioux (Dakota) visited the site. Seasonal migration routes from northern forests to southern plains featured the Forks area as a rest stop, and the location became a key transcontinental trade link.The Assiniboine River has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River.\n\n\n=== 1734\u20131760 ===\nEuropean fur traders arrived at the site and initiated trade with the local peoples, using the Assiniboine people as fur trade middlemen.\n\n\n=== 1738\u20131880 ===\nEuropeans arrived by canoe in 1738. La V\u00e9rendrye erected Fort Rouge, the first of a long line of forts and trading posts erected in the area. The Red River Colony and the forts were all established near The Forks. The area remained the hub of the fur trade up until the 1880s. At that time, grain production became Western Canada\u2019s principal industry and the main transportation for that industry was rail rather than waterways.During the smallpox epidemics of 1781\u20131782, over half of the area's aboriginal population died.  At this time over 1,000 Aboriginal men, women, and children were buried in The Old Aboriginal Graveyard at The Forks.From 1760 to 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company competed for furs. Both companies used The Forks to store and ship supplies and furs. By 1821, competing fur companies were amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n=== 1886\u20131923 ===\nThe rail yards of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company, the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway were dominant facets of the Forks site, and this era is responsible for some of the buildings still standing at The Forks.The Forks Market was formed by joining together the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stable and the Great Northern Railway stable and Johnston Terminal was originally known as the National Cartage Building.The Manitoba Children\u2019s Museum is housed in what used to be the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company\u2019s Buildings and Bridges (B & B) Buildings. Union Station is still in operation.\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131920 ===\nAcross the Prairies the Canadian government began actively promoting immigration, settlement and railway development in the late 1800s. The Canadian government erected two immigration sheds at The Forks, each accommodating up to 500 people.\n\n\n=== The Forks today ===\n\nSince its designation in 1989, The Forks has contained public space for celebrations and recreation, an interpretive park, revitalized historic and new buildings containing shops and restaurants, as well as a skateboard park and historic port. The Forks attracts over four million visitors each year.\n\n\n== The Forks Market ==\n\nBeginning as two adjacent stables for competing rail companies, the horse stalls were joined together by a courtyard and bridges and became what is now known as The Forks Market.The Forks Market features a six storey tower with viewing platform, which is accessible by stairs or elevator and features interpretive panels with information on the site's history.\nThe market also comprises two storeys of vendors selling everything from fresh fruit, bread, meat, and wine to cigars and aromatherapy products to crafts and artworks from 300 local and Canadian artisans.In mid-2016, the Forks completed a $2.5-million renovation of the food hall into a feature called The Common, including a new beer and wine kiosk.\n\n\n== Johnston Terminal ==\n\nAcross the courtyard from the Forks Market is the four-storey Johnston Terminal building. Originally constructed in 1930, the terminal was a warehouse and freight-forwarding facility erected by Carter-Halls-Aldinger Company, and cost an estimated $134,700. After a substantial addition in 1930, the warehouse was at the time one of the largest in Winnipeg, containing over 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq ft) of usable space. It was occupied by National Storage and Cartage until 1961, and was leased to the Johnston National Cartage Company for the next 15 years.  Vacated in 1977, the building was unoccupied until the redevelopment of the site into The Forks. The original developers, Artis REIT, continue to own and manage Johnston Terminal. \nThe building is now home to a variety of specialty boutiques and stores, offices, a caf\u00e9, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. The basement of the building hosts the Johnston Terminal Antique Mall, which features over 30 consigners and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new merchandise brought in daily.\n\n\n== Travel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre ==\nTravel Manitoba Visitor Information Centre \u2013 Forks Location is the visitor information centre for Manitoba, offering travel counseling and trip planning services. The centre also acts as a meeting point for the \"6,000 Years in 60 Minutes!\" Parks Canada interpretive program offered throughout the summer months.\n\n\n== Manitoba Children's Museum ==\n\nLocated next to the Oodena Celebration Circle, the Manitoba Children's Museum is a non-profit, charitable children's museum featuring twelve permanent galleries. Originally opened at a different location in 1986, the museum's moved to its current building at the Forks in 1994. The museum is now housed in the former Kinsmen Building, which is the oldest surviving train repair facility in Manitoba, having been built in 1889.The museum underwent $10 million in renovations in 2011, including the addition of the Buhler Welcome Centre.\n\n\n== Manitoba Theatre for Young People ==\n\nThe Manitoba Theatre for Young People (MTYP) is a theatre for children and young adults, located at the Canwest Performing Arts Centre in The Forks, Winnipeg. The location provides 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2) of space for the theatre to use towards its missions of producing entertaining professional theatre, providing training in theatre and portraying the experience of Canadian children.MTYP's Theatre School offers Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions, as well as Spring break and Summer camps, including classes for children as young as three years old. MTYP offers free acting, performing and film training classes to Winnipeg's Aboriginal youth between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\n== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ==\n\nThe Forks is the location of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (the first national museum outside of Ottawa). Its construction was completed in 2014.\nThe site for the museum is one of archaeological importance relating to First Nations history.\n\n\n== Inn at the Forks ==\n\nInn at the Forks is a five storey hotel located at the Forks. It has 117 guest rooms and suites, meeting and reception space for up to 200 people, fitness facilities, and features The Current Restaurant & Lounge and Riverstone Spa. The hotel features natural slate floors in the main lobby, glass vanities in the suite washrooms, heated floors, and a water wall in the spa.The Inn at the Forks project was the first Canadian application of the \u201cRedi-Maid\u201d system that links ensuite occupancy sensors, lighting and mechanical system controls to staff PDAs with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency. The hotel was completed with a construction cost of $16 million in May 2004.\n\n\n== Winnipeg Rail Museum ==\nThe Winnipeg Rail Museum is located at the historic Union Station adjacent to the Forks. It is home to the Countess of Dufferin steam locomotive, the first locomotive to enter Western Canada.\n\n\n== Outdoor features ==\nThe Forks features numerous outdoor facilities, sculptures, and landscape features open to the public.\n\n\n=== Arctic Glacier Winter Park ===\n\nDuring winter, the following skating rinks, trails and snow park structures are erected at the Forks.\nThe Plaza Skating Rink\nAn Olympic-sized Skating Rink\nRink under Scotiabank Stage\n1.2 km of skating trails\nThe Snowboard Fun Park\nThe Toboggan Run\nIn January 2008, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized The Forks as the home of the longest skating rink in the world. The 8.54-kilometre-long Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail on the Assiniboine River and the Red River is almost 1 kilometer longer than the previous record-holding rink. The 7.8-kilometre long rink on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Ontario had lost its World Record title which it had held since 1971. Then in 2008 the rivers beat their own record which made the longest rink go to about 9.3-kilometres. The Rideau Canal still held the record for the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\". In 2013 the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail lost its record to the Lake Windermere Whiteway at Invermere, British Columbia, Canada.The length of the skating trail at The Forks changes each year, depending on river and ice conditions, although a concerted effort is made to make it as long as possible. In the winter of 2010/2011, conditions on The Assiniboine River made it impossible to safely create skating westward, so the path extended instead south on the Red River. Essentially, the water level and the weather at the time of freeze-up will impact the way the ice forms (see frazil ice, for example), how stable it will be, and how smoothly it can be made for skating. Much of the local river ice in Winnipeg in the winter of 2010/2011 was too rough to form a skating surface. There is also a skating trail made overland which is not impacted by river conditions. There are also walking and ski trails running parallel to the skating trail.\nWarming Huts: An Art + Architecture Competition on Ice is an open competition endorsed by the Manitoba Association of Architects. Started in 2010, the first iteration of the competition saw five local architects building outdoor structures to protect people from winter weather. In 2011, competition was opened up to international participants and included work by Frank Gehry's firm Gehry Partners.

It is the oldest urban area in Winnipeg, and is home to the city's commercial core, city hall, the seat of Manitoba's provincial government, and a number of major attractions and institutions.\nThe City of Winnipeg's official downtown boundaries are: the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline on the north, Gomez Street and the Red River on the east, and the Assiniboine River on the south. The western boundaries are downtown are irregular, following along a number of different streets, back lanes, and across properties.   Generally speaking, the western boundaries are rarely further west of Balmoral and Isabel Streets. In 2016, Canadian Geographic produced a map that generalize Winnipeg's downtown boundaries.Neighbourhoods in the downtown area include the Exchange District, Central Park, The Forks, and Chinatown. The downtown area is roughly three square kilometres. Winnipeg Square, Bell MTS Place, Portage Place, and the flagship store of the Bay are all located on the downtown section of Portage Avenue. On Main Street are Winnipeg's City Hall, Union Station, and the Manitoba Centennial Centre, which includes the Manitoba Museum, the Planetarium, the Centennial Concert Hall and the Winnipeg Railway Museum. Although over 60,000 people work downtown, only 13,470 people actually live in the Downtown area.There are several residential projects under construction on Waterfront Drive and in the Exchange District, and the residential population of the area is projected to increase substantially in the next few years.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\nThe Downtown Winnipeg Zoning By-Law defines the boundaries of the Downtown planning area, and several sectors within it. The downtown census area is slightly smaller, omitting a three-block extension at the north edge. There is also a significantly larger Downtown community area, used for Community Social Data Strategy for Winnipeg.\n\n\n=== Waterfront District ===\n\nThe Waterfront District is a newly emerging district located in the northeast corner of downtown Winnipeg. The area runs along the west bank of the Red River along the recently built Waterfront Drive and features Stephen Juba Park.\nThe Waterfront district has seen a number of residential construction projects since 2005.There are plans to extend Waterfront Drive further north, to connect it with the Disraeli Fwy. Developer Leon A. Brown is offering up to 12 properties for redevelopment in the area.Sunstone Boutique Hotels had an $11-million plan to build a three-storey, 67-room boutique hotel on what is now a gravel parking lot, along with a new casual-dining restaurant in the one-storey brick former Harbourmaster's building. The plans also involve construction of a public plaza area at the south end of the property.\n\n\n=== Central Park ===\n\nCentral Park is one of Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhoods with 13,755 people per square km according to Statistics Canada's 2001 Census.

          "I\u2019ve visited the mints in the United States and will definitely say this one was a step above. Our guide, Nathan, was so knowledgeable and the building itself was incredible. The processes are so fascinating, as are the various coins the mint produces.",
          "What a great tour with Nathan giving us the opportunity to learn so much about how coins are made and distributed throughout the country. The history of coins before long time ago and now we\u2019re explained and how they are all made.",
          "If you are ever in Winnipeg you must tour the Mint. We toured on a Saturday which meant the Mint is not in operation but our tour guide provided us with so much detail. Book in advance, try for a weekday to see it while it's running.",
          "The 45 min Tour is filled with interesting facts and figures. It is the perfect length of time and moves along quickly to keep everyone\u2019s interest no matter their age. Our group was quite large and a small microphone would have helped some people hear better but the guide did",
          "Tour guide did great job with mint tour and answering questions. Beautiful building that can be seen for miles. Make coins for lots of other countries including most colored coins. Purchased a set of uncirculated coins.",
          "The building is beautiful set on an expanse of green fields. Book a tour of the process. Your knowledgeable guide will walk you through the steps of creating your currency. Shop in the boutique after and pick up a investment coin or just a small gift of your experience. No cafe",
          "Love going to the coin exchange and giving newly minted decorative coins as economical gifts to my out of province and out of country friends.",
          "The original Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa makes some coins, but the one we visited in Winnipeg now glamorously turns out most of Canada's glittering money! That fact is evident in the approach to the building, where you drive along a curving avenue of flags of c.70-80",
          "You can tour the Royal Canadian mint, located on the outskirts of Winnepeg, with guides. We had a wonderful time seeing how the mint operated and then spent some of the mint's products in the shop located there. The mint, like many buildings in the city, is quite a beauty and",
          "This was a cool place. Leaning about how they make currency (coin) for 75 different countries! The tour was very reasonable, interesting and a fun hour. They have a great gift shop. However, no pictures allowed. Didn't know Canada had such an innovated system. They have glow in",

          "Book this tour in advance. Used Tapp Car from my hotel room.. This a wonderful tour about how coins were made. The flags outside represent all of the nations that relies on Canada for it's coinage. Tour is about an hour. One can marvel at the ingenious coins that are on display",
          "I didn't realize how little I know about our coins and the Canadian Mint. The tour was fabulous - we learned about the process in making and shipping coins, including those beautiful coloured ones that are in circulation or available for purchase as a collector's item. Did you",
          "You need to book this tour in advance, I believe. It was really interesting and our guide was excellent. You had to observe everything from a distance, of course, but that didn't detract from the experience. Now to return to the Mint in Ottawa!",
          "I went by myself as I had nothing doing and it was under $10. You get to see from above how all the coins are made! All the flags that fly outside- means that country's currency that is being minted! At the end you get to see a gold bar. I knew that it was going to be heavy but",
          "Great place for the coin collector or those curious about how coins are minted. Tours fill up quickly-call ahead. Sales of new coins on sight for the avid collector or a unique gift.",
          "We grew up quite close to the Royal Canadian Mint, but had never visited it. We had tried to to fit it in to recent visits to Winnipeg, but it never worked out until last week. This is a very educational tour where we learned that they make 21 million coins here per day for",

          "You know what, this was a pretty fun tour. I was surprised. But I learned a lot about how coinage (not paper money) is made. I also learned about Canada\u2019s unique contributions to minting coins. There wasn\u2019t a lot hands on parts of the tour...which makes a lot of sense. And there",
          "We arrived at an odd time without a reservation and ended up doing a self-guided tour. If you are interested in money, it's a neat place to visit. The staff were friendly, and they have a very nice gift shop with an assortment of collectible coins.",
          "Our group had a private tour at the mint. Our guide explained what happens at the mint. It is amazing to see how our Canadian money is made. The mint produces 15 million coins daily. The gift shop has every coin that the mint produces for sale.",
          "A must see. Staff are amazing and so helpful. Loved being able to see coins up close. Purchased some coins, so very happy with them. I always by on line through the Mint, but going and seeing them was a thrill.",

          "Our tour of the Mint was enjoyed by all of us. The guide was knowledgeable, well spoken, and humorous. Did you know all Canadian coins have a steel core? This is an easy way to separate our coins from American coins. Just use a magnet. The Mint stamps out coins for more",
          "I went in to get coin sets for Christmas gifts. A wide variety of coin sets at various prices for everyone. While there you can also get a brief view of the processing at a glass window. Worth a visit just to experience it",

          "What a fun place, very unexpected tour that was made interesting. You can see how coins are made and it is a fun family experience.",
          "What a great tour. You get to see coins being minted. When driving up you see all the flags for the countries that they produce coins for. They were minting coins for 4 or 5 different countries while I was there. You can actually see everything except the plating process.",
          "The mint produces coins for so many countries. We enjoyed the tour and seeing how the coins were made. Call ahead to register for the tour. No pictures allowed.",
          "Enjoyed the tour and seeing the money. The gold bar was interesting to see and hold. First time I had ever held a gold bar worth approximately $700,000 (at that times current market price of gold).",

          "Following a lengthy and complicated set of \"political discussions\" it was decided to locate the new Mint (the existing Mint in Ottawa was antiquated and too small). An \"added bonus\" associated with the new building was that it could more economically source raw materials from",

          "If you go, make sure you call ahead and book a tour, otherwise, you wander the gift shop with nothing to do. If you do take the tour, it costs $6/person and is about 45 minutes, but kinda boring. The guide takes you along a bunch of windows and beyond a locked door to explain",
          "If you're Canadian and want to see where your coins are made - this is the place to go. If you are in Winnipeg & have the time this is well worth the visit. You will enjoy your tour.",
          "This is where our coins are made ideas come alive and the design comes alive . From collectors coins to everyday dollars and cents this place make it all even our Olympic medals how cool is that. Tours are available .",
          "The mint has a nice gift shop with a wide range of coins. Staff are knowledgeable and and helpful. Tours are available providing the history of coin minting and views of the labs were coins from 75 countries are created.",
          "My visit at the Royal Canadian Mint located in Winnipeg was a great one. They produced coins for many countries in the world and one simple visit will help you understand why they have an outstanding reputation in the world.",
          "It was a good experience through and through. The best part was being able to hold a half a million dollar bar of gold in my hands and take pictures of it in the process.",
          "It was a little interesting and a tad boring. Would I go again, no, but it was worth going and seeing it once!",
          "interesting tour of to learn more about Canadian money and how it is made. Kids liked getting to pick up the gold bar. Great gift shop with special coins to purchase. Not crowded and tour guide was willing to take questions. The flags in front of the building were",
          "Interesting place to visit if just to go into the gift store area buying some coin sets which we did. You can also do tours if you like. Worth a visit!",
          "Very interesting tour of the facilities.... a lot on the process. Kids loved it too. There is a coin store on the premisses, and kids can lift a bar of gold.",
          "An interesting spot. It is very hands off since you are looking through glass windows. I was surprised to learn that the Mint makes currency for many other countries. This explained the lovely array of flags outside- one for each country for which currency is made.",
          "While we didn't have a lot of time to explore, we found that they had even less set up for exploration. The \"self-guided tour\", was essentially a walk way that overlooked the operations, with a few displays and TVs that were not operational. There was nothing much in the way",
          "Called to inquire about a guided tour, and was told the earliest was 1:30 pm due to school children booked for 11 am, but was offered that we could do our own self tour if we had wanted to, anytime after 11:30 am. The guided tour we were told; is really the exact same as",
          "A very worthwhile place to visit. Tours are informative and staff are very friendly. Try to go when the mint is operational Tuesday to Friday. Great gift shop for the coin lover .",
          "Tuesday-Friday is the time to go to this, unless you want to go and not see any machines running! Free admission and paid tours, but the tour area can be accessed for free.",
          "This mint does the coins for 95 countries. We got to see the entire process and have any questions answered by the guide. Very fun to press your own coin in a huge press. Watch out for for the \"bang\".",
          "Neat place to visit. The gift shop has lots of cool stuff, and you can pick up a bar of gold. The minting part is like an episode of \"How it's Made\" Very cool.",
          "You should probably drive to the Mint. The nearest bus stop is still a 10-15 minute walk away along a highway. We cut across the goose-occupied lawn to save time. Is it trespassing if you pay for the tour? The tour was short, but informative, and the guide answered all our",
          "During our last summer vacation my wife wanted to take our boys for a trip to the mint for a day out. While the cost of the tour was minimal (roughly 20$ for 4 of us) and the grounds and building amazing it felt that the staff member giving us the tour would rather be doing",
          "If you're visiting Winnipeg and you have some time, this is well worth a visit. We first 'saw' this on the TV show: The Amazing Race - Canada. When I got a chance to go to Winnipeg in September of 2015, for the first time, I wanted to go here. I called ahead and reserved a",

          "Been a long time, but was a field trip as a kid, what child doesn't want to see what appears to be an endless amount of money, was a great trip, if given the chance, will stop in again.",
          "The 45 minute tour is interesting and provides a lot of information on the history and background however it would have been nice to see the \"factory\" at work in the way of taking the raw material from coil to the developed coins.",
          "Great place to take the family. We went on a self guided tour, but before we went, the tour guide gave us a bit of info on the mint. Very pleased. Did not cost anything to see the mint on your own, however, we were there on a Saturday.",
          "My wife and I took the tour and it could have been done in a lounge somewhere. The young lady conducting the tour really knew what she was talking about however we went around coffee break and even though there really is nothing to see,there was no activity going on at all. An",

          "We stopped at the Mint to take a tour and look at the latest coins being produced. The tour was well done although every tour seemed to be very full. About 20-35 people in each group. It was interesting to see the rolls of steel that form our coinage and how they go through the",
          "After having driven past the Royal Canadian Mint since it was first built, we finally took the time to go for a tour of the facility. And I was very glad we did. It is advisable to call before you go to register for one of the tours. Upon arrival, you drive by many different",
          "This is a unique building and very accessible. The entry fee is very reasonable and inexpensive. The tour guide was entertaining and knowledgeable. It's a very interesting and easy to follow tour.",
          "Even though I visited on the weekend it was a great tour. The woman that took the tour was very friendly and happy to take questions and her knowledge was outstanding. Would be awesome to see during working hours however was not disappointed that I didn't see the machines",
          "That is a great museum, so many interesting things to learn about coins and its history. It is really fascinating and the guides are so helpful, giving so much information. Plus, they are very polite and reliable. You can't miss this experience!",
          "The Mint requires a tour, which is pretty inexpensive. The guides are great, and the information quick and informative. The gift shop has a nice mix of materials, and although the building is not new, it is still a good place to visit. Only coins are made at this mint, but oh so",
          "It was a surprise to see the beautiful entrance area and reception hall. The staff very well trained and polite. The guided tour was very informative.",
          "We tried so hard to get to Winnipeg to see the Mint before it closed at 4 pm on the Friday but we just missed out on the tour and had to wait until it opened again on Saturday. There are tours on Saturday but nothing is running. The tour guide was informative but it lacked",
          "I went on the 45 minute tour of the Mint and found it to be very interesting. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer all my questions. It was quite fascinating to see the facilities where Canadian (and many other countries' coins) are produced. The tour was",
          "We took the self guided tour, real nice to go at your own pace. Very interesting to read what's going on while watching the machines & employees in action through the viewing window. The fact that coins are made for many other countries was a surprise. The only",
          "We never thought we'd visit a mint again after our boring visit to the Denver mint. But, I can recommend this mint with its enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. The gift shop had a diverse selection of coins.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed the tour. It was well thought out and the guide (Michelle) was friendly and knowledgeable. We had a question she didn't know the answer to and looked it up for us at the end. I think it would be pretty boring for young children though.",
          "Tours of the mint are very interesting. The coins are made here in Winnipeg for many counties around the world. Great tour!",
          "The mint tour was clear and well organized. Presented a great deal of information about the modern minting process. Was impressed by the number of countries that this mint provides currency services for. The half hour tour was enjoyable and I'd advise booking in advance to",

          "It was an interesting tour, but they booked waaay to many people for ours. There was at least 20 people. The tour guide was pleasant and for the most part spoke loud enough. Now that we have been once, there will be no need to go again.",
          "Great place to visit for a quick 45 minute tour. The staff are very knowledgeable and we learned a lot of cool things about the Mint. Was able to see how money gets made during the tour which was really neat. The pavilion of flags you drive through on the way in was really",
          "Was really neat to see how coins are made! They had lots of coins to look at & also purchase. The coolest part was the huge 50 LB bar of gold, we got to lift it! It was worth some $500,000!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Mint. One piece of advice - check ahead of time for when the tours head out. We did not do that and ended up having to wait awhile.",
          "We stopped here because it was on our way back t o the hotel, it was about 3:30 pm & the mint closes at 5. We looked around for a few minutes and inquired about the tours. We (as seniors) only had to pay $5 each for a 45 minute tour. It was interesting to see how the coins are",
          "The mint is one of two you can visit in Canada. This one makes only coins [We found out the polymer money making mint doesnt give tours. :( ] It's not a bad drive, $15 for a family...so not expensive (though I swear all the other mints I have been to were free), its handicap",
          "We toured the mint while in Winnipeg for the World Cup. The tour was interesting, informative, entertaining. Well worth the stop if you are in Winnipeg!",
          "Definitely a worth while tour to take. We learned many interesting facts, like about the poppy quarter called the spy quarter. We also had a great tour guide, his name was Ben. Check out there coins to purchase, they make great gifts.",
          "I arrived at the mint expecting to wait a while for a tour and to shop in the gallery until a tour came available. When I approached the desk at about 11:15am I was told that the next tour was at 11:30 am but was fully booked and there were a few people waiting to make sure that",
          "To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when we decided to go to the Mint but after I got there I knew how wrong my perceptions were. It was cool to see the process used for making coins, stamping, etc, during the inexpensive tour we went on while there. Don't miss this if you",
          "We booked a guided tour before we arrived. We were able to see more of the operations with a tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and kept it fun for the young people also. Lifting the gold bar was a highlight. For coin collectors, there is a nice selection to buy. The",

          "I've taken a number of visitors to see the Mint, and have never been disappointed. Be sure to book a guided tour, as the tour guides are excellent and make the tour much more interesting than going through on your own and just reading the placards along the way. It's especially",
          "A very interesting and informative tour of the Royal Canadian Mint which opened in 1976. They produce coins for around 76 countries. On the day we visited they were making coins for Jamaica.",
          "Fun tour of the mint, and learning about how money is handled. Some of the most beautiful coins we have seen. With American money was a little more like Canadian. Time well spent on a rainy day.",
          "Interesting and informative. Tour is about 45 min and guide was great. Encouraged questions and kept things moving. Definitely call and make reservation. We were fortunate to get in last minute but some didn't and tours are about 1.5 hr apart. Certainly worth seeing",
          "Did you know that all the Canadian change is made here as well as coins etc for about 75 other countries. Tour was most interesting covering all aspects of the production....tour guide well informed and knowledgeable. Worth doing.",
          "My wife and I took the 45 minute tour of the Mint recently and were very pleased that we did. We got there a bit late for a tour that had left 5 minutes earlier and they let us join that tour which we were thankful for. There is a very reasonable admission charge for the tour.",
          "From the time we sighted the stunning building, we knew we were in for a different type of tour. Our tour guide, Brittainy, certainly knew her stuff and kept her cool.(how our coins are made,history,materials used,etc.) In the gift shop one can easily ring up a bill over one",
          "First of all, the building exterior and grounds themselves are very impressive and easy to walk and photograph. You drive down a driveway lined with all the flags of the nations that this facility creates money for. The building interior though is a little bland. Small",
          "My niece and I visited here when we were in Winnipeg. I highly recommend the tour as there really isn't anything else to do there. The price for the tour was reasonable ($6 for adults, $3 for youth) and the tour guide was very knowledgable.",
          "This was a great tour for the family which included a detailed description of the process in which coins are minted. The tour guide that we had did a great job interacting with the many children on the tour and still managing to make this interesting for the adults as well.",
          "We were not able to see the actual production of the coins coz the machines that time were off because there were no working employees. However, we still enjoyed the tour. Being able to hold the actual gold bar was one of the highlight for the kids.",
          "If you're a coin collector or just like to view the new and interesting coins available, then definitely check out the Royal Canadian Mint! Offers a boutique where you can browse the newly minted coins as well as take a tour of the facility (for a nominal charge of course!).",
          "This is something that hit my engineering soul, lots to learn from our currency. The guide was full of energy and gave us a great tour.",
          "really interesting tour of the operations of the mint. Disappointing that no pictures are allowed, but understandable! Had fun lifting the heavy solid gold bar. the manufacturing process for coinage is really fascinating, and the sheer volume overwhelming. I knew Canada did a",
          "We booked ahead, as advised, to visit the Royal Canadian Mint. The tour guide related interesting facts and dates about the coins. How shiny all those new pennies gleamed! We could hold a bar of gold! It was chained on and the security guard stood watch.",
          "The tour of the mint is truly amazing for those who have an interest in the production of international as well as our own Canadian coins. Although very interesting it is not geared toward the very young--though they are welcome. The gift store offers a great selection of coins,",
          "The tour guide was very knowledgeable and could be easily heard. Much like the U.S. Mint, it is difficult to really see the money being made, but it was interesting to watch. If possible, call ahead for a reservation time for the tour.",
          "Very worthwhile, economical and best 45 minute tour for very long time. Educational and a insight to world class manufacturing of coinage.",
          "Took our 6 and 8 year old grandchildren and the tour and mint were interesting for a short visit but certainly not a \"must do \" experience. Tour was well done and lasted approximately 45 mins. Nice gift shop to purchase special coins.",
          "Our tour guide did a very nice job - if I were to go again I would try to go during the week so we could have seen the machinery running. It was very interesting.",
          "Very interesting tour of how coins are made. Liked the gift store as well as the tour. This tour takes less than an hour and is quite reasonable in price as well.",
          "We headed to the Mint because it was meet the artists who designed currency imagery day. It was interesting to hear about their process and see their work. Hopefully this will be an annual event.",

          "The 45 minute tour was very informative and interesting. Our tour guide, Ben, was quite entertaining. We were there in the summer, and able to walk in and get on the next tour. I would recommend calling in advance during to get on the tour list during school months, as there",
          "If you have any interest in money, this is a place you should visit. One of two mints in Canada there is a lot going on to see. The tour is 45 minutes long, but the gift shop is cool to look through as well. Probably spend a bit over an hour there and that would be enough.",
          "A fun stop, they do offer tours on Sunday but aren't making coins so it kind of defeats the purpose. You can see the machines and hold the 23lb gold bar whether you take the tour or not.",
          "Interesting tour- great gift shop! Was surprisingly quiet over the lunch hour. Apparently, there are scheduled tour times so do check their web site before you go and ask when you are most likely to see the production line in action.",
          "If you want to know how money is made this is the place. You get to see the factory and how and when money is made before installation. Really cool for the kids! You get to also pick up a one million dollar gold bar and take pictures with family! :)",
          "Took the kids and even they were impressed, from the history of the mint to the statistics the questions abound. Take a few hours off to see it -- Maybe bring home a souvenir",
          "I visited the Mint in the springtime, Winnipeg was still covered in snow. I toured the Mint without a guide and it was great to see the coin-making process. The halls are lined with huge windows where you can watch the coins being made and stamped in the factory. There was a",
          "fun to see that little metal commodity come to life! Some interesting facts, you probably did not know...must visit.",
          "The Mint is well worth a tour. The staff is very knowledgeable and answers questions well. To see how our coins are minted and handled makes us aware of the many precautions that affect the manufacturing. Also learned about the many foreign coins made here in Winnipeg.",
          "Great place to visit when in Winnipeg. It is a bit far away, so, with a public transit it will take you at least one hour with quite bit a walk to get there. Taxi is about $20 to downtown. Royal Mint is really great place well organized for visits. We took a guided tour and",
          "I went to the Mint last year. It was very amazing and surprising!! I tried to make a coin. In winter, maybe it's a good time for your children!!!",
          "This is an excellent and informative place to visit-- even the gift shop, which sells very high quality collector coins, is informative. You get a tour of the facility at a comfortable pace with a knowledgeable guide. The best part is watching the mint in action as millions of",
          "Gained a good knowledge of how coins are made, and they have tours in both English and French. Photo taking is not allowed, but then it's just big machineries in operation, so there's nothing interesting to take a picture of. I'm sure only good, honest people can work there",
          "I was skeptical, but this was one of the most fun places we visited! The tour guides do a great job making a could be boring thing into something really awesome! :)",
          "Arrived a little early for the tour. There were enough activities and displays to keep us busy. My husband went ahead and did the self guided tour on the second level as well. The women showing the items for sale were very knowledgeable and friendly. Wish I would have bought one",
          "The mint was great but the tour guide lacked the honesty and personality for the job. Other wise very interesting place to visit.",
          "I had never been- so felt it was long overdue. I think you have to go when there is some sort of production work going on. We were there when there was nothing happening. It was \"adequate\". i may have to give it a second chance.",
          "Interesting stop for my mother-in-law from Ukraine. She enjoyed the tour. I have been before and enjoyed the tour.",
          "we took a tour of the site and got some really interesting information about how money is made in Winnipeg, what surprised me that they are making coins for many other countries",
          "Couldn't resist the opportunity to stop here. The grounds and the building are outstanding and beautiful. The big lake out front has a huge fountain in the middle and the grounds are covered with hundreds of Canada Geese. This is a must stop when visiting Winnipeg.",
          "Learned a lot about coin minting, and the guide was excellent... very knowledgeable. A beautiful building with many fascinating areas.",
          "On our trip to Winnipeg, we finally visited the mint. This is where they make coins for all over the world, I don't believe this is where they print the bills, just coins. There were some interactive displays on the main floor for my 9 year olds, but through the tour they were",
          "There are only two places in Canada minting money - Ottawa and Winnipeg. You can see the actual place making money. And sometimes they displace the real goldbar, and you can touch and lift it. But don't try to take it. :-)",
          "We went on a Sunday. We did a self tour but it would have been much better if there was activity in the Mint. I will go back during a week day.",
          "I liked the fact they have handicapped parking close to the door. It was an interesting experience which travelers should take the time to visit. There was nothing that I didn't like about the mint.",

          "We went on Canada day for the free admission and activities. It was really busy and we did not get to see or hear what we wanted so we booked a tour and went back. We had a fantastic tour guide who was interesting and entertaining as well as good with the kids. We used coupons",
          "We enjoyed our tour of the mint. Very fascinating. There were some children on the tour who asked good questions. The guide was knowledgeable and interesting. Well worth the visit. Amazing how many other countries that they make their coins!",
          "There was a lot that I didn't know about our coins and how they are made. This is a great tour for both adults and children. Know going in that you don't get really close to where the coins are made (for obvious reasons) you view everything from above and no pictures are",
          "Spend an hour at the Mint in the 'Peg - worth your while. The 45 minute tour is very informative, call in advance to book your space - no waiting on arrival. Group size was a bit too big, hard to hear the guide sometimes over the chatting kiddies. Age appropriate might be 6-7",
          "I had lived in Winnipeg for almost 20 years before moving out West but had never visited the Mint. The tour was very affordable and informative. My husband and I enjoyed it immensely. Not a good fit for young children but for those over 10 would find it interesting as well.",
          "There is no doubt the tour was informative and educational but it was not much different than reading an article about coins production. Though some of the machines were working, they were so far that you rely on the information of tour guide. It would be much better if we could",
          "Eric the tour Guide was good. Children too young to understand anything about the tour made continual chatter.. .and parents were not polite enough to move them away from the speaker/guide. I recommend a note be added \"Not recommended for children under five years of age.\" The",

          "The mint was a fun and educational place to visit. You can see people working at the mint producing coins. The whole tour will take you about a good hour to hour and a half. They also have a gift and coin shop. The July tour had a $500,000 gold bar that you could pick up",
          "Book in advance to make sure you get in on a tour. We found the tour interesting, a bit simpler than we some how thought but still enjoyable. Still an enjoyable, reasonably priced couple hours. What I found really interesting was the statistics of what they can produce and",
          "It was interesting seeing how coins are produced at the Mint. We had a young interpreter who guided us through sections of the Mint . It was a short tour with a lot of information. I think the tour would benefit with more interactive stations, for the kids. It was a very",

          "Nice day out. Lots of things to keep the kids interested. Our kids loved hearing about the money they love to spend.",
          "This visit was impromptu but I did not regret it. As I drove up to the building, it reminded me of buildings in science fiction movies. Once inside, I was amazed at what goes on behind closed doors. The Mint, besides making all of our Canadian coins, also makes coins for many",
          "This place is a complete snore. Even if your interested in the process of how money is made its still very boring. The tour is over priced and you don't actually get to see much more than you would if you didn't bother to go on the tour. The hour I spent here would have been",
          "This had not been near the top of our 'to do' list whilst visiting Winnipeg for 3 days, but our local friends wanted to take us there so we went. It was a very worthwhile visit and the 90 minutes did not drag at all. The Mint makes coins for so many countries and the story of",

          "Was very suprised to learn about what all the mint does. Our tour guide was entertaining, but not in a good way for her. ALso some of the people we toured with were amazing with the questions they asked. I was embarassed to be an American. Besides that it is pretty cool.",
          "This is one of Winnipeg\u2019s more unusual attractions and definitely worthwhile for a one hour visit. The mint is located just outside Winnipeg proper in a semi-rural location that allows for good views of the very attractive mint building. The best place to get a good picture is",
          "We were a bit rushed but we felt that we had to have a look at the Mint while we were in Winnipeg. We flew through our tour and it was very interesting and informative. I had no idea how many countries have their coins produced here! I loved being able to buy coins that were",

          "We really enjoyed the guided tour despite the fact that it was the weekend and coin production was not currently in progress. If possible try to go on a weekday so you can see the action. Nonetheless, we learned a lot of interesting facts on the 45 minute tour and were able to",

          "I grew up in Winnipeg and remember going to the Mint on a school trip. Today we had the place to ourselves and while it was a weekend day, we were still able to go on a tour and walk through the process. I would recommend that all the TV screens showing the process be",

          "We went to the Mint on a Saturday, and they were short staffed, so they let us go on an unguided tour for free. It was very interesting to see how money was made, and it's amazing how many countries we make money for. Nice gift shop as well.",
          "This was an enjoyable half day out. The mint has a pleasant outlook. There's plenty of hands on activities in the gift shop area to keep the kids entertained while waiting for the next tour. The place has been set up to cater for tours and plenty of thought has been put into",
          "The Mint is not more than a short tour to see how money is made. It is interesting that this happens in Winnipeg, and that Winnipeg makes the money for so many countries, but, this is pretty boring for young children and other than the tour, there is not much to do.",

          "As a coin collector this was an obvious place for me to visit! It was amazing to see the coin manufacturing process and the displays were very clear. It's a great shame that the British Royal Mint in Llantrisant does not do similar tours! The tour is very good value for money",

          "On our way out of town we decided to stop in at the mint. We weren't sure if it would be worth it but we were pleasantly surprised. We had no reservations and a tour started at our arrival and we were the only ones. Our tour guide Phil was great and extremely knowledgeable",
          "Tour doesn't take a long time, but it's an interesting process to see. Since they run 24/7 during the week, there's always something going on. And how often can you see real Olympic medals?",
          "Our tour guide, Justin, and the other people working, were so knowledgeable. He also had a good strong voice that carried, so no one had any trouble hearing. The Mint itself is a unique place to visit, being one of only two in Canada.",

          "We had a great tour of the Mint in Winnipeg. They have tours 7 days a week but you need to go Monday to Friday to see the machines in production. Definitely go there while you're in Winnipeg.",
          "I have been on a tour at the mint every two or three years. I bring my family members when they visit us here in Winnipeg. This time, the tour was exceptional. We had a very enthousiastic tour guide by the name of Roxanne. She was very informative and kept everyone their feet",
          "it was July 1, so machines did not \"work\" but there was a lot of infos on boards at each step. Nice also with children",

          "We booked the tour in advance over the phone. The tour was very entertaining. It is amazing to see so many coins that are being minted. Even though tours are available during the weekends, minting is done only during the weekdays. The tour is an unique experience. I will",
          "That's the least you will learn when visiting this amazing place. Watch how Canadian coins and those of more than 70 other countries are made. The tour takes you from the design stage to the packaged and ready to ship product. Well explained by the tour guide and sometimes",
          "The total time for the tour and a visit to the gift shop takes about 1 hour. The tour consisted of walking along a glass enclosed balcony overlooking a work area and a guide telling you about the machines.It did not even look like the machines were working but because we were",
          "We've never been to a mint. Who knew they make coins for 75 different countries, plus blanks for USA coinage. Excellent tour guide (Phil) explained every step of the process and patiently answered all our questions. Suggest calling ahead to schedule your tour time if you are",

          "An upper level with large glass viewing areas and informational panels overlooks various mint operations. It was quite neat to watch the entire process. My six-year-old son also enjoyed stamping his own coin (fun but a little pricey at $3 IMO) and testing the weights of",
          "Fun and unique and interesting to see of course but not as interesting as the one in Ottawa because they don't make the special coins. But still really cool.",
          "Not every city has its own mint. We had overseas relatives come to visit Winnipeg and we wanted to show them something unique. The tour at the Mint was a great event. Everyone who lives in Winnipeg should see it.",
          "Take the tour and find out! This place makes coins for countries all over the globe! Right here! In little ol' Winnipeg. . who knew?? Well you do now!",
          "Not a whole lot going on at the mint, although we did go when there was no coin production. We didn't have to pay for the guided tour, which is good, because the gentleman working at the gift shop essentially said the guided tour is just a staff member who has memorized the",

          "It's an inexpensive place to visit that allows you to see coins being made. Government building well set up for viewing with grounds that are amazing. Worth visiting once just to see the procedure and perhaps get inspired if you are a budding coin collector.",

          "Seeing the process of minting was interesting - but we felt a little disconnected from the process and there wasn't too much else to see or do. Nor really surprising, I guess - it is just what it is.",

          "It is located outside the city and is about 20 minutes drive from downtown but well worth the time. We enjoyed the scales which showed how much we would be worth if we were made of silver, gold and platinum. Now need a magic wand to convert us to either of those!!! :) It is",
          "We spent a few hours touring the Winnipeg Mint. Actually the girls spent more time in the gift shop. Even though we had reservations for a tour..it seems their tour quite quit that morning. So we took a self guided tour that is above the work area. You get to look down on",

          "This tour was well worth the $5. The guide was upbeat, hands-on examples were shown, machines were running, and people were working. (If you went on a weekend you would miss a lot of the action if no one is working.) The tour lasted about 30-40 minutes and was very informative.",
          "Well worth the time and $5 for the tour. I am not a coin collector but the tour allowed me to appreciate the change in my pocket. I also visited the Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa and prefer the one in Winnipeg.",
          "First of all, the mint's building style is facinating. It looks like it is made of copper! And inside, they have this swimming pool looking fountain. They have a nice gift shop and some displays, including a really heavy gold bar! The guided tours are wonderful and the staff are",

          "The tour of the Winnipeg Mint is interesting, but it does not cover very much ground. During our tour, the workers were on their coffee break, so we did not see much action on the floor. We still enjoyed ourselves. The building and grounds are very pretty, and we saw a lot of",
          "As other reviewers have said, make sure to call ahead just to check the tour schedule. We did, arrived about 15 minutes early and had just enough time to take the tour. My wife and I both enjoyed the tour, the history of the mint and especially seeing how they process some of",

          "We visited the Royal Canadian Mint in June 2005. It was an awesome way to begin the weekend. The cost was minimal and the tour guides were very informative. Great for all ages.",
          "We arrived at the mint at 10 am and found that the next tour was at 11:30 am. We signed in for that tour. There are displays to look at and a gift shop to visit. The tour started with a short (3 minute or so) video. Our guide was very informative and was able to competently",

        "wiki": "Plantasia is a large public hothouse, located in the Parc Tawe retail park, Swansea, Wales that opened in 1990.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nPlantasia exhibits a wide range of tropical plants, and insects, reptiles, and fish.\nThe glasshouse contains two climate zones: Tropical with a rainforest, and Arid.  The collection includes over 5,000 plants, many of which are extinct from their natural habitat. Plant types include bananas, giant bamboo, paw paw and collections of ferns and cacti.Along with the plants, there is supporting life including crested geckos, tarantulas, red-bellied piranha, koi carp, green-winged macaws, parakeets, lorikeets, chameleons, bearded dragons and a Burmese python. Additionally, Plantasia houses critically endangered cotton-top tamarins and critically endangered Kleinmann's tortoise.In 2011 Plantasia added the Rainforest Hut to its exhibits. The hut was built using the same basic principles used by forest tribes, and with forest materials such as bamboo, palm leaves, and clay, and shows how rainforest tribes live in harmony with nature.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nPlantasia was used as a filming location for the Doctor Who episodes \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (on 21 December 2007) and \"Cold Blood\" (on 13 November 2009).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "This is a great place, so much to see and do. Took children and they really enjoyed. The place is very interesting. Reasonable price. Would recommend.",
          "I came with 3 children aged 12,9 and 5. The rainforest plants were amazing and it had a real rainforest feel, however I think there needs to be more added, for example interaction with the animals and also more animals added, maybe there could be a bird enclosure where everyone",
          "At Plantasia you walk around an indoor rainforest. The different plants and animals were very interesting and educational. The centre is very well laid out as well, taking you on a path over bridges and through tunnels so you see everything. There are a few animals on the way,",
          "Nice staff members and a really warm welcome but I'm afraid there just isn't enough to do to justify the price. We went around twice and we're in there 55 minutes with a three year old. Perhaps in the small room with chipmunks you could have things for the children to do that",
          "We bought a Wowcher deal which was a family ticket for \u00a312 and for that I don\u2019t think it was too bad. Full price would have been \u00a321 and had we paid that I would have been annoyed. The children really enjoyed seeing the animals and plants and searching for the different leaves",
          "Way too bloody expensive for a 30 minute experience! Wouldn't even bother considering going again unless the price dropped a decent margin.",
          "Very disappointing and not worth the money. Most of the animals were in hiding. Sad to see litter thrown down the sides of some enclosures. The lady doing the show, tell and hold sessions just stood there saying nothing. I asked if she could tell my 7-year-old niece a few",
          "This is the first time I have been since Plantasia has been refurbished. I took my class for a visit. I have to say that the place has hugely improved. All the staff are much more enthusiastic and were great with my students. Plus the place itself has improved and the animal",
          "Took my 3 year old nephew her today, he was 3 last week and now the price has shot up. \u00a312.00 for both of us. Plantasia is nice thing for plants but sadly most of the animals are in hiding, totally natural but no good for a little boy and the snake wasn't there at all.",
          "I took my two granddaughters who are both two one rainy Saturday, they thoroughly enjoyed, especially as on every hour they bring out different creatures so the children can handle them!! Great to see lizards, giant spiders etc up close!! We spent a good hour wandering through",
          "Took our son for his birthday and we were there a whole of 20 mins, butterfly part no longer exists which is disappointing hardly no animals mainly critters which you can\u2019t really see as their hidden couldn\u2019t access story room as there was a school there which we were not",
          "First time to visit here since the refurbishment it was ok. There are a lot more animals to what I remember form before. Its some where you pop for an hour or two rather than a full day out. It's was rather busy as it was half term but the kids enjoyed doing the Halloween trail.",
          "Had a fantastic night with a friend and our teenagers being scared out of our wits. Don\u2019t want to give too much away but we had lots of different frights and we screamed non stop. Definitely worth a visit and will be returning for next years Halloween event!",
          "Very busy (was August), went with my two boys, took about 30mins max to walk through (and that was stop/start as busy). Overall quite impressive but far to expensive for such a short exhibit. If you can get discount/vouchers then it\u2019s worth a look",
          "Last time we went to Plantasia was before it's refurbishment. As they have Meerkats there, we made a plan to revisit. What a difference! Well laid out and plenty of interactive displays. There is a wide variety of animals there and they all looked well cared for. We attended all",
          "We came to visit on the weekend and while it was lovely and the refurbishment looks great, \u00a321 for a family is expensive for what you get. You\u2019d struggle to spend longer than an hour in there I just think there\u2019s not enough to see and do to justify that price. A lovely haven",
          "We visited Plantasia today, for the first time since it\u2019s refurbishment. I\u2019m happy to say we were not disappointed. I think you really had to experience it beforehand to truly appreciate the massive improvements that have been made. Gone was the dated decor and to be honest",
          "Took my grandkids for an afternoon out. I was expecting a lot more for the \u00a37 per adult and \u00a35 per child. There wasn't enough in the place to occupy my kids and the toilet facilities legt alot to be desired. I wont be going back.",
          "For the money paid, I didn't feel there was that much to see. It would have been nice to be told before I bought my ticket that there were refurbishments going on and so not all the animals were viewable. I was looking forward to the parrots. The staff were not that friendly and",
          "Just a few minutes walk from Swansea city centre you can find this pyramid of glass containing a host of interesting plants and a small variety of animals to entertain you for an hour or 2. We were lucky enough to be around at feeding time and have a close encounter with a",
          "It was a lovely visit but it only took us an hour to go around twice. Staff were very good. Not enough toilets though.",
          "A big improvement on what it used to be. The children enjoyed the tortoises, meerkats and reptiles and enjoyed holding and touching snakes and a bearded dragon. The staff at reception weren\u2019t very welcoming but the staff with the animals were lovely. It\u2019s quite a small venue",
          "We visited Plantasia a couple of days ago, one adult a 6 year old, and 3 year old and a 7 week old baby and it was fantastic. The entire facility was designed to follow the path so the children can\u2019t get lost inside and wonder off looking at all the different plants and animals.",
          "Came here on a rainy day. The place is more about plants than animals but has a good selection such a meerkats and caimans. There are also daily handling sessions. On the day of our visit there were a tortoise and corn snake to handle. I enjoyed handling both of them as they",
          "My 12yr son uses a wheelchair & normally places like this are pointless for him. NOT this one,he could get around the whole place & see exhibits through the glass walls. He got to hold a Giant Snail & Bearded Dragon. The staff are so friendly and helpful. They didn't see the",
          "Had a great afternoon here.. haven't been here in 14yrs and is so much better than it used to be.. staff seemed very happy and the place was clean and tidy considering the amount of kids that were running around the place.. nice to see some animals there and interaction with",
          "Today we paid a visit to the recently refurbished Plantasia. The staff were very welcoming and couldn\u2019t do enough for us, they even allowed my son to feed the spiders! The animal handlers were very encouraging and didn\u2019t push my son to handle the snakes, lizard or tortoise.",
          "This place is so much better now they have had the revamp! The exhibits are much more informative and there are a number of interactive things dotted around which the kids loved. The new cafe is lovely and the coffee and pizza are good value for money and delicious. It took us",
          "Plantasia has been renovated very well and is a very attractive area. They have made the best of a relatively small space. They now have some animals, including meerkats which are always popular. I thought \u00a35 was very reasonable for over 60's especially as parking is free. I",
          "We have visited this attraction a few times in the past, a new company now run it and they have invested in infrastructure and attractions. It is much improved and luckily they have retained many of the knowledgable / helpful staff. The snack area has also been upgraded and is",
          "This was our first visit to plantasia. It cost us just under \u00a320 for 2 adults and 2 children, which i thought was reasonable - until i went inside to see what was on offer. They have snakes in vivariums which were tiny and not suitable. It took us 30 minutes to walk around",
          "Visited as a family of four. Paid \u00a321 for a family ticket through gritted teeth. Has been renovated recently and the added on walkways and bridges were a nice addition. Also enjoyed the meerkats. The pond and waterfall are still there from before and make a nice feature.",
          "After we managed to find the way (lots of other people also tried the wrong entrance) we paid the reasonable entry fee and went in. There is a good range of plants in a warm, humid environment. The attraction is spread over several levels with a long curved ramp making access",
          "First time my husband and I have been there since we were young. Firstly we went into the cafe where we ordered a pizza each (we brought a packed lunch for my young son). After waiting 20 minutes a gentleman came over and explained he \u201cdidn\u2019t know where the lady who makes the",
          "My wife and I brought took our two grandchildren (4 & 2) to this attraction on a wet Sunday afternoon. The entrance fee was quite reasonable for the number of things to see and do. It was amazing just how much has been crammed into such a small area, but saying this it is well",
          "\u00a319 to walk around , look at a few plants, snakes, spiders etc in small glass boxes, very hot in there, didn't see any staff. the meeker-cats tunnel got full of children and ended up with everyone pushing in the tunnel which scared my little granddaughter. could of walk around",
          "Hardly any animals and the ones I wanted to look at weren\u2019t there! All the plants were dead. Not very educational as only a small fact on each animal/plant. Unfortunately I wouldn\u2019t recommend or go again",
          "Visited Plantasia today with my 10 month old, his eyes were everywhere. It\u2019s definitely worth a look. They\u2019ve recently undergone a makeover. I think the \u00a37 entrance fee is worth the price for a couple of hours wandering round. Animals look well cared for and there\u2019s lots of",
          "Took my 9 year old grandson just after the re-opening, staff were friendly and knowledgeable and were walking round with tortoises for the children to hold. As for the rest, interesting layout but I was expecting more as even walking slow, we had seen all in about an hour. Not",
          "Started off with a visit to the cafe for lunch which was surprisingly empty. And after seeing the menu its not hard to see why. There was nothing on there really that the children could order, The only childrens meal we could see was a toasty which doesnt really appeal to kids,",
          "We were excited to come back to plantasia I\u2019ve been heading there since it first opened so hearing it\u2019s been done out new walkways and exhibits we headed in. \u00a319 for 2 adults & child ok more than we thought. We slowly headed around with our 4 year old who was bouncing to see",
          "We spent a pleasant hour and a half at plantasia (although 20 mins of that was spent deciding which animal toy to buy in the shop!). Reasonably priced with pleasant staff. Our toddler daughter especially liked the chipmunks and meerkats. There's also a nice cafe for a snack.",
          "The girlfriend was in work and a friend was visiting from Bristol with her three kids (all under 10). I was looking after the girlfriend ms two daughters so we all went here as the weather was not all that good. It was busy but we didn\u2019t have to queue to get in. Price wise,",
          "Plantasia has been renovated at a cost of \u00a31m+. Visited with our grandchildren. Nice new walkways, lots of interesting small animals to see, and in some cases hold & touch. Small restaurant area & shop.",
          "Haven't been to Plantasia for several years and so it was great to attend the re-opening weekend. As before, a great selection of tropical and desert plant-life, with numerous animals dotted around the enclosure - including terrapins, pythons, lizards, caimans, chipmunks,",
          "We could never get our 5 year old grand daughter to leave the old place. On one occasion she was still playing on the drums just before closing times. Today we were there for approximately 30 mins and she wanted to leave.",
          "We visited Plantasia yesterday (Saturday 13th April) when it reopened after a major refurbishment. Pleased to see that it was very busy, lots of children enjoying themselves around the walkways, bridges and tunnels. Plenty of information about the diverse plant life in the",
          "We visited on December 29th, 2018 - Me, my husband, our 2-yr old and parents in law. Small in size, but a perfect size for a 2yr old's attention span! Also, excellently cared for. Whilst we were there, my father in law spotted that the monitor lizard had escaped her cage. The",
          "We went to Plantasia for something to do & enjoyed seeing the meerkats, different plant species, birds, reptiles and fish. It was quiet and interesting. We probably spent under an hour there because it is quite small, but inexpensive and entertaining if you enjoy wildlife and",
          "This unusual glasshouse on Parc Tawe looks impressive enough but, despite the efforts of whoever manages it, it somehow seems a bit tired and dreary. The scruffy-looking macaws said it all. Our grandchildren never really got excited about many of the rather tired and",
          "bit boring plants looked scruffy, maybe the wrong time of year (sept) few animals of interest, cheap enough entry, no caf\u00e9 for tea and cake for the grand children.",
          "We went to see Plantasia many years ago, and returning to the area with an additional family member (our little lad) we decided to visit again. Entry was cheap and staff helpful, but the place is a lot smaller and, frankly, less interesting that it was all those years before. We",
          "Torrential rain all day forced us to find indoor activities. We went to Plantasia. It's a nice little place but it doesn't keep you busy for that long. We had a good look at everything and did some stuff in the craft area and we were still only there a bit more than an hour.",
          "This place is great! \u00a34 and you get to see lots of tropical plants, have very pretty walk all around. AND! There are animals too! Meerkats and tortoises in the entrance, koi and terrapin in the main pond, a few well stocked fishtanks, chipmunks, tarantulas, a chameleon, poisen",
          "We arrived and found the small venue and the entrance price was reasonable. Lady on desk was polite and talked to me as I\u2019m blind. The guy on the desk explained a quiz to our son and we went exploring. Great tropical forest with ample plants. Meerkats and various lizards,",
          "Had a fun afternoon with my daughter and grandson looking at loads of different plants and small animals. Completition to do, colouring and rubbings as activities",
          "It's not very big and doesn't take a lot of time to explore. Nevertheless there is interesting flora and fauna collection. Good for rainy days",
          "Visited here with a friend & 4 children between us (2x5 year olds+ 2x2 year olds) we bought a family ticket for \u00a313 odd and went straight in. However, after no more than 20 minutes, we had seen every plant/flower/fish & bird there was to see. They no longer have the buttery room",
          "Very good place to go not a lot too but well worth going. When we went there was no cafe it was being modernised. It was only 3.90 per adult to get in well worth it. They had little animals to view. Massive amount of parking",
          "Never been here before. And have always wondered what it would be like inside. I wasn\u2019t that impressed if I\u2019m honest. Was really small. Price for myself & daughter was \u00a37. So not too expensive i guess. I wouldn\u2019t visit again, now that I\u2019ve seen it. Will say though, my 6 year",
          "We've been past this so many times over the years we thought we'd give it a try while it was raining this weekend. It was a nice visit, and it is well maintained. It has a nice pond in the middle and some nice plants. There are some small animals that are nice to see but some",
          "Neither great nor that bad. Ive been here a few times over the years and it's pretty much the same each time. It's a little shabby but it's also educational, great for young children and a chance to see plants that you don't see ordinarily unless you live in a rain forest. If",
          "Brilliant little oasis of calm hidden in Swansea. Meerkats a joy to be hold! Well worth a visit. No restaurant as it\u2019s being refurbished.",
          "This little botanical garden was undergoing renovations when I visited. It is small and quaint, but lovely. It will not fill a day, but has enough to entertain you for an hour or so. They were in the process of building a meerkat exhibit, which would be a great addition to the",
          "I visit Plantasia regularly with my grandchldren but we try to visit when there is an activity on. Yesterday there was a 'Beast Creator' show in the Animal Zone which was excellent. The children were able to touch and hold bugs and reptiles and learnt a lot about them. I'd like",
          "My main issue with this attraction was its setting in relation to its surroundings, which at the time were shabby. I visited again earlier this week and the area has undergone redevelopment. Parking is better, access is easier, it's been spruced up and it's all the better for",
          "Went there expecting to see some plants... and did. Saw some animals too... that unexpected. It\u2019s a good place if you to see some plants.",
          "Plantasia isn't very big but my two boys really enjoyed it and we ended up staying a nearly two hours here. It is in need of a refurb but saying that it's still a lovely attraction that is also very educational. You get to see examples of both rain forest and Mediterranean flora",
          "We loved it! The kids loved it! It\u2019s educational & fun. Reasonably priced too. Really enjoyable experience",
          "Its sad to say but plantasia has gone down hill; its desperately in need of a refurb and some money spent on it; the staff are lovely but the infrastructure needs help",
          "Late October 2017 we had a rare opportunity to visit Swansea and take our little grandson out, he was so excited to see the monkeys - advertised in the current 2017 - 2018 Edition of \"Visit Swansea Bay\" & November - December 2017 \"What's On In Swansea\". Monkeys are his favourite",
          "Not a bad place to go if you're looking for some where to visit for an hour or so the children enjoyed seeing the animals/reptiles good to go if raining as all indoors and not expensive so I'd say worth a visit but don't expect too much .",
          "With lots of wild animals(snakes, baby tortoises ,terrapins and fish) it's the perfect day out for the family!",
          "Took all of 10 minutes to go round; almost nothing to see or do - a real letdown. Half of it was blocked off",
          "Have been to Plantasia a few times, and I can honestly say that the idea of the place is good. But I think it should be bigger to make it a real tourist attraction, sort of feels like you pay your money, go in walk round a bit, see the plants, birds, fish and monkeys (which of",
          "Sadly I have to agree with others who have recently reviewed Plantasia in saying that it has become very tired and dated and is in much need of updating and revamping. Was sad to see that the monkeys have gone and also the carp. There could be so many things that could be done",
          "We visited on the 18th August whilst holidaying in the area. My children aged 8 and 12 really enjoyed it although my daughter was disappointed as there were no monkeys. However that aside, they enjoyed looking at all the creatures in the tanks. I loved looking at all the plants.",
          "I visited today with my son and Granddaughter- having last visited years ago. It has to be said it has fallen on hard times- no monkeys, butterfly house now has some small parrots in it plus one large parrot. Frogs, insects, snakes and fish- whole place looks fairly unloved",
          "We visited Plantasia today to go to the Dino4hire event. The event and Plantasia are great. There's a lot of building work going on at the mo, so it is fab to find Plantasia open. The children love it and find all the flora and fauna there brilliant. Thank you x",
          "Surprisingly interesting with plenty to see. It's not massive, it probably takes around an hour, but is really cool. The aviary with squawking parakeets flying freely about was a particular highlight. Lovely chameleon in the animal section.",
          "Haven't been here since I was a lad, now a father I thought what better than to treat the kids to an afternoon of fun and learning. Animals are amazing and well looked after. My absolute favourite has to be the tortoises, I want one. Lots to do and rangers to help! Perfect for a",
          "We looked at the website prior to visiting and were aware of the works going on before we arrived. The entrance is just a desk and the girl on the desk wasn't very friendly just took our money and didn't even tell us which way to go. Inside it's basically a large greenhouse and",
          "I've been here many times both as a couple and with children and it's always a great time. Be sure to explore it all as there's lots to see around every corner :)",
          "Although there isn't a great deal to do there, it's a lovely place to visit when you have nothing else to do. It's not expensive and the kids can see and learn about different creatures and plants. It's a nice place - but does need more!",
          "Went today Amazon rain forest with Dave from previous shows absolutely fantastic, a must to book in advance Dave loves the children explained everything the children live him what an hour well spent go all the time mostly twice to see it as I have 4 grandchildren and take two",
          "Absolute rip off! Didn't see anything except some poor animals/fish in dirty tanks. Staff rude when I said we didn't see monkeys anywhere!!",
          "We enjoyed our visit and the granchildren did the quiz. I had researched Plantasia online before our visit and particularly chosePlantasia because our grandson likes monkeys. Very disappointed to find NO MONKEYS. 2 had died and the last one sent to the monkey sanctuary. Please",
          "Visited here with our two children ... A great facility with fantastic potential but left feeling they could have done a bit more ... It's old hat to do a few quizzes etc ... how about some electronic interaction for the children / visitors ....",
          "We visited Plantasia as we where on holiday locally. it seemed like a lovely place from what we saw online, we understood there was building works going on nearby but decided to go and have a look for future days out. We left there feeling quite sad about the state of the",
          "We decided to visit as there was nothing else to do in the immediate area that day. We paid for a family ticket and I asked how long it would take to go around the place- an hour we were told! We walked round in less than half an hour. The monkeys had died, the leaf cutting",
          "We went with youngish children (ages 7-11) and they enjoyed the plants and animals. We paid \u00a31 extra (I think) for the bug show, and this was well worth it. Be aware - there's a cheaper admission deal for families (2 adults and 2 children) but make sure you ask for it - the",
          "fabulous day out for all the family. Make sure you bring some change to feed the Koi fish, and visit the monkeys",
          "Used to take the kids here when they where small and they lived it, but since then a lot has changed, not a lot to see, the rainforest hut was rubbish, lots of the things broken, gift shop looked like it was about to close which not much gifts to buy, went over the may holiday",
          "We visited with our 1 year old daughter and had a lovely time. She loved looking at all the trees and flowers and we had a wonderful time. It's not very big, and our first impressions weren't great, but once we got inside we loved it. Very reasonably priced and a great rainy day",
          "A rainy day on a Monday bank holiday in May, and as a family we were looking for something to do indoor with our small children. We thought Plantasia in Swansea might be a fun day out. However, this was not to be the case. Immediately from the outside you notice how run down",
          "Can't remember the cost but it wasn't too expensive. A few interesting animals and plants. Don't expect too much but it's pleasant enough.",
          "Have visited Plantasia several times over the last few years. The place is small but great for families. Children can roam around the attraction safely looking at the various plants, animals and artefacts. Inexpensive entry fee (around \u00a320 for a family of 7) and easily",
          "We only spent about an hour here and it is difficult to see how to spend any more time. Whole area very run down, entrance awful. While i understand what they are trying to do, perhaps some input from Tim Smit or other business person is needed? Sadly council run.",
          "So cheap and if anything should be renovated and expanded, student at swansea uni should be told. nice to pop into",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to Plantasia (Saturday 11th March). Quite busy with parents/grandparents giving their children a treat. Fascinating creatures on display and it was a challenge to spot some of them, especially the snakes hidden under rocks. I was intrigued by the",
          "Half term visit. Only \u00a313.45 for two adults and two children. Retail park in which it is situated is quite run down and shabby looking. Even the car park is lumpy and pot holed. Visited wth two teenagers. Our daughter is quite keen on gardening and exotic plants. Sadly the",
          "I don't agree with the negative reviews for this place. The price to get in is very reasonable (for 3 adults and 1 child it was less than \u00a315) and although it looks run down from the outside, on the inside the animals are well kept and we spent about an hour in there. Lots of",
          "Great plants .Great customer service .well looked after plants .would have given it 5 stars but for me the parrots cage should be bigger",
          "Took 20 minutes to walk around the whole place.. managed to drag time out a bit by letting the kids do some colouring in the little room there .. doesn't cost a lot to get in but for 20 minutes isn't worth it .. can hardly see the monkeys the way it's laid out and staff weren't",
          "My husband and I took two 5 year olds to Plantasia. We had never been and didn't know what to expect. We had a fun filled hour out. The staff were lovely, the facilities were spotless and the experience was great. The bush tucker trial session was great fun and the children",
          "It has come along way from its opening with tropical plants, suspended walkways. Butterflies used to hover amongst the plants. Now the building and all attached stores are either empty or in poor state of repair. Better to stay on the Mumbles road and head out to the Gower.",
          "a city center attraction suitable for people of all ages and well worth visiting for anyone in this area or travelling through. I am sure that children will enjoy it there",
          "Visited 16/10/16. As we live locally we were not expecting much from Plantasia. It is not a place that attracks a lot of attention. On arrival we were pleasently suprised to find that it was only \u00a33.00 each and our little one was free. There was plenty to keep us entertained for",
          "Went with partner and niece to have interactive experience with some of lifes more exotic creatures .... and loved it. From boa to giant iguana it was a real treat .... all the kids reactions were great ... just a shame that we found it difficult to hear the animal handler at",
          "Plantasia is a good attraction for the day, its deceivingly big and there's plenty to see. Ideal for a rainy day activity.",
          "This place is a little odd... It gets some good reviews but there wasn't really much to see or do here. We probably walked around it all with our little boy in about 30 minutes. We went on a rainy day and only really recommend if you're struggling for something to do... It's",
          "This is a lovely place to spend time with young children, There is a learnng area as you go in with paper crayons and info, then you can go and explore the creatures and plants and even feed the fish!There is a lovely cafe there too.",
          "As previous reviews have stated, Plantasia is very difficult to find and is situated in a retail park that has seen better days. We went into Swansea via the park and ride as we wanted to spend some time in the city centre as well as visiting Plantasia and didn't want to",
          "This large 'greenhouse' is badly situated as part of decrepit and mainly closed retail estate on the edge of Swansea city proper. The retail estate is slated for having a major revamp - but I think that this has been spoken about for a long time. Plantasia itself is",
          "Went here with my partner to enjoy the plants and learn about them but there wasn't all that information about the all the different plants they grew. It was also a bit random with tortoises, endangered monkeys and birds. Although it was alright and we're able to kill about an",
          "Free Parking was right outside on the retail park. Admission price was reasonable and Staff were welcoming. Highlights were the Rain Forest Hut, the Free Flying Bird enclosure and the quiz to do on the way round. Couldn't spend more than 2 hours there, and best for kids aged",
          "I went with my daughter and the two granddaughters, they are four and five. When we arrived the man on the counter started talking to the kids, asking them what animals and plants they like. Then we went in, first were tropical fish then insects and lizards, they liked them all",
          "This was the first time I have ever been and we loved it. Its absolutely beautiful and definitely worth a visit. We enjoyed seeing the gorgeous birds and my daughter loved feeding the fish. I would go again. It only took us an hour to get all the way around so it's nice and",
          "I had a rare day off so thought to take my little niece there for a treat yes you don't pay much but when your walking round it's not good and I would suggest they spend some money on it to get the business into Swansea and get people wanting to go there with their family and",
          "We popped into Plantasia on a rainy Monday. It certainly lifted our spirits. The plants are lovely, there's lots of information boards to read and loads of reptiles, birds and even monkeys to see. Above all, it was excellent value for money.",
          "It may only be a relatively small price to pay but this is shocking. Unfortunately, limited resources makes it look tired and forgotten. Not the best.",
          "a really surprising find, was a great time looking at all the plants and getting immersed in a rainforest in the middle of Swansea. interesting to see snakes, monkeys and birds here too.",
          "Hardly any animals there anymore.Felt quite dirty.Some tanks/Cages were empty.Really needs some money spent on it.Would not waste my money taking our little one again.",
          "The only real downside was that there wasn't more of the Plantasia! Was a good place to take children, and could have been great for adults if it was bigger, but the idea is great. A fair amount of exotic animals to see for the price, and a really pretty walk through a",
          "We visited on Monday 1st August due to rain on our holiday to the south of Wales. This should be free or have more to do. The outside should have been enough to put us off as it needed painting and all the walkways were blocked off due to broken paving. We had to walk through an",
          "see the insect, aquatic and reptile exhibits, then feed the fish and check out the chattering birds. Do some colouring and find the cocoa plant etc.",
          "What a hidden gem. Although I have visited several times I always enjoy. The young Australian man on the desk was fantastic. Great customer service, engaging with my 10 year old directly about activities on the day and coming up and asking if we enjoyed as we left. As a result",
          "My first visit since its been open, it seemed a bit run down but my grandaughter seemed to enjoy so would go again. Not bad value for money.",
          "Although my husband and I enjoyed our visit to Plantasia we were disappointed with how small the attraction was. Although we took our time to look at all the exhibits and read about them we were finished within an hour",
          "Love visiting Plantasia with my granddaughter. She never gets bored there. So much to do and fab it is on our doorstep.",
          "I visited Plantasia for the second time today with my sister and our 3 children aged 7, 3 and 8months. We used the coffee shop before we went in and the food and drink were great value. It was around \u00a313 for us to all get in, which I feel is excellent value and we also",
          "This is my second visit I like to see the Koi carp. We spent a couple of hours here. \u00a33.95 each adult. I think it looks dated since my last visit a few years ago. Needs a lick of paint and some pruning doing. When you walk from the car park it looks closed down. Worth a visit",
          "we took our 8 year old grandaughter here today, and it was worth every penny, such a lovely place ,you felt you were in a rain forest, would highly recommend for anyone.",
          "Took my son here with his dad for a family day out, he's a year old and enjoyed watching the fish and creepy crawlers, was laughing at the monkeys and had a lot of fun scribbling and colouring. Great value for money!",
          "We haven't been here for many years, since our children were small, and now we are taking our grandson. The structure looks a bit tired, but how on earth you maintain a building that's been overtaken by luscious tropical vegetation I don't know. There is certainly plenty there",
          "I loved the place and so did the kids. Plants, butterflies and a simply great visit so close to the city centre. If anyone is in the area it's a must to visit. Plenty of information for both adults and children.",
          "Plantasia is a quite amazing place and extremely interesting to visit. There is a very extensive range or plants and trees, both exotic, tropical and general. There are butterflies, animals and a large Koi Carp pond in the middle. It really is a must to visit if you are in",
          "Decided to take my niece and nephew for a day out, was raining so decided to come here. Was there for over an hour the kids loved it, especially the reptiles and birds. Reasonable prices. Highly recommend",
          "The weather was predicted rain, rain , rain. So decided on a visit to Plantasia, the attraction turned out to be an excellent way to spend an hour or so. Entrance fee very reasonable. It is ideal for younger children.",
          "I just visited plantasia as something to do on a rainy afternoon & it was a nice hour or so wondering around looking at the plants. There isn't a great deal there but it's a relaxing environment and inexpensive.",
          "had noticed this place online when looking for somewhere to take my 2 sons (6 and 4) for the afternoon. there is plenty of parking and the place is easy to find. staff were very polite and friendly and the cost to go in was great. walking round my boys loved to see the",
          "Went along as the weather was awful, but pleasantly surprised by this attraction. Enjoyed looking at the plants. The monkeys were very cute, and enjoyed the exotic birds as well. Price was very reasonable.",
          "This place is very well worth a visit if you are in Swansea. It only costs \u00a34 to get into and there is plenty to do for 2-3 hours at a leisurely pace. Its predominantly plants from all around the world, however, there are quite a few other fish, birds, snakes and monkeys. The",
          "Wasn't that bad but the location has to be one of the most depressing urban spots in Wales. The caged animals didn't appear as depressed as some reviewers have made out and though some looked as if they could do with a bigger enclosure. The few staff that we saw seemed friendly",
          "At half term they have animal shows such as owls spiders snakes that you can handle and a guide there to explain not much else there if no show on , the koi carp fish are lovely and when you go in the children get a sheet of questions to find things around the area nice place",
          "The price of entry is reasonable, however I was a little disappointed with this attraction, could definitely do with sprucing up.",
          "Only need a short visit, very scruffy and looking a little sad, but not expensive. Lots of tropical plants to walk through and a few displays of snakes, turtles, frogs etc, in equally sad conditions. In two minds whether to recommend or not, as I say if you have to kill half",
          "Not the largest or smartest attraction of its type, but for price of admission very good value. Around an hour and a half, long enough to spend here. Found staff friendly, a small shop area and cafe.You will see birds, fish, monkeys, spiders, snakes, cockroaches etc.",
          "I've been to Plantasia a few times. I love the different plants and even some of the animals there. Although I do get creeped out by the spiders. This is a lovely place to fill time or take the kids and get a day out of it.",
          "Amazing place to visit. The variety of tropical plants is amazing . You can also met Rainbow, the parrot .You can walk into a room where the birds fly free.They are noisy , but friendly!!",
          "I find it unbelievable how unenthusiastic the staff are. Every time I have been there, literally without fail, the staff are siting in the cafe and reluctantly stand up to serve you. No wonder the place is in danger of closing. Hate to think are taxes are going to these lazy",
          "Believe this is still going, great place for families and unique really as an attraction , great hot house and animals ,",
          "My partner and I went for a visit, spent around 30 minutes there. Animals in pretty small cages, especially the snakes - they didn't seem to be very happy or well cared for. Nice place on the whole but desperately needs some love and a bit of a facelift.",
          "Visited with four grandchildren ages ranging from 5 to 14. They all found something that was of interest. From the snakes to the Incas. The carp in the ponds and the unusual plants. It was not very expensive. It is not an all day trip a couple of hours at most",
          "A run down \"attraction\" in a run down area with depressed and run down animals. The plants main source of water is that which leaks from the \"tropical climate\" greenhouse. The pets at home would be a better visit for healthy cared for animals, and for plants maybe try B&Q",
          "Me and my partner visited for something to keep us busy for a few hours, took us half an hour maximum to walk around. The state the animals where kept in was appalling, they looked depressed, not to mention they where clearly not warm enough. Water was leaking in from the roof.",
          "I'm guessing footfall and therefore paying customers is falling as this part of town seems to have become less attractive. The animals are still interesting, but I agree with other reviews that it's a bit shabby and wouldn't warrant a quick return. Interesting once but not a",
          "Visited Plantasia on overcast November morning. Very friendly lady, good to spend an hour wandering round. Retail park could do with investment and face lift.",
          "Been here quite a few times through the years. Love feeding the koi, but finding it's a bit run down and old now. Needs some new and exciting things in here.",
          "This is a hidden gem in Wales its like a mini Eden lots of amazing tropical plants ,tropical birds,reptiles and even small monkeys and a beautiful waterfall Worth a visit",
          "My mum and Nan loved it here! I loved the idea of it, just wished there was more! If it was moved to a better location with more animals and plants/areas to explore this could be a fantastic attraction! But - nevertheless, we loved it! An experience like this shouldnt be missed!",
          "There are some good plants, a waterfall and animals. The animals included fish, small monkeys and parrots. It was good but is probably better with children. If you're after looking at plants, Swansea Botanical Garden is better and free.",
          "Nice little oasis in the heart of swansea. It's a little unloved and could do with some spit and polish. They have beautiful carp and tropical birds flying around. Large snakes and reptiles and tiny tamerind monkeys adorable. Very nice just to sit and relax.",
          "This place used to be a wonderous gem to explore, with caring, nurturing staff who were happy to engage and educate. Upon a recent visit, I found it to be dirty, very poorly run, and the staff had terrible attitutes and very poor customer service skills. It was like it was a",
          "Nestled in the centre of a shopping complex lies the plantasia swansea. An odd looking glass triangular shaped building it sits unassumingly and somewhat ignored by the distraction of the shopping outlets that surround it. Inside however you are welcomed into an oasis jungle",
          "Shamed to say I've never been before although lived in swansea for many years. It was ok. Not a great deal to do but did see the fish. Would I go back??? Probably if guests wanted to go yes I would",
          "This was not usually where I would go but we fancied a change and here we went. An indoors amazon with the opportunity to see a variety of plants and animals. Its just situated just off a retail park which is bizarre but its nice to pop in to and have a mooch around even though",
          "We always come here especially when it's a rainy day.We always enjoy walking round and we never get bored lovely plants and the monkey's are quite funny too.",
          "After visiting lots of attractions over the last 20 years. The staff at plantasia are the rudest I've ever come across due to this I am never visiting or recommending this establishment to anyone.",
          "Paradise in a built up area. If you are visiting Swansea and want something different why not visit here. Plantasia is a tropical garden under one roof from tiny plants to great big trees. It will only take an hour to see it all but a great divergence from the norm.",
          "We visited here as we were staying around swansea and it rained. We absolutely loved this place. It was well priced it only cost about \u00a310 for me, my husband and our daughter to get in. Once inside we got to see a variety of fish and reptiles in the wildlife area. The",
          "Went here years ago and it was beautiful...visited today with great expectations but was left dissapointed, animals poorly kept, wilting plants, 1 miserable looking monkey and a giant snake kept in an area that was disgustingly tiny..the poor creature was 3 times the length of",
          "Promised a tropical adventure, with monkeys, reptiles, tropical birds and rain forest. What we got was a large greenhouse that felt cooler than the damp summer's day outdoors, half a dozen parrots, two small monkeys, 2 very small tree frogs, a macaw, a tank of dried out coral",
          "This is a great place to visit, I came here last year with a friend as I had never been before. It has a lot to offer especially for families with children, and it is very cheap to look around too!",
          "Wet day on holiday in Wales so looked up places to visit in Swansea. This sounded good and not too expensive for family of 5. It was great. A lot squeezed into a small space and free parking! On the minus side their card machine was broken & we weren't told about the fish food",
          "We visited this attraction and thought it was quaintly nice. When you get there you may think it's a derelict shopping centre but it is open and a bit further on therw is an odeon cinema and tenpin bowling centre. It will take you about a leisurely hour to get round. Lovely",
          "We visited Plantasia on a rainy morning. The location looks very tired, a retail park which is in definite need of investment. The entrance the Plantasia is not appealing, staff were friendly enough however. Once inside the animals and plants are both interesting and enjoyable",
          "The moment I walked into the place, I felt like the staff were just waiting for it to shut down. I don't know why, it is run by the council, but it has the feel of a place that's not going to be around for long.... regulars were hogging the staff as they discussed local things,",
          "Major upgrade needed. Great educational place to visit but very uninspiring to look at. Cafe (food poor) and gift shop (what remains) do not look as advertised.... The Parc Tawe centre is also very under occupied and in need of TLC! A bit dissapointing when the plantain has so",
          "A place mainly to educate children about different parts of the world. A place that our grandchildren still like to visit. We saw a display by a bird handler which they found enjoyable.There is a small cafe and a small souvenir shop.Not many toilets.",
          "Alot of the plants are dying or dead, the animals are in a depressing state. Theres a newt without a tail, a bearded dragon missing part of his, turtles with an inadequate lamp in a tank that is way too small, dirty fish tanks (with fish missing that are on the information",
          "Had another lovely visit here this weekend with my granddaughter. Educational and fun. I do hope the rumours of closure are just that and not true as it would be such a shame for this place to close.",
          "Looks quite small form outside but packed full of interest. The first section houses aquariums, insects, reptiles etc, all well labelled with an education room which is also used by schools. In the main glasshouse the mature plants have almost become a part of the structure",
          "Been here a few times never disappointed great place. I hope the plans for demolition are changed. And they fit it in with other plans.",
          "A wonderful space in the city, then hothouse is full of interestng plants, the waterfall is very tranquil, a great collection of birds, fish, reptiles, insects. Make sure you catch a hands on show if you can, it was great fun, educational and the keeper was excellent. Holding",
          "Plantasia is undoubtedly one of the finest things our city have ever achieved, Its UNTHINKABLE for it to ever close. The educational value alone as an asset to our schools etc it without compare. Despite some areas showing a lack of badly needed investment it is STILL a",

          "Visited Plantasia with my partner and our 2 year old daughter. From walking through the front doors it appeared that the potential forthcoming closure had already begun. The shelves of the so-called 'gift shop' were very poorly stocked, and the cafe looked rather unwelcoming. We",
          "We visited here earlier in the week. Arrived early and booked in for the bird talk. The guy giving the talk and showing his birds was brilliant. Very knowledgable and able to tailor it to be very child friendly. We love visiting Plantasia and do so on a regular basis, I do hope",
          "There are very few all-weather attractions in Swansea, especially if you want to give your child some exposure to a bit of culture. Plantasia is very affordable, the kids learn stuff, and it's helping conserve endangered species. Today we paid a bit extra for a live Birds of",

          "A wonderful place to visit for an hour or two. The bird enclosure that you can walk through is lovely and the monkeys are facinating. A great place to experience a more tropical climate and find out more about plants that grow there and animals who survive there. It's a little",
          "Good place to spend an hour or so in Swansea. Suitable for individuals looking to explore and learn more about the plants and animals living in the tropics. There is not much variety of animals but Plantasia provides an atmosphere of serenity for anyone looking for a quick",
          "I discovered plantation through a friend. You can see the the council is not funding it as it should, but the staff are trying hard to make it work. The plants are lovely, and the animals that are now left can do with a visit from a friendly family. I found the staff extremely",
          "I visited the Sunday before Christmas when Toys r Us (the building next door) was full and Plantasia was deserted. The animals are a bit so so but the plants are spectacular. Not a huge place but there's a tardis vibe in the Amazon zone. A pleasant way to while away up to an",
          "So much could be done on this . Needs a complete revamp including the staff. The animals/ Insects are well worth a look but don't expect to be there for hours, because you can get around it in 1hour, so a day out it is not. Plus get there early to feed the fish once food has run",
          "My son loves animals so I thought a visits to here should waste a couple of hours. It's ok. I thought it was quite boring. Needs a clean and there is never enough food for the fish. No colouring sheets. No staff to ask. my son had more fun in the nearby toys r us store. Says it",
          "I know there are some negative reviews of this but I really feel it's unfair. I love Plantasia - there are plenty of smaller reptiles, butterflies, birds and a huge range of trees. My children loved the Rainforest hut and the carnivorous plants. As an environmentalist I really",
          "We visited Plantasia yesterday with our three children and was left really disappointed. There were hardly any animals and the plants did not look as if they were cared for at all. The \"lemon\" tree had no lemons and the \"banana\" tree was also bare! The leaves on other plants",
          "We bought a season ticket for my daughter and her family after visiting the website, which made it look fantastic. Just what we were looking for, for her and the children to enjoy. We all went there yesterday to enjoy what as on offer and treat the children to lunch whilst we",
          "the outside looks run down ,not worth the money family of 5 and we were there no longer than 30mins waste of money:(",
          "We visited here and personally I thought we'd come to the wrong place. The site looked as though it had shut down with the surrounding area also looking in need of some urgent regeneration. When we walked in we payed the woman on the till who kindly told us our best and cheapest",
          "quite nice place actually in Swansea where you can take your family to enjoy the plants from all over the world... if you like animals and plants this place is for you!!!!!!!!!",
          "Must admit we have lived in Northern Australia so are used to seeing some of these creatures on our back yard. Nevertheless I feel this is a tired display with inattentive staff and well overpriced. Only awesome for under 5s I would say.",
          "I hadnt visited Plantasia in many a year when I returned this past weekend with my wife and young child. It cant be blamed for its location, but Parc Tawe as a whole is looking mighty rundown, with some serious regeneration needed. Plantasia itself has suffered the same fate,",
          "I visit Plantasia regularly with the children. They love looking at the creepy crawlies and snakes and are fascinated with the plants and monkeys. Fantastic place to visit on a rainy day. Staff are helpful and friendly and the cafe is lovely to sit down with a coffee. Great",
          "This was a second visit and I was disappointed that the butterfly house was not there now, but it was still an enjoyable visit. There are plants there from desert region and tropical plants plus lots of creepy crawlies and monkeys to keep the kids happy. There is a waterfall and",
          "Some friends and I visited Plantasia over the Bank Holiday weekend whilst staying in Swansea and can't understand why this doesn't appear on the \"63 things to see and do in Swansea\" list that my friend pulled off the internet. We were very impressed with everything on display",
          "It was \u00a33 each and we spent most of the afternoon here. I've been going here since I was little and I've always enjoyed. They have a variety of interesting animals and plants and it's well worth buying a bag of fish food to feed the koi carp. It would be interesting if they had",
          "I absolutley love Plantasia! Cheap to get in for adults and children. Even if you have a family pass it is still cheap. I actually wanted to have my birthday there but unfortunatley im too old hah! Love the place. And there are food courts around the place!",
          "My wife & myself took our grandson there one cold rainy day. The little one enjoyed feeding the fish & looking at the reptiles at the main entrance. The rest of the place doesn't have that much to offer unless you are really interested in plants. They had a few few birds &",
          "We visited on a cold sunday afternoon. Visited with a baby 7months and a two year old. First noteable thing is the staff were very helpful held doors open for us to get the buggy and pram in. Paid for my husband and myself but as the children were under three they were free.",
          "Lovely place,very peaceful and beautiful but prices are expensive for what you get for adults. Not worth the money at all in my opinion.x",
          "We went to Plantasia today for the first time since it opened, and we are glad we waited so long! It is beautiful inside, (the entrance is in the building that houses U,C,I, Cinemas). We paid \u00a33..20 each with concessions, which is very cheap. Plenty for children, with",
          "I would highly recommend plantasia for a visit- it was pretty and really enjoyable to stroll around. It had some great bugs and animals to have a look at and my daughter, who was 18 months at the time loved it! It has a holiday feel to it and I was pleasantly surprised how good",
          "I used to bring children to visit the Plantasia when they were younger and we visited it again on our recent trip to Swansea. It was still very interesting for the children to visit and they enjoyed seeing all the different plants, birds, fish and reptiles. Good value for a",
          "Though the staff are nice and polite at Plantasia, the animals are somewhat less excited to see you from behind the glass box. If you've got kids with you, up to the age of 12, and you're looking for 1-2 hours activity, then this might be your thing. They will enjoy the first",
          "We went here because I was told it was worth a visit. We got there and paid, I can't remember exactly how much we paid but I remember saying that it was expensive for what it was. Some of the tropical plants are interesting and it does make for some pretty impressive",
          "We first visited when our daughter was 2 years old. It worked out that by paying just a little more for 2 adults (under 3s were free) we could have an annual pass. During the past year, we've visited several times when passing through Parc Tawe or having a free morning. There",
          "No deer park, no pigs,sheep or alpaca, no outdoor kids park, no maze world, no treetop walk, no picnic area, no outdoor woodlands. It's just a small indoor hothouse with some animals, 1 parrot, a small pond overstocked with large koi carp, a few cute cotton top tamarind monkeys,",
          "Looking for something to do on (another) wet day in April while my parents were visiting, we decided to try Plantasia. It was warm and (relatively) dry, there was some mist spray for some plants in places. My parents are keen gardeners and said they thoroughly enjoyed it here.",
          "We wanted something to interest everyone from a 20 month old to a 93 year old and found it here. Friendly staff. Lots of fun with animal, insects, birds and plants. There was even an offer of free toast with your hot drink at the cafe.",
          "Located in the centre of Swansea, Plantasia is a reasonably small tropical garden and small zoo. Reptiles such as snakes, terrapins, and bearded dragons greet you as you walk in, alongside an array of tropical fish. Further along, the glasshouse is occupied by thousands of",
          "Plantasia it's self is reasonably small, and as the name might suggest, full of plants. There are some animals to see - on entry there are some fish, bugs and terrapins, walking round there are some tortoises and some tamarin monkeys. I was asked on entry whether we wanted to",
          "My daughter wanted to go here on the way to Aberystwyth so that she could photograph the snakes! ER...... perhaps that should be snake! Yes, there are a few creatures but this is a prime example of a real non attraction. Mainly plants - a few wooden parrots to make up for the",
          "Very worthwhile if it's a rainy or cold day. The centre-piece of this glass is a tropical jungle with birds, monkeys, fish and cacti in separate areas. It's not huge but not expensive either. You'll probably spend 30mins in there. Kids enjoyed it.",
          "You won\u2019t think there is a botanic, tropical indoor garden in somewhere rainy and coastal like Swansea which surprises you when you discover the lovely Plantasia. And there is more inside then you would think. Along with a tropical walk through the jungle plants to a pool in the",

          "Lots of good things to say about this place. If I had children it would be an ideal place to take them for a fun educational and at times hands on experience",
          "Great educational experience for the whole family, especially great for families with young children has great facilities.",
          "Plantasia is a lovely place to distract yourself and the kids for a few hours. A friendly mixture of tropical plants, animals and activities. Look out for extra activities on their website like meeting birds of prey or reptiles... great fun.",
          "Lots to see and do and a paradise for children. A fascinating and diverse range of animals and plants and welcoming and friendly staff.",
          "My husband and I took our 11month old baby here for something to do while it rained, the entrance fee was very reasonable and you got to learn of the tropical rain forests, cotton top monkeys. We were also able to put 20p in a food dispenser for a generous portion of fish",
          "If your in Swansea, it's well worth the very cheap entry fee to take a look round Plantasia. There are a some fantastic cacti and tropical fauna. The only problem is...it's a little small.",
          "Animals as well as plant life a good place to organize a school trip to or just as a day out for a couple",
          "This slightly scruffy place was a wonderful change from the unrelenting rain on the Gower. It was cheap to get in.....under 4quid and kept us occupied with a 2year old and a 3 year old for several hours. Snakes and Tamarins and tropical fish. It's like a mini Eden project.",
          "looked at the Plantasia website before deciding to go, was expecting a lot more than what we got. the place had a general feeling of tiredness. The plants did not look healthy and not very well cared for and there was a sense that the place was not loved. The animal/fish section",
          "I have visited this place a couple of times but not really my cup of tea. It was too expensive in my opinion. I was disappointed with the animals they had inside. Some monkeys and birds and that's about it. They have a gift shop too but again it's very dear. I guess it would be",
          "My children aged 5 and 10 persuaded me to take them here. Admission fees are cheap \u00a39.85 for one adult and 2 kids. The plants looked old and needed a good clear out. The sign said 'monkey feeding 1pm, we were at the monkeys for the feeding experience but no-one arrived, when",
          "We passed a couple of hours on a rainy day. The kids particularly enjoyed the animal experience and the man running it was an experienced hand and excellent with the kids. Good value for money but on the small side.",
          "This is one place to visit when you need to be in doors, it's so full of many plants flowers and birds ect",
          "I wasn't impressed with the conservatory. The plants needed cleaning up as there were dead leaves and it looked like the plants needed more sunlight. Seemed a bit damp and musty. I found some of the animal and insect aquariums to be sub-standard and rather dark and dank.",
          "Great day out for all the family but do be aware its very very stuffy inside due to the exotic plants, cafe and shop here",
          "A small but lovely attraction in the warm and dry! Lovely plants and cute monkeys.",
          "Plenty of animals to see and great for the 6-11 age group.",

          "I live locally and really enjoy visiting. It needs a little bit more investment. Basically it is a mini-Eden-project glass-house with rainforest type plants with some animals/birds. There is an indoor 'exploration' room/area which I think is really educational and informative",

          "Fab family day out here and its quite reasonable!! Children adore this place!",
          "Pantasia isn't big by any means, but what it provides is good. During half term the centre often has live animal antics entertainment, when a trainer may bring along reptiles, birds of prey etc and give the children a very informative educational lesson whilst allowing the",
          "I went here a few months ago, and i had a pleasent day out, i recommend going when a talk is on, we went to one where a guy came in to talk about the Amazon and it appealed to adults and children a like. It was imformative and a good day out but personally as we wnet with no",
          "Its OK to spend a couple of hours there if it is raining.",
          "Love Plantasia - I've been here about five times now. Took my 8 month old son along, he absolutely loved looking at the Coi carp, the monkeys and all the leaves on the tropical plants. Really baby-friendly venue with changing facilities and a good cafe for light",
          "We went during Octover half term and were ask to pay \u00a31 extra per person for the interactive event, we hesitated at first and so glad we went: it was brilliant. This particular event was to introduce children to all different animals and creepy crawlies : cockroaches,",
          "Returned here for the first time in 15 years recently and not much has changed in this mini Eden Project. The Parc Tawe (where the place is situated) is looking a little worse for wear, with many shops shut, but Plantasia still looks the same as it always did. Admission was",
          "Visited with a friend who had never been. Fantastic coy carp in the pond, we loved watching them. Although it looks large from the outside it is fuul of trees and plants, so you have to account for them.",
          "before you go into the actual \"hot house\" part there was a few lizards and snakes ect. in tanks but on the floor there was a couple of dead cokroaches dotted about and a few live ones, but when you get into the hot house the path is flooded with dead and live cockroaches which",
          "Very expensive and the children were ready to leave after an hour.wouldn't recommend!",
          "This was a food afternoon visit. Needed somewhere to visit due to the rain. Our son really enjoyed feeding the fish and we found it quite within budget, especially with the 2 for 1 voucher from vouchercloud. Would visit again but in a few years time.",
          "Nice place to visit for a change, enjoyed seeing the animals and the monkeys had quite a big enclosure. Not somewhere I would visit again in a massive hurry as once you've seen it once that's it sort if thing. Nice fish pond but was disappointed to hear that the butterfly house",
          "As well as plants there are a range of animals to see. The plants are in well crafted displays with a mature forest being the best. There is a treetop trail which is good. The downside is this is a small attraction and not much to kepp you entertained for a half-day."

        "wiki": "Swansea (; Welsh: Abertawe [ab\u025br\u02c8taw\u025b]) is a coastal city and county, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe) in Wales. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of G\u0175yr on the southwest coast. The county area includes Swansea Bay (Welsh: Bae Abertawe) and the Gower Peninsula. Swansea is the second largest city in Wales and the twenty-fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. According to Swansea Council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014, the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. Together with Neath and Port Talbot, Swansea formed a wider Urban Area of 300,352 in 2011.\nDuring the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname Copperopolis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological finds in the Swansea area come mostly from the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans occupied the area.\nThe two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes through the city centre and the Loughor which marks the northern border with Carmarthenshire. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to Mouth of the Tawe. It first appears c.1150 as Aper Tyui.Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its English name may derive from Sveinn's island \u2013 Old Norse: Sveinsey \u2013 the reference to an island may refer either to a bank at the mouth of the River Tawe or to an area of raised ground in marshes. An alternative explanation derives the place name from the Norse personal name Sweyn and ey, which can mean \"inlet\". This explanation supports the tradition that the city was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (reigned in Denmark from 986 to 1014). The name is pronounced Swans-y /\u02c8sw\u0252nzi/), not Swan-sea.The earliest known form of the modern name, Sweynesse, appears in the first charter, granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as Sweyneshe. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.Following the Norman conquest, a marcher lordship was granted by Henry I under the title of Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nFrom the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.\nThe port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed \"Copperopolis\". From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%\u2014the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales\u2014in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from \u00a3112 in 1860 to \u00a335 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.\nThe Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThrough the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.\n\nIn the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz').\nIn 1969 Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.\nIt backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe \"City and County of Swansea\" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.\nThe local government area is 378 square kilometres (146 sq mi) in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering 4,562 acres (1,846 ha) in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status, and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe).Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.\n\n\n=== Welsh Parliament ===\nThe Welsh Parliament constituencies are:\n\nGower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016\nSwansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011\nSwansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011The city is also part of the South Wales West regional constituency and is served by Suzy Davies MS (Conservative), Bethan Jenkins MS (Plaid Cymru), Caroline Jones MS (UKIP) and Dai Lloyd MS (Plaid Cymru).\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK parliamentary constituencies in Swansea are:\n\nGower, current MP is Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour since 2017\nSwansea East, current MP is, Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2015\nSwansea West, current MP is Geraint Davies, Labour since 2010\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSwansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula to the west was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.\nThe most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast\u2014the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.\nThe geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to 185 metres (607 ft) range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to 193 metres (633 ft) high. The highest point is located Penlle'r Castell at 374 metres (1,227 ft) on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate. As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic. In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrom 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. \nAround 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.The wider urban area, including most of Swansea Bay, has a total population of 300,352, making it the third largest urban area in Wales and the 27th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are Asian \u2013 mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.\nThe Office for National Statistics 2010 mid-year population estimate for the City & County of Swansea is 232,500.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nThe Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.\nFluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.\nIn 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at \u00a318 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSwansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.\n\n\n=== Welsh language ===\nThere are many Welsh language chapels and churches in the area.

Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the \"Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales\" and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is \"the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered\". The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts.

He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; his take on Swansea was that it was an \"ugly lovely town\". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Caf\u00e9 which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city. Their wealth and influence came from large copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea.

In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.\nIn 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Ospreys. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible.

In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.\nThe Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J.

Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city's Sainsbury's store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans \u2013 Castle Street development.

The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in public administration, education & health and banking, finance & insurance, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average.

          "A great place to visit to get a bit more education & general knowledge. Not huge but plenty to see. Friendly staff on hand to guide & help if necessary. Free entry now of course.",
          "A hidden gem of a museum frequently overlooked. There is a mouse trail for the kids to keep them entertained but a fascinating temp exhibition of years of swansea as a city and how music links in. let alone a mummy exhibition and plenty of details to keep everyone interested",
          "We called by on our way home from holiday, as 14 year old loves history. 2 youngest took part in the mouse trail, but all 3 loved the museum. Staff were friendly and helpful, exhibits were fab!",
          "This museum is quite small but has a few interesting exhibits. The highlight of the museum is the Egyptian mummy housed at the top of the stairs. Other exhibits include a plesiosaur, copper produced at the Hafod-Morfa works and a stuffed passenger pigeon. It is free which makes",
          "This was a return visit for us, and we were certainly not disappointed. The museum is housed in a beautiful building constructed in a neo-classical style in 1841 for the Royal Institution of South Wales. There is no fixed entry charge, but there are two separate boxes for",
          "I thought that what was here was good but I left feeling that I didn\u2019t really know much more about the area. Some nice things to look at.",
          "My two grandsons and l had a nice time at Swansea museum. There was lot to see for every age group. Plus lots of extra activities had been put on. Lots of things to keep the smallest of children amused To big area of broken house hold goods for older children to try and fix Even",
          "This exhibition is excellent and really is very informative.Around all the hype about the moon landing the flight across the Atlantic 100 years ago seems to have been forgotten.The exhibition details the flight in amazing detail and deserves a wider audience and I was surprised",
          "This is a small museum, so only a short visit to see everything. We enjoyed looking round the different rooms, which were a mixture of all sorts. There was a ceramics section, which we found interesting, although we would have liked some more details on some of the exhibits.",
          "Great place for any type of visit, there are always events on not only in the museum but in at the venue",

There\u2019s some really special pieces within the museums collection, such as the mummy, and we really enjoyed seeing that and some of the other interesting pieces held there. But then large",
          "The Museum provides many unexpected surprises. In two buildings, the Main one houses Art works, an Egyptology exhibition, World War One exhibition and an amazing collection of porcelain - Swansea,Nantgarw and other famous potters. User friendly- it has a childrens trail which",
          "We all enjoyed the World War exhibit. It was very moving and thought provoking. The children loved the section on 'old Swansea' and they particularly enjoyed the Egyptian mummy.",

          "my two grandchildren and very inquisitive found that the museum and fount the museum brought up so may things to ask about, If I was not certain there was someone who could help. There is a wide range of displays that allow the children to use their imagination",
          "Enjoyed looking round this one more than the Waterside museum, there were lots of different things to see and the children enjoyed searching for the mice and getting stickers. Both are free. It is easy to park in the Waterside car park and walk round to this one.",
          "Looking to waste a few hours in Swansea.and came across this little place. An older museum set near Swansea marina. Parking is close by. An interesting collection of various artefacts going back to Roman occupation of the Swansea area. Also a small E gyptian display with its own",

The usually quiet museum was bursting at the seams. Within a stone's throw was an event attracting thousands",

          "We enjoyed a good hour or two here looking at the exhibition on Swansea\u2019s ethnic make up as well as its roll in WW1. This was extremely well done. The Egyptology section is small but, again, well done. For those interested in ceramics there is also a large room full of locally",

          "Absolutely fantastic place, probably the best Great War exhibition we've seen in a while, it was very educational and both our 8 and 6 year olds absolutely loved it. We will definitely go back again when we are in the South Wales Swansea area.",
          "What a gem of a museum, not as promoted as a visitor attraction as it should be. Spent at least 2 hrs viewing the exhibitions which were really interesting and informative depicting Swansea during the war and also there construction of the trench brilliant. The Egyptology room",

          "I went to Swansea museum and its really good knowledge about all different things like Egyptian times - Victorian - world war and ect.... they also have a caf\u00e9 there and it is all tourism leaftes about visit Swansea bay and alots more and the staff are very helpful.",
          "Really enjoyed our trip to the Swansea museum. Was surprised how much there was to see. Old photos, war memorabilia, lots of china, even a couple of mummies. And all of this with no entry fee was amazing",
          "As we were in Wales visiting family, we decided to visit the museum, we only had limited time, so we didn't see everything. Possibly need 4 hrs to see it all. Very impressive.",
          "Lots of lovely little activities to do with the children plus lots for them to explore. Children loved the Egyptian Mummy and my eldest's topic in school is WW2 and this was perfect to stir the imagination for that! Love the new interactive Music room!",
          "Lovely old building housing displays of items of local historical interest, a room displaying beautiful Swansea pottery, and a very special place for the mummy that has lived in the museum for very many years.",
          "Small and fairly interesting museum. Free to go in, staff very enthusiastic and friendly. Not comparable with the great London museums but worth going just to be humbled by the skin of a Passenger Pigeon - once the world's most abundant bird but wiped out by over hunting and",
          "What an impressive display! They also have their very own Egyptian Mummy, but for me the room dedicated to The First World War is so impressive and well worth a visit. The trench is so realistic.",
          "It's free. Currently in process of being updated but still lots to see. Ceramics is wonderful. Helpful staff, they will advise about other things in Swansea as the City has [unbelievably] no tourist information office.",
          "The museum is really interesting, with special exhibitions, world war 1 exhibitions and local specialty. An amazing place",
          "Enjoyed the exhibit of The Great War. The British played a big role in the victory, so it was interesting to see it. Should have a tour guide to explain the details.",
          "I went we weekend of 27th august with my other half. Really nice museum. Super small but super interesting. A lot of details about the war. 100% recommended! It is a must see if you like history",
          "They say size does not necessarily matter, and this is certainly true of this not-so-big museum, because what a gem it is, full of local lore, including a Dylan Thomas connection. My favourites are the stunning pottery room and the social history dioramas. Less so the featured",
          "First time I have visited for a number of years - although I used to come here often as a child. I was pleased to see Hor the mummy still on display. I was disappointed though that the Welsh kitchen has gone which was always my favourite exhibit as a child. Currently there is a",
          "The museum is housed in a very attractive building. We were a bit short on time so unfortunately only visited the exhibition about the First World War. We found it to be very interesting and it had a particular local aspect. We will certainly visit next time we are in Swansea",
          "You won't realise until you visit here how much history there is in Swansea. Well worth a wander around on a weekend. There's plenty for children to do as well, and the staff are friendly and well informed. Would recommend",
          "This is quite a small museum, it deals with the history of the Swansea area, from prehistory through to the end of the last century, there is also a room with egyptian artifacts including a mummy. The paintings are exhibited on the stairwell (watch your step!). There are many",

          "We had booked a talk by a lady who takes on the role of a servant during Victorian times and dresses in the costume of the day. She was speaking of her time as a lowly servant, starting off in a big house as the lowest rank servant as a very young child and moving on to other",
          "I've been visiting this museum for pretty much as long as I can remember. One of my childhood favourites was a case of stuffed Victorian birds (a fair few I think were shot by some of my ancestors. Sorry about that). My favourite was a Passenger Pigeon, and I was glad to see on",
          "Great free museum with children's activities taking place when we went Saturday end of Feb Half term. My sons were interested in the WW1 trench and war film and also the mummy! Drinks machine and gift shop. In an interesting old looking building not far from car park and",

          "Small museum but very interesting, from the steam engine and Cornish beam outside, to the smallest exhibit inside. Very thoughtfully laid out - I like to take my time and look at and read everything so I'll just have to come back and see more. WW1 and other exhibitions tell",
          "Good temporary expo on WWI from the Swansea point of view. Otherwise the artifacts on history and life in Swansea are a bit sketchy and not all that well presented. A little sad.",
          "A visit to this fine museum turned a damp day into something much more memorable. It is very interesting afternoon out, with a very good section devoted to how the horrors of the First World War affected this busy Welsh city. The disturbing, and poignant personnel biographies",
          "We often visit Swansea Museum, described by Dylan Thomas as \u201cthe museum which looks as though it should be in a museum\u201d. To commemorate the outbreak of World War One in 1914, the museum created an excellent display with details of local soldiers and a reconstructed trench. The",
          "What a gem. The main room covered Swansea from Paleolithic to modern times with more emphasis on the earlier periods (up to Roman Swansea) than modern period. Don't miss out on the Egyptian Room - it is a little Tardis. At the time, the downstairs rooms had an exhibition on",
          "Popped into Swansea Museum as staying nearby. A great little find packed with a range of artefcats and displays. A must see is the Egyptian mummy and alos the WWI trench. Free entry and within easy walk of the main shopping area.",

          "One of the best things in this museum is the mouse trail. I always look forward to doing it every time I visit. There's also an excellent WWI exhibition on at the moment. The reconstructions were really fascinating, and it's great that you can go in them, and interact with",

          "What's up tripadvisors. Unlike some of my other reviews I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. Excellent museum and in my eyes a much much better museum than the waterfront museum behind (even though it has a fraction of the size and budget). You could get lost for hours",
          "An impressive display of the Great War and a good insight as to how it affected families in Wales. Lots of other interesting displays in different rooms and floors.",
          "Great War was well documented. It relates to citizens of the area. Other exhibits were of interest. Much local history. Just not my cup of tea, sorry. Looks like this musuem could use a major donor to get things moving. Admission is free.",
          "worth a visit, especially if you're interested in local history. An excellent display room of Swansea China, which is remarkably varied, and often a well curated 'special' exhibition about relevant local history. The museum is struggling for funds (from the Local Authority)",
          "Visited on a rainy day with my friend on holiday over from Brisbane. Very interesting and loved seeing the Egyptian mummy. This was the highlight for me. One gallery was being refurbished so it took us roughly an hour to go around and I am on crutches. Considering the age of",

          "Very interesting exhibition on the Great War's impact on Swansea. Was pleased to see it didn't just cover the brave men who laid down their lives for us but also featured conscientious objectors and the important role played by women. The Egyptian Mummy and the X-Ray of it were",
          "the great war exhibits was well curated and displays were good. enjoyed the video which gave a snapshot of events. particularly liked the 'trench reconstruction' the women in jazz exhibition was also interesting, some of the fashion items could have been shown to better",
          "A lovely gem of interest during an interesting stay in Swansea when I didn't know much about the area. Enjoyed learning about the Jazz influence, the World War II exhibition was very well presented , and it is worth going upstairs to see the Egyptian Mummy.",
          "This museum has a number of exhibits on local archaeological finds and tells the story of X swansea from the ice age to modern times. There is a large pterosaurs section. The exhibits that stood out for me were the world war 1 room which focuses on the experiences of local",
          "If you remember that this is a relatively small museum and set your expectations accordingly then it's well worth on hour. The small Egyptian gallery has it's very own mummy and coffin and whilst the size of a family bathroom is good for 10 minutes or so. The archeology gallery",
          "After meeting up with friends for lunch, we decided to have a stroll around Swansea. We popped in here for 5 mins but ended up staying awhile longer. Nice little museum well worth a visit.",

          "Really liked the museum. The Great War gallery was really interesting. I found lots of information about the War, which I didn't know before. Seeing the Mumia was a good thing, but a bit terrific. Enjoyed the visit, highly recommend",
          "This is the oldest museum in Wales. The collections contain objects from Swansea's past and the rest of the world. You visit Swansea Museum at four locations: Oystermouth Road; the Tramshed in Dylan Thomas Square in the Marina; the Museum Stores in Landore; and the floating",
          "We spent a good part of an afternoon here on a wet Swansea wednesday.Best part was the World War 1 exhibition portrayed through the stories of local soldiers and their families-very evocative and moving.There is quite a large pottery and porcelain exhibition as well as a small",
          "I really enjoyed the special World War I exhibition, which took up the entire large room to the right. Many soldiers from Wales had fought in the Battle of the Somme, which was roughly 100 years ago, thus this exhibition. Unique equipment, diaries, an interesting video, a",
          "A group of 13 went to see the Egyptian gallery housing the mummy of Hor. This is a lovely little gallery with Hor at the centre and various objects displayed around the room. Whilst the displays were nice labelling was a little confusing. The temporary exhibition on WW1 was",

          "Considering the history and facilities within the Swansea area there is a very sparse array to refer to any times past in history.",
          "Ever since I was younger, I have always enjoyed visiting this museum and I still do. It has free entry and lots of things of interest, including a real Egyptian mummy, which 9 year old me was infatuated with! Lots of stuff for younger children and teens too, nice learning",
          "Dylan Thomas loved this museum. He said it was \"the kind of museum that should be in a museum\" and he is right! It is very quaint and has lots of things that are fun to look like an Egyptian mummy and exhibits if they get funding for them.",
          "As a museum it pretty much lives up to it's name. But I felt that the inside of the building could do with a bit of TLC. It seems the inside of the building has been neglected a little and could benefit with a bit of updating. They had a nice exhibition on calligraphy and I",
          "Not much going on here, paintings, some various arty things, Egyptian exhibits and some world war things, other than that very little. You may find it more interesting than me though so I suggest you see for yourself. The bayonets and grenades were of great interest to my 12",

          "I arrived at this museum at 5 o'clock, the official closing time, but fortunately it was open an extra couple of hours for a purple event. It had a ww1 exhibition including a mockup trench and real letters which was excellent for getting a real feeling of what it must have been",

          "They do special themes like Scott of the Antarctic. As it is in the Marina area of Swansea it is easily accessible. I have visited since a child and never tire of visiting.",
          "A lovely building holding many wonderful relics of past years. Shame it wasn't a little bigger but hosts some great exhibitions even with the limited space. The titanic one back a while was great and so was the WW1.",

          "I adore this museum. It reminds me of a slightly eccentric aunt - never quite know what your going to get. The Dylan Thomas exhibition is a must; being transported back in time to an authentic pub is worth making the trip alone. The staff are friendly, knowledgable and",

          "We visited today as my father in law, who is a keen metal detector and has donated a roman brooch that he found to the museum so we went to see it in situ. We were very impressed by the collections, especially the Egyptian mummy. Well worth a visit, we will be going back as we",

This local museum was quaint, maybe even a bit shabby, but it was full of interesting finds from the local area from Neolithic through Roman occupation, industrialization and up to the modern day.

          "Great morning out, there's a mouse hunt for the kids too.",
          "Vey nie place to hang out",
          "Great music exhibition",
          "Excellent Museum, with interesting exhibits for all ages.",
          "Very old fashioned. About 60 years out of date. They have the exhibits,  but old style displays make it a boring fusty place where i would only go if it was raining.  Needs massive makeover. Otherwise: nice",
          "Visited many many times as a child and this seemed so look much smaller than I remembered ...but of course I am bigger now \u263a.  They have moved the mummy Hor into a darker,  more protected room and have covered his nasty exposed toes \ud83d\ude06.  They have a really interesting video showing the restoration of the mummy as well.",
          "Helpful staff and a great few hours out",
          "Friendly staff, beautiful history and pieces inside the museum, with a small shop at the front. As expected, absolutely free, with a mummy upstairs, very cool!",
          "Great place for families.",
          "One of my favourite all time places to come and see some history of Swansea, but also getting to see a real life mummy is incredible, children love it here. Good little gift shop, worth going to the waterfront museum too when you are here!!",
          "Very interesting, wide variety of artifacts",
          "We went to see the Alcock and Brown Centenary exhibition which was excellent. It's not been well publishised nationwide which is difficult to understand. The other exibits were related to Swansea and again were very good. A small very relevant museum.",
          "Really enjoyed \"remembering Cefn Cross exhibition",
          "Interesting exhibitions with a nice atmosphere to the place. \nGreat exhibition on about Cefn Coed hospital currently...they always have good exhibitions that change. \nThey have permanant exhibitions too, like The Mummy - which is great!",
          "Great to see Hor, The Red Lady and Satan but 2 rooms closed and the colouring in room seems a waste of valuable space. Please open Landore to public",
          "Swansea Museum and welcoming staff  never fail to please. Current Cefn Coed Hospital exhibition is fascinating. RISW talks always of high quality.",

          "Went to see the Cefn Coed Hospital exhibition having worked there for fifteen years. Really enjoyed it.",
          "A nice selection of local history all under one roof but we managed to walk in and out of the building with no acknowledgment from the staff member who was on the phone the entire time.",
          "Interesting, friendly staff.",
          "My daughter enjoyed the mouse house provided. The gift shop could do with expanding e.g. some cheap pens, pencils, fridge magnets as no entry fees don't mind paying for a gift. The first world war exhibit was the best one. The mummy upstairs is wrapped up now, but still well worth a look.",
          "Great building, friendly staff. Some local history, a really good WW1 room with a trench set, the only Egyptian mummy in Wales (!) and a lot more Egyptology. Well worth a visit. 3 hour parking nearby in Gloucester Place and surrounding roads!",
          "My granddaughter loves visiting the museum lovely staff very friendly staff always brilliant displays",
          "Small, but of some interest",
          "Great museum with a very interesting history here. Would recommend you spend a free couple of hours here.",
          "This is a lovely museum which is due another visit soon. It has a typically grand Roman Senate style frontage, but when you get inside, the creaky floorboards and the crammed cabinets full of curios, give you a feel less of a museum than of \u2026",
          "Good opportunity to see the ancient Egyptian  mummy.",
          "I enjoyed the war exhibit (the recreated trench was really interesting and well put together)! The mummy room was also captivating. The rest of the museum left me feeling a bit disappointed.",

        "wiki": "Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914 \u2013 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" and \"And death shall have no dominion\"; the \"play for voices\" Under Milk Wood; and stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of Laugharne where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in the United States cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early time ===\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (n\u00e9e Williams; 1882\u20131958), a seamstress, and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school. Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906\u20131953), who was eight years his senior. The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home. Thomas's father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as \"son of the sea\", after Dylan ail Don, a character in The Mabinogion. His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles. Dylan, pronounced \u02c8 [\u02c8d\u0259lan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the \"dull one\". When he broadcast on Welsh BBC, early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth. His childhood featured regular summer trips to Llansteffan where his maternal relatives were the sixth generation to farm there. His mother's family, the Williamses, lived in such farms as Waunfwlchan, Llwyngwyn, Maesgwyn and Penycoed. The memory of Fernhill, a dairy farm owned by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones, is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem \"Fern Hill\". Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. Thomas was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, and he was skilful in gaining attention and sympathy. Thomas' formal education began at Mrs Hole's dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home. He described his experience there in Quite Early One Morning:\n\nNever was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime \u2013 the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.\n\nIn October 1925, Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys, in Mount Pleasant, where his father taught English. He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school, preferring reading. In his first year one of his poems was published in the school's magazine, and before he left he became its editor. During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks; the first poem, dated 27 April (1930), is entitled \"Osiris, come to Isis\". In June 1928 Thomas won the school's mile race, held at St. Helen's Ground; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas left school to become a reporter for the South Wales Daily Post, only to leave under pressure 18 months later. Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years, during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive and continued to add to his notebooks, amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934. Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.In his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the Little Theatre in Mumbles, visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea's pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles. In the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as \"The Kardomah Gang\". In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.\n\n\n=== 1933\u20131939 ===\nThomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: \"And death shall have no dominion\", \"Before I Knocked\" and \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\". \"And death shall have no dominion\" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" appeared in The Listener in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was \"the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years\". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves.  A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem \"The Hand That Signed the Paper\" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913\u201394), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish and French descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the \"poetic herald\" for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics. Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were \"intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory\". Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas's.During the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the communists, as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist. He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists.\n\n\n=== Wartime, 1939\u20131945 ===\nIn 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as  The Map of Love. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.At the outset of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as \"an unreliable lung\". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus. After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income. Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.In February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a \"three nights' blitz\". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: \"Our Swansea is dead\". Soon after the bombing raids, Thomas wrote a radio play, Return Journey Home, which described the caf\u00e9 as being \"razed to the snow\". The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Caf\u00e9 reopened on Portland Street after the war.In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin left their son with his grandmother at Blashford and moved to London. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI). After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post. Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, This Is Colour (a history of the British dyeing industry) and New Towns For Old (on post-war reconstruction). These Are The Men (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. Conquest of a Germ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. Our Country (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.In early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower; one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.In 1944, with the threat of German flying bombs on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaen Cwm near Llangain, where Thomas resumed writing poetry, completing \"Holy Spring\" and \"Vision and Prayer\". In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later work, Under Milk Wood. Of the poetry written at this time, of note is \"Fern Hill\", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid-1945.\n\n\n=== Broadcasting years 1945\u20131949 ===\n\nAlthough Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled \"Reminiscences of Childhood\" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded Quite Early One Morning (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite Early One Morning, and in the three years beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.\n\nBy late September 1945 the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London. The publication of Deaths and Entrances in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in The Spectator, \"This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet\".In the second half of 1945 Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, Book of Verse, broadcast weekly to the Far East. This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished. On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the Third Programme, a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas. He appeared in the play Comus for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus' Agamemnon and Satan in an adaptation of Paradise Lost. Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as \"useful should a younger generation poet be needed\". He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem. Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was \"in every sense a celebrity\".Thomas visited the home of historian A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking \"on a monumental scale\", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse. After a three-month holiday in Italy, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for Under Milk Wood. In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of \u00a32,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. Just before moving into there, Thomas rented \"Pelican House\" opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.\nCaitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949.\n\n\n=== American tours, 1950\u20131953 ===\nAmerican poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk \u2013 going out of his way to shock people \u2013 and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: \"Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?\" Caitlin said in her memoir, \"Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it.\"\nOn returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems, \"In the white giant's thigh\", which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950, and the incomplete \"In country heaven\". 1950 is also believed to be the year that he began work on Under Milk Wood, under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'. The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'. Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'. Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris describes as \"unusually blunt\"; the ribald \"Lament\" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father \"Do not go gentle into that good night\".Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot. Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there. She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat. Thomas would describe the flat as his \"London house of horror\" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin \u2013 after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip. They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements. The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year. One of his works recorded during this time, A Child's Christmas in Wales, became his most popular prose work in America. The original 1952 recording of A Child's Christmas in Wales was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is \"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\".In April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America. He performed a \"work in progress\" version of Under Milk Wood, solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.During this penultimate tour Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden.  They had discussions about collaborating on a \"musical theatrical work\" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of \"the rediscovery of love and language in what  might be left after the world after the bomb.\"  The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his In Memoriam Dylan Thomas for tenor, string quartet, and four trombones. The  first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.After returning home, Thomas worked on Under Milk Wood in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record Under Milk Wood. Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.Thomas's last collection Collected Poems, 1934\u20131952, published when he was 38, won the Foyle poetry prize. Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that \"Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language\". Thomas's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952. In the first few months of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills, three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nThomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by John Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain, there is no record that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox vaccination certificate.Plans called for a first appearance at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who was director of the Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he looked \"pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self\". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.The next day Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was \"rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything\".\n\nOn the evening of 27 October Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour. The next day he took part in Poetry and the Film, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2 am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, \"I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!\" The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11 pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58 am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that \"the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response\". Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, \"Is the bloody man dead yet?\" She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.It is also now believed, however, that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia, as well as emphysema, immediately before his death. In their 2004 book Dylan Remembered 1935\u20131953, Volume 2, David N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: \"The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right.\" Thomas died at noon on 9 November, having never recovered from his coma.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nRumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death. Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death \u2013 pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite the poet's heavy drinking, his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.The publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography Dylan Thomas in America cemented Thomas's legacy as the \"doomed poet\"; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas? claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner \"was even more culpable than his use of morphine\".Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, Caitlin Thomas \u2013 Leftover Life to Kill (1957) and My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story (1997), describe the  effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. \"Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet\", she wrote, and \"The bar was our altar.\" Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and  George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.Thomas died intestate, with assets to the value of \u00a3100. His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne. Thomas's funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin's Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas's coffin. Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side. The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown's Hotel. Thomas's fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote The Times obituary.Thomas's widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him. Thomas's father \"DJ\" died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas's elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012.\n\n\n== Poetry ==\n\n\n=== Poetic style and influences ===\nThomas's refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise. Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed. Instead Thomas is viewed as part of the modernism and romanticism movements, though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful. Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote \"... a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable.\" Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the villanelle \"Do not go gentle into that good night\". His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: \"My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy\".\n\nThomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having been influenced by the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas, finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas. Although Thomas described himself as the \"Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive\", he stated that the phrase \"Swansea's Rimbaud\" was coined by poet Roy Campbell. Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas's mythological pasts into his works such as \"The Orchards\", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the Mabinogion.\nThomas's poetry is notable for its musicality, most clear in \"Fern Hill\", \"In Country Sleep\", \"Ballad of the Long-legged Bait\" and \"In the White Giant's Thigh\" from Under Milk Wood.\nThomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were Mother Goose rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:\n\nI should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance ... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.\n\nThomas was an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.\n\n\n=== As a 'Welsh' poet ===\n\nThomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his Collected Poems, he added \"Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh.\" Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that \"His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background\". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked \"in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of.\"Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's \"whole attitude is that of the medieval bards.\" Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of cynghanedd (consonant harmony) or cerdd dafod (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry. Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: \"rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate.\" Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of cynghanedd in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, Thomas's first in-depth biographer, wrote \"No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan\".Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, \"Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it\". While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama The Three Weird Sisters. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled \"I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism.\" Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked \u2013 \"Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality\". Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of literary magazine Wales, Thomas's father wrote that he was \"afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman\". Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, \"Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry\", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication Llareggub Revisited, \"the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety\u2014not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him.\" The Poetry Archive notes that \"Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively\".Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance. Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947, \"Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding.\" Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading Eighteen Poems, \"The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with Poems and Ballads.\" Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that \"no one can 'stick words into us like pins'... like he [Thomas] can\", but followed that by stating that he \"doesn't use his words to any advantage\". Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.' In 1956, the publication of the anthology New Lines featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated \"Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing\".Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public. In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th. Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers. The BBC Radio programme, Desert Island Discs, in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording. John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common. He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become \"... an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism\", his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nIn Swansea's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour  with the closing lines from Fern Hill.\n\nThomas's home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council. Thomas's writing shed is also preserved. In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30. In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill.\nIn 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas's birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works. Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas's work shed, Sir Peter Blake's exhibition of illustrations based on Under Milk Wood and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas's work. The Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who made a recording of Fern Hill for the event.\n\n\n== List of works ==\n\nThe Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas: The New Centenary Edition.

          "This was an amazing day. I followed a sign - drove to the house - and phoned a number and booked a tour the next day around a lovingly restored suburban house that had been taken back to the time of Dylan Thomas childhood. The house had an incredible period atmosphere and was a",
          "I visited one afternoon only to see on the wall outside the front that house tours were closed. Beneath were the times 10:30am - 4:30pm, and it was only 3:30pm, so I was somewhat disappointed as it was my last day in Swansea. Despite this, it was good to look at the dwelling",
          "I was nervous on the front stoop, knowing where I was and how much change one boy would make on the world from upstairs in a tiny room. I will never be the same after seeing it.",
          "My aunt, uncle and I visited this spring and it was wonderful. So lovely that an individual has put so much into something he clearly loves. Very personal and lots of information! Would absolutely recommend for a fun and educational trip for families.",
          "We had a fabulous experience with our visit to Dylan's Birthplace. Geoff was really insightful and shared his journey with the amazing restoration from grotty student digs back to a true reflection of how the house would have been in Dylan's day. A true labour of love; heart,",
          "Four friends had a great tour of Dylan\u2019s house - had a few laughs with the guide, learned a lot, and we were taken back in time to his childhood.",
          "We have waited a long time to visit here but, well worth the visit. Laugharne itself is set on an estuary with idilic views, no wonder Dylan chose it to spend his time in. His house, workshop and boathouse were delightful and worth the climb to see them. Not suitable for anyone",
          "we enjoyed visiting this place. learning alot about this person, and taking it all in. my kids thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to see this place in a long time",
          "as I said been there a few times over the years as it's only about 3-4 miles from where I lived. never been in their it's in a tidy place to live, a few minutes away is what was his best drinking at the Uplands Tavern... then there is where he did a lot of his work think it's",
          "5 Cwmdonkin Drive is the \u2018absolute place\u2019 to visit if you\u2019re a Dylan Thomas fan, or in anyway interested in his work - the house offers a really great \u2018atmosphere\u2019 and wonderful insight into Dylan\u2019s formative years. The good people who \u2018rescued\u2019 this house and have so",
          "We stayed here for two nights whilst staying in Swansea for a concert. The house provides a rare opportunity to emerse yourself in welsh and litery culture and history. The house has been fully and truely restored by a hugely committed owner. everything in the house has been",
          "small but very interesting museum. My son was studying in Swansea and we had to hit this museum - tragic life!",
          "A great place to visit - very atmospheric and our host Geoff was full of interesting stories. The house has been decorated and preserved as it would have been in Dylan's time living there - so much attention to detail. We had booked afternoon tea - there were only 5 of us and",
          "I was fortunate enough to win a 2 night stay in this wonderful house. Geoff the owner met myself and my husband and gave us an in-depth tour of the house. He supplied us with a welcome pack to settle us in. From the moment I entered Dylan\u2019s birthplace up until the time we left,",
          "What an amazing way to celebrate my 70 th birthday with friends and family. A warm welcome , interesting and informative talk and a good wander around the house encouraged. Dinner was exquisite, local produce beautifully cooked and presented. A wonderful surprise for me was the",
          "This is a very interesting house to visit. It has been restored lovingly by Jeff and with the advice of the Thomas' maid, now dead. It gives a deep impression of what life was like for Dylan Thomas and his family. Jeff gave us an interesting little talk and we were then free to",
          "This was my third visit and each time the house doesn\u2019t disappoint. I keep recommending the house to friends as it is so interesting. We were greeted by Dot who gave us a warm welcome, an interesting talk and after we\u2019d looked around the house she served us tea and delicious",
          "The birth place takes you back and gives you an insight to the time of Dylan's spent at this memorable house.",
          "Can't believe we travelled from Doncaster to see Dylan and he was out of residence add to that no actual Wales in Wales and it's pretty disappointing all round,",
          "Came here on a cold rainy Welsh day and can't say enough about the thrill of seeing the house Dylan Thomas grew up in, and especially his room. After an introduction to how Thomas' family came to live there, and the various permutations of the house through the years, Geoff left",
          "What can I say? We stayed here one night late September and - after having a tour by the owner (I'm sorry I can't remember your name) - the place was ours. It was like living in a time capsule and almost as though Dylan Thomas had just popped out for a bit. Highly recommended.",
          "Myself and my brother visited this place last week, The Host was fabulous and has the house in A1 condition, The Host is obsessive of Dylan Thomas and im sure lives in his shoes.Its remarkable this house was built during the war and is grand indeed, Its without doubt that",
          "The tour of Dylan\u2019s birthplace was a great experience and an excellent insight into the early life of Dylan and his family. The tour guide, Clive, gave a relaxed informative talk and answered all our questions with great information. A lovely way to spend a few hours. For us",
          "What a marvellous visit we had to 5 Cwmdonkin Drive. As it said on the website, we phoned in advance to book a tour. Steve met us and we followed the self guided tour around. Really informative. The house has been restored beautifully, with meticulous attention to detail. Hard",
          "For anyone with an interest in the background to Thomas himself, and of course, to his poetry and other writing, a visit to 5 Cwmdonkin Drive is an absolute 100% must. The owner saved it from serious neglect and has brought the house back to how it would have felt and looked in",
          "Out of this world to step back in time to actually get to see where Dylan Thomas got his inspiration for his great works that are read by so many people & will live on forever loved it",
          "Advise visitors not to turn up at the house and expect it to be open. Beforehand visit the Dylan Thomas Birthplace website to check dates/times society members are available to conduct tours, then telephone the number listed in advance to arrange a convenient time to visit. We",
          "We entered a sort of treasure hunt which began at his home in Uplands Swansea.It was really interesting to see where and how he lived.We then had to visit some of his favourite haunts and take photos of things he liked about his Swansea.",
          "Geoff gave a tailored introductory talk but we bombarded him with questions, all of which he answered fully. He has an extensive knowledge of Dylan's life and poetry and had himself bought and authentically restored the house. It was poignant to wander through the rooms Dylan",
          "great project, very knowledgeable guide. Ring ahead to book your tour, personal storyteller guides you round and you have time to experience the formative home of Dylan. visit the park too, on road parking.",
          "Booked tour with the owner who was knowledgeable but also gave plenty of time for visitors to explore solo Great both for Dylan Thomas lovers and those who like period houses. In the future this house needs to be kept for posterity",
          "The Thomas's house has been carefully and lovingly restored, after many years of neglect and those who, like me, have a keen interest in Dylan's work and life, should not miss the opportunity to visit his birthplace. Geoff is a very friendly person, a fantastic host and a",
          "Been there at No.5 many times when I was the beat bobby for the Uplands, and to Laugharne as a child. DT is in my blood, especially Don\u2019t go quiet into the Dark night poem. Spen all my child hood down Laugharne with family, what a fantastic privilege it was to go into his place",
          "Geoff spoke to us at length about the Thomas family and the remarkable history and restoration of the house. We saw all the rooms and learned about how the Thomas family lived. We had to book the visit in advance so the experience was much more personal and bespoke.",
          "A very interesting experience. My husband and I were very impressed by how the house was run. The People involved obviously love what they are doing and gave us a very real feel to the house. They were very informative. Madeys feel as if we knew Dylan and his family.",
          "This is a very fine restoration done with loving attention to detail and historical accuracy. If you're even remotely interested in Dylan Thomas, you must visit. This is not a state or even locally supported attraction in terms of finances or marketing, but rather one person's",
          "you really do need to be into the writings of Dylan Thomas before you visit, if you are, you will understand, if it is just a name you have heard of, then I personally, feel it would be a waste of time",
          "Great place to visit,well recommended.Well done to the owners for this attraction in Cwmdonkin, Uplands.",
          "I have visited Thomas' bar and apartment in NYC now his birthplace in Swansea. so I guess I can die now.",
          "Been visiting this place since my childhood, my mum introduced me to works of Dylan Thomas. In my opinion schools should make children visit these places to keep the heritage alive.",
          "First of all, well done and thank you to the owners for making this place exist. Over the years, it's been shunned and given up by both Swansea Council and the National Trust. Considering how important Dylan Thomas is to Wales and Swansea, I can't understand this. The home has",
          "Saturday 12th May was a pleasant day, dry sunny but not too hot. We walked about two miles to Cwmdonkin Park. Anyone with any knowledge of the writer and poet Dylan Thomas would know that Cwmdonkin Park was a great source of inspiration for him as he lived only across the",
          "We visited Swansea for a Dylan Thomas inspired walk around the city, starting at the house where he was born. Indeed, we hadn't realised in advance that tours of the house were available. As we were there we called the number and agreed to meet with the owner a little later on",
          "In addition to the usual house tour, we also did the Cradle-to-Grave tour *and* we stayed in the house for four night. It was truly amazing, and the breadth of knowledge that Geoff brought to bear on the subject of the entire life of Dylan Thomas was fantastic. I would recommend",
          "This is a quirky and interesting experience run by knowledgeable enthusiasts - we loved it! We pre-booked to be sure it would be open.",
          "As suggested on the very good website, as it is not always open from 9 - 5, my brother had pre-booked our tour, so we were met exactly on time, by the owner/ guide, at the house. We were the only visitors at this time, and were given a warm welcome and friendly, very informative",
          "Geoff is a very friendly, informative and lovely host. He told us some fascinating anecdotes about Dylan\u2019s life. The attention to detail in the house was impressive down to the scrunched up paper under his desk, immersing us into Dylan\u2019s world. The afternoon tea was wonderful",
          "We recently visited Wales - inspired by my longtime fascination with Dylan Thomas... Our trip would not have been complete without this amazing visit to his boyhood home. Our guide was filled with facts and observations about the Thomas family and the restoration of the home was",
          "Excellent! The house has been lovingly restored, using the testimony of the Thomas family maid and others who remembered it from when they lived here from 1914-37. This was a 3 year labour of love for its manager. He painstakingly assembled furniture and fittings that would have",
          "For all Dylan Thomas fans, this is a must. Take the conducted tour of the house and listen to the history and life story of Dyland Thomas. See where he did his writing and learn about his family and younger days. At Christmas, you can attend A Child's Christmas in Wales, read by",
          "Well I was certainly captivated, enthralled and fascinated by the whole experience of visiting 5 Cymdonkin Drive. What a find.! I love to find places like this where history has been made and now brought back to life. A living family home, recreated with amazing attention to",
          "I would advise anyone thinking of visiting the house to look at the website first and book in advance. We arranged our visit by email 2 days in advance and although Geoff was not available, he arranged for Clive to meet us at the house and show us round. We were also greeted, in",
          "It was belting down with rain on Saturday 30th September, so after reading the brochure about 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, we decided to drive to Swansea to learn more of Dylan Thomas's doings in his early life. After a longish drive, we followed the brown tourist signs and went up the",
          "It should be said at the outset that if you turn up on spec you may have to ring a number to say that you want a tour. Geoff was 10 minutes away and arrived promptly to give us and another small group a personal introduction to the house and Dylan Thomas. Then we could wander",
          "Having stayed in Laugharne several times, and sought out the Fitzrovia pubs that Dylan Thomas frequented in his youth, his Birthplace was another point on the map that we'd always meant to visit. Not knowing too much about it, I emailed Geoff last week and arranged to see the",
          "There is a bus from Swansea the 5 which takes you up the hill to the house, we went thinking the house would be open, but it was closed with a notice giving a phone number to ring. Unfortunately the person answering the phone was at a meeting so could not open the house, so",
          "You do not have to be a Dylan Thomas fan to appreciate this absolute gem of a house. Thanks to the incredible, painstaking work of the delightful custodian Geoff, you will be transported back in time and feel a tangible connection to the days when Dylan wrote here. The attention",
          "We went for the tour of the Edwardian house predominantly. Neither of us had any real experience of Dylan Thomas' work but as we were in Swansea decided to cycle over there and get an introduction to his work. We read a few of his poems as research and got interested.",
          "Offering Cwmdonkin Drive as overnight accommodation is a step too far which it cannot facilitate. Even the most basic requirements of overnight accommodation are not met. The literature advertised 'a continental breakfast basket to use during your stay'. The reality was",
          "I felt very privileged to have seen and explored young Dylan's family home. Geoff has painstakingly created the fabric of the home from interviewing staff who worked for the family friends and family. This is very much of a labour of love for Geoff and his group of",
          "A fine day for a hike up a steep, breath blasting hill, that leads to Cwmdonkin Drive. No 5 was nearly at the crest, overlooking the Cwmdonkin Park that had Dylan Thomas spouting out, loud and shrill, over the red chimney pots of his 1920s\u2019 Swansea home town.",
          "This was my second visit, I live in Swansea now and as friends were visiting me who hadn't been to the house, I decided to take them along. The tour and talk is fascinating and as the groups are small you are able to explore freely. You get a feel for Dylan's life, the",
          "It's best to book a visit which we did. Travelled there by a local bus from our hotel in Mumbles.If you decide to walk up to the house from the bottom of the hill be careful because it's is very steep. We were greeted by the owner who was very friendly and made us feel welcome.",
          "You need to book for the organised tour around Dylan`s birthplace. Best to travel by taxi as steep road that is not suitable for people with mobility issues. Once there all is fine..good tour with plenty of explanations of how the home was restored in the last 10 years to that",
          "The Dylan Thomas House has been restored as a home. The house itself is a work of art. When you reserve the accommodation, you get to use the whole house. We were greeted by the owner, given a cup of tea, told the history of the house and the renovation and a taken on a tour",
          "It is free, so nothing lost if you don't really like it. If you are a fan you will be fascinated by the sound recordings and photos.",
          "My 12 year old daughter and I visited 5 Cwmdonkin Drive yesterday to supplement her curriculum in school. We arrived at the house and rang the telephone number to arrange an appointment. In hindsight, I should have phoned earlier than the day of the visit. However, we were",

          "The quality of the restoration of Dylan's childhood home has to be experienced to be believed. Over a 'cuppa' in the parlor Annie (proprietor & restorer) told me that she still marvels that the property was not subject to the typical 1960's 'modernisation' i.e. the ripping out",
          "I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Dylan Thomas Birthplace. Annie Haden has done a wonderful job of renovating the house, she has poured her heart and soul into it and as soon as you walk through the door you feel like you are in a real home as opposed to a museum or",

          "Dylan Thomas was born in this house and lived nearly half of his whole life in Swansea. This house was one of the landmarks in his life, in his works for sure. Except for DT Centre nearby Swansea Museum, this is another important place to visit for DT's fans or travellers. DT",
          "As some one born and bred in Swansea, an inspired birthday present from a friend led to my visiting this wonderful place. The house is not only a magical step back in time where you can truly imagine the Thomas family living, but the experience is made all the more enchanting by",
          "Walking through the house provides a great insight into Dylan Thomas, his stories, and poetry. You can see and feel the parlour full of uncles, the kitchen full of scurrying aunts, and the overarching presence of his father. The house has been restored with astonishing attention",
          "5 Cwmdonkin Drive is among the most important sites for mythopoetic contemplation on Planet Earth. A stay under this roof is an unparalleled opportunity for anyone who finds such a time-travel notion to be intriguing\u2014or compelling.",
          "What a fantastic experience! To think...we drank coffee from the same mugs as Prince Charles (affectionately known as Chazza). And then there was the house itself, immaculately preserved and maintained: we were guided around with expertise. I can honestly say that I have learned",

          "I don't know of anywhere else in the world that you can sit down for dinner with your friends in the very home where a poet was born and brought up. They have the period of the house spot on and you can imagine exactly what home life must have been like for the young Dylan.",
          "Everyday life on the Wales seacoast is vivid in Dylan Thomas's poems, stories, and radio broadcasts. You can stay at his childhood home, the setting of the popular story \"A Child's Christmas in Wales.\" Anne Haden, the owner, has lovingly restored the house to the way it was in",

          "Our visit to 5 Cwmdonkin was a great joy and a wonderful way to spend a morning in Swansea. I'd been to Laugharne and to the White Horse Inn, New York. This was the start of the story of Dylan Thomas's life and I loved all the rooms, carefully and lovingly restored. I loved",
          "Keen admirers of Dylan Thomas, both his life and works, we spent over 10 years visiting & staying in Laugharne, where the surroundings gave a fascinating insight into what inspired some of Dylan's compositions. Until now we had only seen the outside of No 5 and nearby",

          "Visited this house to kill some time, not expecting what a memorable experience it would be. It transports you back to the early 20th century, each room faithfully recreated - truly a labour of love. First you are offered tea in the drawing room while you listen to the guide",

        "wiki": "Swansea University (Welsh: Prifysgol Abertawe) is a public research university located in Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom. It was chartered as University College of Swansea in 1920, as the fourth college of the University of Wales. In 1996, it changed its name to the University of Wales Swansea following structural changes within the University of Wales. The title of Swansea University was formally adopted on 1 September 2007 when the University of Wales became a non-membership confederal institution and the former members became universities in their own right.Swansea University has 8 colleges spread across its two campuses which are located on the coastline of Swansea Bay.  The Singleton Park Campus is set in the grounds of Singleton Park to the west of Swansea city centre. The \u00a3450 million Bay Campus, which opened in September 2015, is located adjacent to Jersey Marine Beach to the east of Swansea city centre which is in the Neath Port Talbot Area.\nIt is the third largest university in Wales in terms of number of students. It currently offers about 330 undergraduate courses and 120 post-graduate courses to 20,620 undergraduate and postgraduate students. In 2014 Swansea was named University of the Year in the WhatUni.com Student Choice Awards and shortlisted in the same category in the Times Higher Education awards.In 2016, Swansea University was named as the best university in Wales by The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2017 League Table. It was also awarded the inaugural Welsh University of the Year title.In 2017, Hillary Rodham Clinton received an honorary doctorate at Swansea University and unveiled a commemorative stone to mark the renaming of the College of Law to the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundations ===\n\nThe University College, Swansea, (as it was known then), was established in 1920, opening its doors on 5 October. At the time, it was the youngest of the four colleges of the University of Wales. It was established on the recommendations of a Royal Commission set up in 1916. The college was founded on what were perceived as the needs and the wants of the local area, and Swansea's main industries in particular.\n\nThe Park Campus houses the oldest parts of the university's estate, including Singleton Abbey, a large eighteenth-century mansion which was the ancestral home of the Vivian family, having been bought by the prominent industrialist, John Henry Vivian.\nSwansea University's foundation stone was laid in 1920 by King George V in July 1920, welcoming 89 students, of whom eight were female. Subjects taught from the beginning of the College were the Sciences, Mathematics, Metallurgy and Engineering. The professors were A.R. Richardson (Mathematics), E.J. Evans (Physics), J.E. Coates (Chemistry), A.E. Trueman (Geology), C.A. Edwards (Metallurgy) and F. Bacon (Engineering).\nThe university was granted a coat of arms by the College of Heralds in 1921 with the motto Gweddw Crefft Heb Ei Dawn, translated as Technical Skill is Bereft Without Culture.Arts subjects were not taught immediately in 1920, but started in the following 'session', 1921\u201322. The first professors in those initial departments were D. Emrys Evans (Classics), W.D. Thomas (English Language and Literature), Henry Lewis (Welsh), E. Ernest Hughes (History), F.A. Cavenagh (Education) and Mary Williams (French). Williams was the first woman to be appointed to a Chair in the United Kingdom. This met with some reaction from senior men at the College, one of whom she would later marry.\nSaunders Lewis, the well-known Welsh language writer and activist, became a member of staff in 1922 although he ran up against controversy in 1936/37 for trying to set fire to a Royal Air Force bombing school on the Llyn Peninsula. He was tried at the Old Bailey and sent to prison for nine months.When Singleton Abbey and its surrounding land was handed to the college in 1923, Arts subjects were moved there from the College's temporary site in Mount Pleasant. Student numbers remained relatively small until the Second World War.\nSwansea acquired departments of Philosophy 1925, German in 1931, economics in 1937, Social Policy in 1947, Political Theory and Government in 1954 \u2013 the same year that a civil engineering and a Geography department were added. In 1961 Swansea became a centre for Russian and East European Studies, whilst Italian and Spanish joined the Department of French.\nThere were many notable staff members at the University in the period, including the long-serving female professor of Botany, Florence Mockeridge. Another was Professor Glanmor Williams (History) who retired in 1982.  Other well-known staff members were the author of novels such as Lucky Jim and That Uncertain Feeling, Kingsley Amis, who lectured in English in the 1950s and early 1960s; Rush Rhees, an expert on Wittgensteinian philosophy, who was a member of staff from 1940 to 1966; and Kenneth O. Morgan (now Lord Morgan of Aberdyfi) who was a junior history lecturer from 1958 to 1966.\n\n\n=== Post-war campus development ===\nIn 1947, John Fulton, Baron Fulton, the University Principal, had designs on creating the UK's first contained university campus. Located in the vast expanse of Singleton Park, the university only had 2 permanent buildings; Singleton Abbey and the library.\nThe 1960s saw the university embark on a large campus development programme, aiming to fulfill Fulton's plan of becoming a self-contained community within the city. Along with new halls of residence, a Maths and Science Tower was built, with College House \u2013 later renamed Fulton House.\n\n\n== Campus ==\n\nFor most of its history, Swansea University operated exclusively from the Singleton Park Campus. However, owing to rapid expansion, the university developed a 65-acre, \u00a3450 million beachfront science and innovation Bay Campus which opened in September 2015. Since 2015, Swansea University has operated as a dual-campus university with the 'Park Campus' located in its traditional Singleton Park grounds, and the Bay Campus, at Crymlyn Burrows.\nThe Bay campus has been developed on a 65-acre beachfront site between Fabian Way and Jersey Marine beach at Crymlyn Burrows. It initially houses the College of Engineering and School of Management, a Great Hall seating 800, a library offering views over a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and student accommodation. Projects moving on to campus include the UK's first Energy Safety Research Institute, and the Institute of Structural Materials, home to the University Technology Centre for Rolls Royce materials testing.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSwansea University's \u00a320 million International Sports Village is five minutes' walk from the Singleton Park campus on the western side of Sketty Lane. It has an eight-lane track, six-lane indoor track and training centre, floodlit playing fields including rugby, football, lacrosse and cricket pitches, two artificial hockey pitches, a sports hall, tennis and squash courts, a climbing wall and spin room. The University also owns training pitches in the north of the city, in Fairwood, which it has developed alongside Swansea City A.F.C..During the 2012 Summer Olympics, the University hosted the training camps for the Mexican and New Zealand Paralympic teams and the Ireland Triathlon team. In 2014, it hosted the IPC Athletics European Championships. Furthermore, in 2015 it hosted the training camps of the Canada national rugby union team and the Fiji national rugby union team in preparation for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Sports Science at the university leapt from 40th to 8th in the 2015 Guardian University Guide. The department has links with Swansea City A.F.C., Ospreys and Welsh Athletics. Former scholars include Wales rugby union player Alun Wyn Jones, Olympic swimmer Georgia Davies, Paralympian swimmer Liz Johnson and Paralympian Boccia player David Smith. Swansea is in the top quarter of the British University's sporting leagues. It competes with Cardiff University in the Welsh Varsity tournament, the largest student sports event in Wales. This includes The Welsh Boat Race and the showcase rugby union varsity match which attracted 16,000 students to Swansea's Liberty Stadium in 2015.\n\n\n==== Wales National Pool ====\n\nThe Wales National Pool, next to the International Sports Village, is a 50-metre pool built to FINA standards. The facility, which also has a 25m \u00d7 9.5m training pool and 1,200 spectator seats, is HQ of Wales Amateur Swimming Association.\nThe pool, one of five of British Swimming's Intensive Training Centres (ITC), was used to train swimmers for the London 2012 Olympics was built with funding from Sport Wales, Swansea Council and Swansea University.\nIt is home to the new Welsh Swimming National Performance Centre, a hub for elite and performance swimming in Wales including disability swimming under renowned coach Billy Pye who has trained several Paralympians in Swansea, including Ellie Simmonds and Liz Johnson. University sports science researchers provide back-up to the hub. The centre is also home to Swansea University Swimming and City of Swansea Aquatics.\n\n\n==== 360 Beach and Water Sports Centre ====\n\nThe \u00a31.4 million 360 Beach and Water Sports Centre is the only university-operated centre of its kind in the UK. It is on the prom a five-minute walk from the Singleton Park Campus.\nThe centre, opened in autumn 2012, is a not for profit company set up by Swansea University offering a range of activities and training such as kite surfing, paddle boarding, kayaking and beach volleyball. It houses a beachside bistro open to the public.On 5 September 2018, 360 Beach and Water Sports Centre shut down, with intentions of changing management. As of November 2018, it remains closed.\n\n\n=== Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (Egypt Centre) ===\nLocated in the Taliesin building, the Egypt Centre is open to the public. More than 4,000 items are in its collection. Most were collected by the pharmacist and entrepreneur Sir Henry Wellcome. Others came from the British Museum, the Royal Edinburgh Museum, National Museums and Galleries of Wales Cardiff, the Royal Albert Museum and Art Gallery and private donors.\nStaff lecture museum groups and other outside bodies on volunteering, social inclusion and how to widen community participation with university museums. School parties regularly visit for interactive events.\n\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nSwansea received its royal charter in 1920 and like many universities is governed by its constitution that is set out in its statutes and a charter. The governing body of Swansea University is its Council, which is supported by the Senate and the Court.\n\nThe Council consists of 29 members including the Chancellor, Pro-chancellors, Vice-chancellor, Treasurer, Pro-vice-chancellors, staff and student members, city council representation and a majority of lay members.  The council is responsible for all of the University's activities and has a well-developed committee structure to help discharge its powers and duties.\nThe Senate is the main academic body of the university and is responsible for teaching and research. Most of its 200 members are academics but it also includes representatives of the Students' Union and the Athletic Union. The Senate is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, who is the head of the university both academically and administratively.\nThe Court consists of more than 300 members representing stakeholders from local to national institutions. It meets annually to discuss the university's annual report, its financial statements and issues in higher education.\n\n\n=== List of Vice-Chancellors ===\n\nPrincipal\n\n1920 to 1926: Franklin Sibly; first principal\n1947 to 1959: John Fulton\n1965 to 1974: Frank Llewellyn Jones\n1974 to 1982: Robert Walter SteelVice-Chancellor\n\n1994 to 2003: Robin Williams\n2003 to 2019: Richard B.

        "wiki": "Swansea (; Welsh: Abertawe [ab\u025br\u02c8taw\u025b]) is a coastal city and county, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe) in Wales. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of G\u0175yr on the southwest coast. The county area includes Swansea Bay (Welsh: Bae Abertawe) and the Gower Peninsula. Swansea is the second largest city in Wales and the twenty-fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. According to Swansea Council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014, the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. Together with Neath and Port Talbot, Swansea formed a wider Urban Area of 300,352 in 2011.\nDuring the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname Copperopolis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological finds in the Swansea area come mostly from the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans occupied the area.\nThe two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes through the city centre and the Loughor which marks the northern border with Carmarthenshire. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to Mouth of the Tawe. It first appears c.1150 as Aper Tyui.Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its English name may derive from Sveinn's island \u2013 Old Norse: Sveinsey \u2013 the reference to an island may refer either to a bank at the mouth of the River Tawe or to an area of raised ground in marshes. An alternative explanation derives the place name from the Norse personal name Sweyn and ey, which can mean \"inlet\". This explanation supports the tradition that the city was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (reigned in Denmark from 986 to 1014). The name is pronounced Swans-y /\u02c8sw\u0252nzi/), not Swan-sea.The earliest known form of the modern name, Sweynesse, appears in the first charter, granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as Sweyneshe. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.Following the Norman conquest, a marcher lordship was granted by Henry I under the title of Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nFrom the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.\nThe port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed \"Copperopolis\". From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%\u2014the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales\u2014in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from \u00a3112 in 1860 to \u00a335 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.\nThe Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThrough the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.\n\nIn the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz').\nIn 1969 Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.\nIt backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe \"City and County of Swansea\" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.\nThe local government area is 378 square kilometres (146 sq mi) in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering 4,562 acres (1,846 ha) in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status, and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe).Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.\n\n\n=== Welsh Parliament ===\nThe Welsh Parliament constituencies are:\n\nGower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016\nSwansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011\nSwansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011The city is also part of the South Wales West regional constituency and is served by Suzy Davies MS (Conservative), Bethan Jenkins MS (Plaid Cymru), Caroline Jones MS (UKIP) and Dai Lloyd MS (Plaid Cymru).\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK parliamentary constituencies in Swansea are:\n\nGower, current MP is Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour since 2017\nSwansea East, current MP is, Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2015\nSwansea West, current MP is Geraint Davies, Labour since 2010\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSwansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula to the west was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.\nThe most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast\u2014the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.\nThe geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to 185 metres (607 ft) range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to 193 metres (633 ft) high. The highest point is located Penlle'r Castell at 374 metres (1,227 ft) on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate. As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic. In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrom 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. \nAround 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.

It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.\nFluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.\nIn 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at \u00a318 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSwansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.\n\n\n=== Welsh language ===\nThere are many Welsh language chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward Mawr are able to speak Welsh, as can 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nLocal produce includes cockles and laverbread sourced from the Loughor estuary. Salt marsh lamb, raised in the salt marshes of the estuary, is also a local speciality.\n\n\n=== Listed buildings ===\n\nThe city has three Grade One listed buildings: Swansea Castle, the Tabernacle Chapel, Morriston and the Swansea Guildhall. Swansea Castle was an impressive building occupying a strategic position above the River Tawe. The ruins that are visible today date from the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the \"Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales\" and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is \"the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered\". The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered \"the most important building in Wales of its period\".\n\nIn addition to these there are a number of Grade II* listed buildings; Ebenezer Baptist Chapel and its Hall in Ebenezer Street; the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery; the Midland Bank building; the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Kingsway, along with its Hall and School blocks; the Offices of Associated British Ports in Pier Street; the Royal Institution of South Wales building, now Swansea Museum in Victoria Road; and the Old Guildhall in Somerset Place.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nThe poet Dylan Thomas is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; his take on Swansea was that it was an \"ugly lovely town\". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Caf\u00e9 which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city. Their wealth and influence came from large copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector Dynevor School, Swansea before reading theology at Christ's College, Cambridge.

Playing out of St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including Billy Bancroft and Billy Trew, they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.\nIn 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Ospreys. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.\nSt Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there. In this ground, Sir Garfield Sobers hit six sixes in one over; the first time this was achieved in a game of first-class cricket. The final ball landed on the ground past the Cricketers' pub just outside the ground. It is also the home of the tallest floodlight stand in Europe.Swansea's rugby league side plays 13 miles (21 km) from Swansea in the small town of Ystalyfera.

The Catholic see is based in Swansea at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Greenhill area.\n\nSwansea, like Wales in general, has seen many Non-conformist religious revivals. In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.\nThe Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church. The church has an organ by Harrison & Harrison.\n\nThe Norwegian Church is a Grade II listed building in the docklands area of the city. The church building was originally located at Newport Docks. The building consists of a Seaman's Mission to the west end and a single gothic church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship for Norwegian sailors when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket on the River Tawe.\nThe city is home to 10% of the total Welsh Muslim population; Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new central mosque and community centre in the former St. Andrew's United Reformed Church. This would replace the existing central Mosque on St Helens Road and be in addition to the other three existing mosques (Swansea University Mosque, Hafod Mosque, Imam Khoei Mosque).Swansea is represented in Buddhism with the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Pulpung Changchub Dargyeling (Kagyu Tradition) and a branch of the international Dzogchen Community (Nyingma Tradition).

A large area of the city is earmarked for redevelopment. A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated St. David's Shopping Centre which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city's Sainsbury's store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans \u2013 Castle Street development. New green spaces will be provided in conjunction with the proposed Quadrant Square and Grand Theatre Square. Redevelopment of the Oxford Street car park and Lower Oxford Street arcades are also planned.At the sea front, The Tower, Meridian Quay is now Wales's tallest building at a height of 107 metres (351 ft) with a restaurant on the top (29th) floor. It was under construction adjacent Swansea Marina until 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSwansea originally developed as centre for metals and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in public administration, education & health and banking, finance & insurance, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average. In 2005, GVA per head in Swansea was \u00a314,302 \u2013 nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average.

Gower also claims Britain's Best Beach, Three Cliffs Bay. The Gower landmark topped the BBC Holiday Hit Squad nationwide competition (2006) and was voted Britain's best camping beach by The Independent thanks to its superb setting and quiet location (2007). Three Cliffs Bay also made the final of the ITV series Britain's Favourite View \u2013 the only nomination in Wales and backed by singer Katherine Jenkins. Nearby Brandy Cove came sixth in an online poll to find the UK's top beach for the baby boomer generation (2006). Beaches which won 2006 Blue Flag Beach Awards are: Bracelet Bay, Caswell Bay, Langland Bay, Port Eynon Bay and Swansea Marina (one of the few Blue Flag Marinas in Wales). All of these beaches also won a Seaside Award 2006. Limeslade was awarded the Rural Seaside Award and the Green Coast Award. Other Green Coast Awards went to Pwll Du, Rhossili Bay and Tor Bay.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nSwansea has a range of activities including sailing, water skiing, surfing, and other watersports, walking and cycling.

          "This isn't the sort of place that you make a special trip for. It is small and has a few signs telling you about the history of the site. The history is interesting but the castle itself has more potential than it is currently reaching. If possible, it would be ideal to do some",
          "Tells you all you need to know about the citys ambition - no investment in the old or the new , left to rot everything. The castle, the city, the people. Swansea council, welsh gov and uk gov apparently not at all bothered to let it all go to ruin",

          "This castle ruin is not really a tourist attraction, in that it is hardly worth taking a trip to see it. But it is interesting that it stands near the middle of the city. There are a few ruined walls, but any gateways are barred. I saw one explanatory notice, but it was quite",

          "Not much to say about it to be honest. Recently they built a tiny little 'park' next to it with benches. It somewhat made it better I guess, but it's just really tiny. Kind of out of place really. Would prefer if there was more 'green' around it, not pubs and restaurants.",

          "You can sit down right next to it.",
          "Not much there as Welsh Castles go but it looks great in the city centre amongst modern buildings.\n\nSpend 5 minutes here looking over Castle Gardens the pop to Wind Street for an alcoholic beverage!",

          "Because its part of our history of our very lovely city,witch I love very much and it can't be taken away from me.",
          "It is okay I guess",
          "You can come and sit outside what little is left of the castle, but so far as I know you can\u2019t access it in any way. The bit remaining is in pretty good nick and close to full height throughout. Which is rare on more complete Welsh castles \u2026",
          "Excellent place to visit",
          "Great little ruin of a castle, nestled within the grim brutalist of 60s architecture. Part was knocked down for office space.",

          "A medieval frontier town, Swansea is where the amazing journey of the Hanged Man in the St Thomas Way Story begins. \n\nThe natural landscape of Swansea was very different in medieval times. Perhaps most strikingly, the River Tawe flowed \u2026",

          "I wish Swansea Council would restore thr Castle to what it was like before the Luftwaffe bombed it.",
          "Not much to see, can also be the sight out uncleanliness",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Brynmill is a suburb of the City and County of Swansea, Wales, UK.  It lies about two miles (3 km) to the west of Swansea city centre.  It is a residential area forming the southern part of the Uplands electoral ward.  As it is close to Swansea University, many students choose to rent rooms here during term time.  Aside from the student population, this is a fairly middle-class area.\nBrynmill is approximately bounded by Swansea Bay to the south; Brynmill Lane to the west; Glanbrydan Avenue to the north; Bryn-y-Mor Road to the north-east; and Guildhall Road to the south-east.  Brynmill can be further subdivided between the upland area of Brynmill proper and the lowland area of St. Helen's close the sea.\nBrynmill is situated on hilly terrain. Many of the properties are built on slopes. Property subsidence is a problem here. Property prices here are around the national average.  Council tax rates here are quite high. The area offers convenient access to the city centre shopping area via the Oystermouth Road to the South, and Sketty Road to the North.  However, these roads are rather congested during peak hours.\n\n\n== Local amenities ==\n\nThe parish church of St Gabriel's (Church in Wales/Anglican) was consecrated in 1889. It is situated on Bryn Road. St. Benedict's Roman Catholic Church is on Sketty Road.  The local primary schools are Brynmill Primary School and Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Bryn-y-mor. The St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is located to the South of Brynmill.  St. Helen's also plays host to the annual Guy Fawkes night fireworks display.\nTo the east of the district is the Swansea Guildhall complex, with its tall clock tower being visible from a distance.  The Guildhall houses the City and County of Swansea council offices.  The Northern section of the Guildhall complex houses law courts. The Southern part of the Guildhall complex houses the Brangwyn Hall\u2014a venue for social and cultural functions in Swansea.  This is a venue for performances of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales when they visit Swansea.  This is also used as the venue for graduation ceremonies for new graduates from Swansea University.\n\n\n=== Waterfront ===\nThe Swansea waterfront promenade and cycle track crosses Brynmill across its southern boundary.  This is just a few metres away from St. Helen's.  Situated here is a war memorial and a memorial to Swansea Jack.  The truss structure of the Oystermouth Bridge (a.k.a. Slip Bridge) is now located here.  The terminus of the Mumbles land train is situated here.\nImmediately south of the promenade lies Swansea Bay.  Here is a large sandy beach with fairly calm waters and a very large tidal range.  At high tide, the beach is almost entirely covered by Swansea Bay's waters.  At low tide, it is about 1/4 mile walk to the water front.\nDirectly west of St. Helen's is the recreation ground. This is a venue used to host travelling funfairs and circuses.  It has hosted the Moscow State Circus, the Chinese State Circus, and Gerry Cottle's Circus. The Rec, as it is referred to by locals, is also host to a seasonal Park and ride car park.\n\n\n=== Victoria Park ===\nTo the East of St. Helen's is Victoria Park, containing bowling greens and tennis courts.  For younger children, there are swings to play on.  Victoria Park contains the Patti Pavilion, which serves as a village hall, and is a venue for village f\u00eates, pantomime, and other theatrical entertainment, as well as music gigs.  Located at the South East corner of Victoria Park is a weather station containing a Stevenson screen.\n\n\n=== Brynmill Park ===\nBrynmill Park is the local park which is separated from Singleton Park by Brynmill Lane.  Brynmill Park is a Victorian park, and contains a lake, which supports a population of whooper swans.  The lake was originally constructed as a reservoir, before being converted to recreational use.\nIn 2007, restoration work started at Brynmill Park to restore the facility to its Victorian splendour. Work at the park's play area will formed a \u00a31.3 million scheme led by Swansea Council and part-funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nLocal councillor Peter May and the Friends of Brynmill Park have also been actively involved in the initiative. The project will incorporate the restoration of the existing bowls pavilion and a new discovery centre offering multifunctional educational facilities.\nOther aspects of the Brynmill Park project include:\n\nThe installation of two floating nesting islands on the lake to improve habitats for wild birds.\nVarious aquatic planting at four areas of the lake, a reedbed and a variety of water lilies and marginal plants at the south western lake inlet.\nThe re-surfacing of paths and the installation of new seats and bins.\nThe refurbishment of railings and gates.\nThe demolition of the old OAP Pavilion and toilet block and the construction of temporary toilets beside the bowling green.\nThe improvement of the large lawned area to the eastern side of the lake by sand slitting and connection to a restored drainage system.\nThe repairing of part of the stone wall that forms the lake edge on the north western side of the park.Singleton Park houses the Brynmill Stream which was once the town boundary, and which was being used to power a corn mill as far back the fifteenth century.

        "wiki": "The Glynn Vivian Art Gallery is the public art gallery of the City and County of Swansea, in Wales, United Kingdom. The gallery is situated in Alexandra Road, near Swansea railway station, opposite the old Swansea Central Library.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe creation of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery was made possible when in 1905 Richard Glynn Vivian offered his collection of paintings, drawings and china to the City with an endowment of \u00a310,000. The donor laid the foundation stone himself in 1909, but it was after his death that the Gallery was formally opened in 1911, with \"great enthusiasm and gaiety.\" The building was designed by Glendinning Moxham in the Edwardian Baroque style. William Grant Murray, director of the Swansea Art School, became the Gallery's first director; since 1951 the Gallery has had its own Curator.\nRichard Glynn Vivian's collection, like most private collections, was eclectic. By donations \u2013 including the Deffett Francis collection of prints and drawings and the K. S. Meager bequest of Swansea china \u2013 and by purchases the Gallery's holdings have become more representative of the range of European art, while remaining rich in the work of local artists.\nThe Gallery also presents loan exhibitions and events, and has an educational programme.\n\n\n== Refurbishment 2011 ==\nIn October 2011 the gallery was closed temporarily for a \u00a36 million refurbishment and recladding of the 1974 extension. During the closure, the gallery planned to continue a programme of activities using alternative local venues. The former chair of the Arts Council of Wales was quoted as saying \"The Glynn Vivian is a major civic facility and the only purpose-built art gallery in Wales that is still open. It will be missed by the people of Swansea but they will welcome it back in its renewed form\". The work schedule was extended by two years after the original contractor went in to administration. The building re-opened in 2016.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe gallery displays a broad spectrum of visual arts from the original bequest of Richard Glynn Vivian (1835\u20131910), and includes work by Old Masters as well as an international collection of porcelain and Swansea china.\nThe paintings include work by Richard Wilson, Claude Monet, Thomas Jones, Mark Gertler, Augustus John, Gwen John, Stanley Spencer, Lucien Pissarro, Paul Nash, Guido Reni, Cedric Morris, Ben Nicholson, Alfred Janes, Ceri Richards, Ivon Hitchens, Thomas Lawrence, H. Scott Tuke, Ryszard Zajac, Evan Walters and Kyffin Williams.Among the prints may be found work by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Agostino Carracci, William Blake and Ceri Richards.\nWatercolours and drawings include work by Richard Wilson, Thomas Gainsborough, John Sell Cotman, Thomas Rowlandson, Richard Parkes Bonington, Gwen John and Ceri Richards.\nThe Gallery has an extensive collection of Swansea porcelain and china, as well as select pieces of other British and European factories, and of British and French glass. Among these is one of the earliest examples of European porcelain, a Meissen experimental vase complete with AR mark.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPaintings at Glynn Vivian Art Gallery on Your Paintings (BBC)",

          "This gallery does not seem to be marketed well. It is just a four minute stroll from the railway station and only a ten minute walk from the town centre. It is well set out and worth visiting for the exhibits alone, although there is also a constant agenda of events. On the day",
          "This is a wonderful gallery because the building and the exhibitions marry together so well. The display of artefacts, ceramics, and objets d'art from the massive collection of Glynn Vivian himself are brilliantly displayed and cannot fail to impress in their range. It is well",
          "We went yesterday for a guided tour fo the gallery and were fortunate to be taken behind the scenes to see the work of the picture restorer and for a look at the picture storage area. Best of all was the guided tour by Jenni Spencer Davies the curator who gave us a very good",

          "First time here since the refurb. The gallery has a very relaxed atmosphere, almost serene. This is largely one man's personal collection and ongoing legacy which engenders admiration in itself. I would like to see more art, I do know there are pieces in storage so maybe they",

        "wiki": "Clyne Gardens is a botanical garden located in Swansea, Wales, UK. The current park was formed from the landscaped gardens created by Glynn Vivian of the Vivian family who purchased Clyne Castle in 1860. The estate passed to his nephew Algernon, 'The Admiral' in 1921 who owned it until his death in 1952. He had the greatest influence on the gardens as we see them today. Clyne Gardens is bordered by Mumbles road and Mayals road in Blackpill and Mayals areas of Swansea with entrances off both these roads. \n\n\n== Attractions ==\nThe gardens consist of 19 hectares of land and include over 2,000 different plants including over 800 rhododendrons for which the gardens are renowned. Clyne holds National Collections of Pieris, Enkianthus and Rhododendrons. Due to the cool, wet and temperate local climate many plants thrive here not normally considered hardy for its latitude. The gardens have extensive bog gardens, home to giant Elephant Rhubarb Gunnera manicata and American skunk cabbage.  \nThe gazebo to the right of the castle was built by the Admiral to view the incoming ships as they entered Swansea Bay. The gazebo surrounded by a stand of Monterey Pine 'Pinus radiata'. These trees have retained their lower branches which filter the prevailing winds and give greater cover (protection) to the area. A Japanese garden at the top of the gardens holds a red and white painted bridge, many bamboo and an artificial lake with waterfall passing underneath the bridge. The water which rises in Clyne Common, travels under the Japanese Bridge and through the Gardens to join the sea at Blackpill. Alongside the Bridge is a fine specimen of the Handkerchief Tree 'Davidia Involucrata var. vilmoriniana'.\nThe park is scattered with small dogs graves to commemorate the Admiral's family pets. Joy Cottage at the seafront entrance was built as a miniature cottage for the relaxation and education of the Admiral's daughters by nannies employed to teach reading, writing and cookery.\nClyne Chapel built by William Graham Vivian, was opened for worship in 1908. Beneath it, in a private vault, Graham Vivian, his sister Dulcie and the Admiral are buried.\n\n\n== Notable trees ==\nThe tallest recorded Magnolia in Britain 'Magnolia campbellii var. alba' can be found here. The Oak woodland is a remnant of Clyne Forest, an important Norman 11th century historical land feature. Glynn Vivian planted three notable trees still alive in front of the castle - one Wellingtonia 'Sequoiadendron giganteum' and two Monterey Cypress 'Cupressus macrocarpa', one a fastigiate form which is also one of the tallest recorded in Britain.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of gardens in Wales\n\n\n== External links ==\nClyne Gardens (owners` site)\nBBC: Clyne Gardens\nThe garden Landscape Guide: Clyne Gardens\nVisit Wales: Clyne Gardens\nwww.geograph.co.uk : photos of Clyne Gardens",

        "wiki": "Singleton Park (Welsh: Parc Singleton) is the largest urban park in the city of Swansea. It is located in Sketty.\nThe park comprises 250 acres of land. An ornamental garden is located to the south, near the entrance to Swansea University, and a walled botanical garden is located in the centre of the park. On the south-western corner, past the hospital and the university, there is a boating lake with pedalos available, as well as a Crazy Golf course.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park was originally part of the Vivian family estate, which was purchased by Swansea County Borough Council in 1919 for use as a public park.  The park superintendent Daniel Bliss, who was trained at Kew Gardens was responsible for the conception of the Singleton Farm botanical gardens and Ornamental Gardens.  He was also the main driver behind the purchase of the Vivian estate.There is an iconic Swiss cottage located inside the park. This was designed by architect P.F. Robinson, who designed Sketty Hall as well as a number of other lodges in the park. The cottage was badly damaged in 2010 in an arson attack but has now been restored and there are plans to use the space as a cafe.  The lakeside pub, Inn on the Lake, became so well known as The Pub On the Pond that the owner later gave in and changed the name. \nThe park has hosted many entertainment and cultural events such as  Party in the Park and Proms in the Park which were regular events by local stations The Wave & Swansea Sound and other music events held by the two stations and their partners are Escape into the Park and the former Stars in the Park.  The BBC has hosted Proms on the Park and the Biggest Weekend.  Artists who have held concerts in the park include Jess Glynne and the Stereophonics.\nThe Friends of the City of Swansea Botanical Complex have commissioned the creation of a bi-lingual commemorative panel to celebrate the Centenary of Singleton Park being in public ownership. The panel will be displayed in the Botanical Gardens.  This panel will be unveiled by descendants of the Vivian family on Sunday 4 August 2019.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nLocated in the grounds of Singleton Park are:\n\nBishop Gore School\nSwansea University main campus\nSingleton Abbey\nThe Taliesin Arts Centre (which houses a theatre and Ancient Egyptian museum)\nSingleton Hospital\nSketty Hall\nSt. Paul's church with Vivian family  graves\nHeadquarters of 44th Swansea Scout GroupThe Botanical Gardens and FCSBC Plant Sales Shop [Supporting the Botanical Gardens\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of gardens in WalesThe Botanical Gardens\n\n\n== Reference list ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwansea Gov: Singleton Park\nSingleton Park map location and accommodation\n\nComplete listing of all Listed Buildings within The City and County of Swansea.",

        "wiki": "Langland Bay is a popular coastal holiday resort in Gower, Swansea in south  Wales. It is a popular surfing beach which regularly meets the European Blue Flag award for quality.\n\n\n== History ==\nLangland Bay - together with Caswell Bay, Rotherslade, Limeslade Bay, Bracelet Bay and Port Eynon - is managed by the City and County of Swansea council.  Because of their relative proximity to Swansea and the South Wales Valleys, Langland Bay and Caswell Bay in particular were extremely popular in the 1950s and 60s with holiday visitors, who would arrive by coach or by public transport. In summer months the sea front serviced by the South Wales Transport bus route 87; at other times of the year, a walk was necessary from Langland Corner, at the top of Langland Bay Road.\nThe sea front of Langland and the adjacent Rotherslade, or 'Little Langland' as it is sometimes known, were once the location for three hotels: the Langland Bay, the Ael-y-Don, and the Osborne; and three further hotels - the Brynfield Hotel, the Langland Court, and the Wittemberg - were located in the immediate hinterland.  All bar one have closed over the past forty years, and have been replaced with apartments (Langland Bay, Osborne and Ael-y-don), converted to a nursing home (Brynfield), closed and subjected to arson attacks (Langland Court and, previously, the Osborne). The Wittemberg was partially demolished and re-opened in its original Victorian core as the Little Langland Hotel.\nBy far the most dominant building, built in the mid-nineteenth century and backing on to the Newton Cliffs, was originally known as Llan-y-Llan.  Built in the Scottish Baronial style by the Crawshay family, the Merthyr Tydfil Ironmasters, it was used as their summer residence. In the first part of the 20th century it later became part of the Langland Bay Hotel, and later again the Club Union Convalescent Home for coal miners.  After a period of closure it has been renamed Langland Bay Manor and been converted into 13 luxury apartments.\nIn 1897 the French Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley made two watercolours of Langland Bay, while on honeymoon. He was staying at the Osborne Hotel, which overlooked both Langland Bay and Rotherslade Bay. Over twenty paintings resulted from his visit to Penarth and the Gower. Two of them are now in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff.As well as the beach huts that still exist, Langland Bay was famous for its 'community' of green canvas beach tents.  These were erected annually, usually between April and early September, on the stoney storm beach in front of the promenade.  A local spectacle was the early September 'spring tide watch' when rough seas would occasionally cause the loss of one or two. Somewhat safer and more sheltered on the higher ground of the Langland Bay Golf Club, a further two rows of tents were permitted. All succumbed to vandalism in the 1970s.\nLangland Bay has always been the site of sports innovation.  Every year in the early 1960s saw local teenagers becoming amongst the first in the country to take up American innovations such as skateboarding, surfing, and fibreglass canoes; which overtook their parents` use of canvas sea-going canoes.\n\n\n== Access and facilities ==\nA coastal path links Langland Bay to Caswell Bay to the west and to Rotherslade, Limeslade Bay and  Bracelet Bay to the east.  The bay is accessible by road, and is serviced by public transport for a short period during the school summer holidays; there are also two large Pay-&-Display car-parks.  Hot and cold snacks are available from two small shops, though these tend to operate limited opening times during the winter and focus on ice-creams and gifts for children.  Public showers are available near the beach, and a St John's Ambulance Hut and Information Office operate at peak times.\nSwansea City Council operate a Surf Lifeguard service at the beach from the end of May to the beginning of September.\nThe beach hosts 79 Council-owned holiday beach huts, of which the newest, at the western end of the Bay, were built in the early 1860s and the rest in the 1920s. Over the years most had been gradually falling into a sorry state of repair, but in 2007 reconstruction of them all was begun. At the eastern end of the Bay are a number of privately owned beach huts within their own grounds and gated car park.\nAt the western end of the beach promenade is a brasserie, which opened in the summer of 2007.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nSix tennis courts can be hired by the public. These have been the location in recent years for the popular Swansea Junior Tennis Championships supported by Swansea City Council. (In the 1960s the courts hosted a similar tournament but covered a wider age range.)\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nThe course of Langland Bay Golf Club[1] overlooks the bay from the west, and has great views of Langland Bay and Caswell Bay.  The 18-hole course is relatively short, with a standard scratch score of 70. However, the tightness of the course is enough to challenge any golfer, and  unpredictable winds from the exposed headland can often affect the game.\n\n\n=== Surfing ===\nLangland Bay is popular with surfers, as it is conveniently located near residential areas and because of the variety of waves that can be ridden at different tide levels.\nAt low tide, Crab Island provides one of the best-shaped and most powerful right-hand waves in the country; however, many are put off by the fact that the wave breaks onto the exposed reef, so it is considered dangerous for novice surfers. The sandbar situated offshore between Langland Point and Crab Island is actually a reef, which creates a powerful and dangerous wave breaking in shallow water. Langland Point offers a more gentle wave on days when the swell is large.\nAt mid-tide the reef (which is more secluded from the main swell) provides a smaller but crowded wave.\nAt very high tide the shore-break deposits unwary surfers directly onto stones.\nSeveral local surfers have competed on an international level, most notably Carwyn Williams, whose parents ran a small hotel in the resort. Carwyn Williams once beat Australian Damien Hardman, the World champion at the time, in Hossegor, France. Shortly after this he endured a horrific car crash, doctors telling him he would not walk again. He is now living and surfing in France after making a full recovery.\n\n\n=== Fishing ===\nFishing is not commonly practised in Langland these days, either from the beach or from the rocky shore. A strikingly marked large rock on the western side of the bay called Cross Rock used to be a popular spot to fish at high tide in the summer months with float and soft crab as bait. Catches included bass, sea bream and dogfish. Langland Point held similar promise, but the use of spinners or feathers here sometimes delivered mackerel as well as bass. Occasional Common dab and European plaice were caught with lugworm or ragworm from the beach, although the worm population of the beach has always been small.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMumbles Tourist Information Centre\nLive Images of Langland Bay\nSurfing pictures of gower and swansea surfing beaches\nMumbles.co.uk a commercial site providing information about nearby amenities\nLangland Surf Division website with hundreds of photos of surfing on Gower and across South West Wales\nLangland Bay\nLangland Web Cam\nwww.geograph.co.uk : photos of Langland Bay and surrounding area",

          "Of all the beaches we've visited on the Gower for some reason this was the busiest by far. There is parking and a cafe. There are some rocks to explore and its a nice stretch of beach, in hindsight this may have been better to be included in a cliff walk rather than a dedicated",

          "Lovely local (to Swansea) beach, best visited outside of high tide if you can as at high tide the bulk of the beach is pebbles. As the tide retreats it reveals a large sandy and steadily sloping beach that is ideal for kids. During high season the beach is patrolled by",

          "Langland is probably the worst of the beaches in the Mumbles area. My advice would be to visit the nearly Caswell beach or of you have transport visit Pwll Du or Oxwich beaches. It felt a little shabby to be honest.",
          "Very friendly Italian welcome at the cafe/restaurant. Looks expensive initially but actually we ended up sharing and it then turned out to be very good value and plenty. Very popular. This was a Monday lunch and it was full. Clearly it's reputation goes before it. And I suspect",

          "This is a beautiful scene, and we could see it from our rental above the bay. It\u2019s not for swimming\u2014at least not often\u2014because of cool weather, but it\u2019s pretty to gander at. There are some nice restaurants on the shore. For this cornero of Wales, it is a pretty sight.",

          "Plenty of sand on this beach, and also underwater rocks in swathes. When the tide is further out, then around the rocks are little pools and rivulets running to the ocean. These are great for little ones to explore and the water usually gets quite warm. With care you can even go",

        "wiki": "Mumbles (Welsh: Mwmbwls) is a headland sited on the western edge of Swansea Bay on the southern coast of Wales. The name Mumbles is also applied to the district encompassing the electoral wards of Oystermouth, Newton, West Cross, and Mayals. In the 2018 Best Places to Live in the UK report, The Sunday Times listed Mumbles as the best in Wales.\n\n\n== Toponym ==\nMumbles has been noted for its unusual place name. The headland is thought by some to have been named by French sailors, after the shape of the two anthropomorphic islands which comprise the headland: the word \"Mumbles\" may be a corruption of the French les mamelles, meaning \"the breasts.\" Another possible source of the name is from the word Mamucium which is generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brythonic name, either from mamm- (\"breast,\" in reference to a \"breast-like hill\") or from mamma (\"mother,\" in reference to a local river goddess).\nThe Mumbles Lighthouse was built during the 1790s, and was converted to solar powered operation in 1995.\n\n\n== Notable features ==\nThe nearby pier was opened in 1898 at the terminus of the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, which  was the worlds first public passenger train service, opened 2 Mar 1807, horse power to 1877, then steam power and from 1929 double deck overhead electric tram worked from 1929, closed Jan 1960.A lifeboat station has  operated from Mumbles since 1866. In 1947, the entire lifeboat crew was lost at sea, attempting to rescue the crew of the SS Samtampa, in what has become known as the Mumbles lifeboat disaster. The nearest church, All Saints' Church, Oystermouth, contains memorials to the crew.\n\nThe 'Mumbles Mile' is a stretch of road notable for its concentration of pubs. It is a popular destination for students from universities in Swansea and Cardiff for pub crawls and well-known as such in South Wales. Due to a number of pubs closing, it has shrunk over the years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGower Peninsula\nMumbles RFC\nBreast-shaped hill\nSwansea and Mumbles Railway\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMumbles\nMumbles PierMumbles Lifeboat (New link required) \n\nwww.geograph.co.uk Photos of The Mumbles and surrounding area\nVirtual tour of Mumbles Head",

          "Interesting pier with the lifeboat house at the end. It is currently being restored however access is still available and the new flooring looks great! Dog friendly apart from the lifeboat centre. Ice cream and drinks can be purchased in the cafe before the start of the pier",
          "It's nice that access to the pier has recommenced (with the help of a mini-bridge for the last section). There is a very interesting and well-set-out RNLI display at the end of it and the seating section has be tidied. You can also get good views of nesting seabirds on the",
          "It\u2019s a nice pier, with splendid views across Swansea bay. It has a lovely cafe and a decent-sized arcade at the base of the pier and an informative lifeboat station at the top end.

          "Situated along the coast line from Swansea. You could walk it in about an hour or by bike. There are car parks right next to it. Dry picturesque and Victorian looking. The lifeboat house and museum are at the end of the pier and there are little cafes to get great ice cream",
          "Visited for an hour for a bit of fun. A real throwback and very nostalgic- interesting structure and renovation if you\u2019re an engineer like me! Great to see these old piers being renovated and also to see young kids excited by something NOT involving Xbox etc Great ice cream too",

          "Visited here with a party of 10, ordering hot drinks (mixture of coffee, tea, and two hot chocolates). Nine of the drinks came out fairly quick, however one hot chocolate did not have cream as requested. Waited 40 minutes for the other hot choc and cream and marshmellows- when",
          "Good place to go. There are restaurants and gift shops here. All in all quite good. There is a few islands the you can get to at very low tide but you must remember that the tide will come in quite quickly and might cut you off which could be very dangerous",

          "mumbles pier is a very nice place because you have got the amusements you got the beach also you got the lifeboat house in mumbles aswell. But the popular thing about mumbles is its cycling and walking route you can cycle and walk from the marina to mumbles pier via national",
          "I am a regular visitor to the pier and I think it is a great place for all ages. The food and drinks are of a high quality and reasonably priced, and being able to redeem parking charges (up to 2 hours) against your bill is an added bonus. I do find the dog access policy strange",
          "When the sun is shining (not very often I know) we love a walk through the mumbles and onto the pier. Fish and chips followed by a Joe\u2019s ice cream - what more do you need!",
          "We have used the Pier Restaurant a few time now & rather like it. Parking the car for a couple of hours & the Restaurant will deduct the cost from your bill, a nice touch. A good simple Menu including all day Breakfasts as well as traditional Seaside fare. The Breakfasts range",

          "Having lived in Swansea for three years in the 60's I never got as far as the pier even though I spent many a summers evening down in Oystermouth watching the boats. It was worth the walk just to see the new lifeboat house. Unfortunately it wasn't open",
          "Situated a short stroll outside the village of Mumbles itself, the pier projects out into the bay and is home to the new RNLI lifeboat station and its earlier predecessor. There is limited parking close to the pier itself although to walk out to it should be no problem to most",
          "I just want to commend the service to customers here. We regularly go for a cycle to the pier as a family. We recently met up with friends here for food and there was an issue which I have to say was rectified extremely well. Thanks!",
          "I usually frequent the Pier on a weekly basis to meet up with family and friends. The food is first class and they serve a selection of local beers. On a fine day the views across the bay from the restaurant are breathtaking. An added bonus is when you pay \u00a32 for two hours",
          "I used to visit this place at least 5 times a year when I lived in Wales. It never changes and so it shouldn't. I always park as close to the pier as I can and make sure the tide is out so I can get right across the causeway out to the island. They have built a new lifeboat",

          "We walked along the pier to the end, but the sight of it at present it somewhat depressing. At least it is in the process of being restored. The one treat on the pier is the RNLI premises at the far end of the pier. You can visit this during normal opening hours and see the",
          "We always like to walk on piers so couldn't resist going here. A little shocked at the spongy boards covering over all the rotten wood - it didn't fill us with confidence walking over it! The end where the new lifeboat station is situated was great to go in and get close to the",
          "Situated at the far western end of Swansea Bay the pier is a fine example of Victorian workmanship. Under repair at the moment and in a bad way, neglected, worn and rusty. A new lifeboat station has been built on the end, one wonders how it will be reachable if the pier",
          "A lovely little pier to walk down the sea front to visit. Care should be taken as they are doing repairs at the moment but a lovely view from the end.",
          "As in the title enjoy the moment a must is to see the RNLI Station very impressive ,ask your questions as the staff a very helpful .",
          "Not been here for many years. The pier is in the process of being repaired, the far end at the new life boat station looks very impressive, and they are working their way up the pier. We were there on a pleasant evening the sun was shining and the water was calm, with a few",
          "Outstanding views across Swansea Bay. Warm and friendly all-year restaurant. Easy parking. Access to unusual and interesting beach under lighthouse island. Close to Bracelet Bay and free kids play equipment.",
          "Called to Mumbles to have a look at the lifeboat house on the pier as my grandfather was a lifeboatman here and my mother was born here. The pier is quite sad looking and needs a fair bit of renovation, which looks like it is gradually being done. The new lifeboat house is",
          "Visited here, the area is very nice with lovely views, the walk along the pier is a little unnerving as its being renovated and so they have had to lay a walkway over the old wooden floor. The lifeboat at the end of pier is very impressive and very new and modern as is the new",
          "My husband and I took our 3 dogs there for an explore. The pier is undergoing renovation so not much to see of that but the lifeboat centre at the end was worth the walk. Also the view was lovely. We popped into the cafe on the pier and were really pleased to be allowed inside",
          "The mumbles pier is not all perfect, but they are working on it. The new rnli house is great and has wonderful views of the lighthouse.",
          "Although they were doing up the pier when we visited, we had a lovely walk to the end of the pier. The scenery is stunning. The lifeboat station at the end is well documented and you can get a good look at the boat. Volunteers on hand to give good information. Worth the visit.",
          "nice pier and is under repair, what has been done looks fab. at the moment is a temporary walk way down to the life boat station at the end well worth a visit",
          "Went with my 2 year old daughter. Took my daughter to see the RNLI boat which is great. That's about the best thing on the pier. The place is undergoing refurbishment but is expensive and needs a lot of TLC. Decided to stop of in the cafe for a bite to eat. Overpriced and",
          "All the staff were very friendly, great customer service and the food was amazing well visit again soon",
          "The pier itself is very broken down - but it seems repairs have been started. Hopefully by our next visit it will look nicer. However it was nice to go along and see the sea and seagulls",
          "We went there in the the rain, it could be sign posted a little better. The car park is \u00a31 an hour and they do check!!! It was a nice arcade and fun to try and win tickets on the 2p machines. We didn't eat in any of the places but they looked nice from the outside!",
          "The pier is family owned, apart from the RNLI station at the end. Undergoing extensive restoration, the pier is currently narrowed down to a central walkway. However, it is free to go on (when open, and fishermen have to pay \u00a35 for a permit) and the views across to the",
          "Visited the pier during our day in Mumbles. Parked in the Southend car park \u00a35 for the day, 15 minute walk to the pier. There is a lot of renovation work going on so the walkway is narrowed, not very practical when it is busy. Views are stunning though can see across Swansea",
          "Beautiful traditional pier - stunning views across the bay. The only pity was fish and chip shop not open in the evening !",
          "Second time we have visited the Mumbles Pier this year and things have improved in all aspects! Food was very tasty, and staff were polite. Also spent some time in the amusements, great for children. Very busy day so machines were breaking but a staff member Ben Price seemed to",
          "Went for a walk along the pier on quite a windy day just to the the Lifeboat. What a magnificent vessel.",
          "The pier itself was closed for renovation. And it was easy to see why - wooden planks rotted through. The amusement arcade was active but personally cant stand them",
          "Lovely to see so little has changed. The only thing I didn't like was a \u00a35 fee to use the pier for fishing which seems a bit exorbitant.Plenty for the kids and a secret little beach if you know where it is. Currents are dangerous however especially when tide is receding.",
          "Great view of the Swansea bay! Plus I have this passion for lighthouse so as I reached the pier, I stayed for an hour just staring at it. Lovely! The Welsh peeps are so nice as well. I love the countryside!",
          "Ideal for children of any age with the arcade and restaurant. Clean facilities. Easy to park. Will visit again.",
          "We had food in the cafe and went for a nice walk along the pier. Lovely views and locely place. Photo(s) that I uploaded do not do it justice.",
          "We visited with out young son as we regularly do, we felt we wanted to review it as a member of staff called Jay, went out of his way to help and accommodate us. We also noticed him being very kind to other groups with very small children. It's such a busy atmosphere that it's",
          "A lovely little pier with the chance to see the Mumbles Lifeboat. With the cafe, shop and amusements and amazingly cheap parking this is an ideal spot to take the kids. If you park for one hour (\u00a31) or two hours (\u00a32) you can get this refunded in the cafe which means that the",
          "Perfect for going in the Mumbles and to have a rest on Pier with perfect person and sunny day.We coming again for a cold beer.",
          "This pier is still under reconstruction but you can now freely walk to the end of it (to see the Mumbles Lifeboat display), unless you want to fish (in that case it costs \u00a35). The actual pier adjoins a small, pebbled beach at low tide with access to the actual twin Mumbles. It",
          "Lovely, spotless facilities, excellent cafe, pier brilliant and undergoing renovation. Lifeboat shop and boat viewing is amazing.",
          "First time down Mumbles Pier and I had a fantastic time there. Had food in the cafe with my girlfriend, and the service was quick and polite. We spent the rest of the day in the arcade, where we met Ben who was so helpful and friendly. Awesome!",
          "Spent the weekend in Mumbles, beautiful area and great place for small kids, loved the arcades and staff member Ben was extremely friendly and helpful with any enquires we had, hopefully will be visiting again.",
          "I've had such an amazing day out at the Mumbles Pier with my family. We enjoyed our lunch at the cafe and the kids enjoyed their time at the arcade. Also, a member of stuff Ben Price was very helpful when my sister needed help. My family and I are planning on visiting Mumbles",
          "After a walk in the Rain we had a take away Coffee as the life boat went out in the big waves. The boat went out veryyyy fast and i was to late to make a picture\ud83d\ude15 but anyway,its a perfect place to have a walk even on a raining day.",
          "It was nice to see our heritage being preserved by the preservation of this victorian pier. Although not yet complete the whole pier could be accessed and is served by a good alround cafe with indoor & outdoor seating. Other services included take-away - amusements - shop etc.",
          "The pier needs some work to renovate it, but you can still walk down it for free. At the end is the RNLI station where you can visit the lifeboat and the shop which supports the RNLI. There are lovely views over the bay towards Mumbles and across to Port Talbot. Great fish and",
          "I visit mumbles all the time it's a lovely place to take the children or even a day out with friends. There is loads to do around this area. It's very interesting seeing the life boats on the pier. Well worth a visit if you haven't been before.",
          "So lovely to see this Victorian Pier being bought back to life bit by bit! People of Swansea are lucky to have this on their doorstep \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "Very interesting. The pier was very popular. Ice cream good. We were visiting for the day with family. Plenty of parking. There is a good selection of cafes and all at reasonable prices.",
          "Although in need of maintenance a pier well worth visiting with a RNLI Lifeboat station at the end that is open to the public. Can recommend.",
          "While there is still a lot of work needed for the Peir to be back running and fully operational, it was nice to be able to walk on it even it it was just down the middle. The lifeboat station is fantastic and the kids got a kick out of seeing it and learning about it. We",
          "Still being renovated but great to be able to walk to end of it, lovely views of Swansea bay. Sat on the end watching a couple of fishermen catching Dogfish.",
          "they are still working on pier but you can still walk down the centre, the view of the bay of mumbles is great you have the new and old lifeboat centre with loads of seagulls on the old boat centre. worth a walk down.",
          "Mumbles pier has just re-opened to the public and we visited on a lovely hot sunny afternoon (13/08). Quite a crowd visiting the RNLI boat-house and the Tamar class lifeboat is very impressive. Lots of information about the heroic exploits of the lifeboatmen and those who have",
          "Myself and my family visited the mumbles pier last Friday 5/8/16 and we where going to have a breakfast only to be told that they had stopped serving them. We were very gutted. The children decided that they wanted some fish and chips from the chip shop, I was very sceptical as",
          "I went down yesterday as I saw on fb the pair had reopened.. Although it still needs a lot of work we had a fab time to walking to the end again and the children just loved it!! Afterwards we had lunch in the cafe.. Excellent chicken burger and Amazing chips.. Was waited on by a",
          "Our coffee was good , the cafe was as expected on a sunny day very busy Service was prompt ,although we did have to ask more than once for our table to be cleaned",
          "Great views with a small arcade and gift shop. More of a place you stop than a place you spend the day. Lifeboat houses old and new here. Recent work to the area has given it a facelift.",
          "Pleasant enough, but disappointed the pier is shut, which seems poor planning at this time of year. Arcades are fun, but nothing unusual. Small beach nearby, but quite a lot of flies on it. Pleasant stop off on a very rainy day. Not worth the hours drive we made. However, I am",
          "Specially on a nice hot day. You can go fishing. Go arcades. Bike rides. Walks. It's a family area of Swansea. Beautiful down there.",
          "great place to eat very nice food easy parking and an awsun view. After food a nice walk down the pier.",
          "The quirky mini bowling alley above the amusements is lways a big hit with our visitors. Suitable for family groups of all ages from preschool to over nineties, if they can get up the stairs. The cafe is also very good now with simple seaside favourites and friendly service.",
          "Good fun family atmosphere. Only negative is won't allow dogs. A lot of amusements allow dogs. Is off putting for a family member to have to stay outside with the family pet.",
          "We took a trip to mumbles pier today but sadly it was locked up with a notice \"closed for repairs\". This didn't spoil the attraction much because the area is very nice and the amusements were still open if you had children. There is a cafe open at the pier entrance that serves",
          "Our kids climbed the hillock, off of the pier road end, and thought they would take off in the wind. They had a great time.",
          "We continued along Mumbles Road to where there is a relatively large car park, with public toilets and the Castellamare restaurant and caf\u00e9 bar, at Bracelet Bay. A walk back through the car park brings you to steps which lead down to Mumbles pier. Alternatively there is a steep",
          "Beautiful walk around the pier. There was a band playing at the end for the Queen's 90th birthday celebration and the atmosphere was great. There's an arcade for the children (or adults!) and a cafe and a few shops to browse in.",
          "From the car park prices being all in pennies to the old times caf\u00e9, this is a wonderful place to visit. An arcade for the kids and shops for the mums the pier caters to everyone. Be sure to try the milkshakes!",
          "I don't know if the pier is open sometimes or permanently closed for walking but it was closed when we were there.",
          "A nice walk from the village of Mumbles to the Pier. The old one was unsafe but the reconstruction has been good with the new lifeboat station at the end. Spectacular views right back over Swansea Bay and the City. Not much there in the way of facilities, a small bar and the",
          "We walked to The Mumbles Pier from Langland Beach and it was worth the steep walk along the coastal path. Lots of facilities for eating/drinking, an arcade, a small beach. I believe it costs \u00a35 to park all day which is worth it as you can explore other neighbouring bays by",
          "We walked to mumbles pier as we live locally and it was a bank holiday. Our intension was to stop for a coffee until we saw the specials board.it looked very tempting. We had a crab salad and a chicken and mango melt.It was delicious. Well worth the very reasonable price.we will",
          "could not go o the pier but it was a fine sunny day when we visited and it took me back years to my childhood at the seaside. The penny arcade - which is a lot more expensive now lol. very small water area with remote control boats and a water spray game which all kids would",
          "Mumbles pier is a great place to visit especially if you have children. The pier offers fantastic sea views and you are within a short swims distance from the lighthouse where you can see a cross the tower peninsula! The pier has a few small cafe and arcades, be warned the coin",
          "Beautiful place in beautiful surroundings.The food is not fancy but quite tasty.A typical maritime climate.",
          "A spontaneous trip. Parking is five pounds for the whole day. The pier has a cheesy arcade with quite a few games which don't work correctly. The chips were ok, but a bit pricey, and the ketchup is horrid. The views are amazing. We ventured down to the rock pools and had a",
          "We had a quick walk around the pier area. The pier itself is closed for refurbishment work, so there are only a few standard gift shops and an amusement arcade to see. Maybe it was the disappointing weather, but the whole place had a down at heel feel about it.",
          "I went here as a child when I lived in the valleys by the black mountains. Our days out in the summer were Swansea and Mumbles. They are so different .Mumbles is small and friendly.You can take a nice little walk round the beach and above on the rocks. There is a fairground",
          "We visited on a rainy December afternoon, a few others were also doing the same... We did all the sites, the shop etc and ended up slipping 2p's etc into the machines. After about 20 minutes the kids were bored and so we decided to have a go at the upstairs 10 pin bowling!!!",
          "THe breakfast in the cafe was 10/10 recommend alot. The staff were very charming and the view is great. better view than Verdis",
          "Lovely view from the pier with a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The pier itself is a little run down but it adds to the charm. The usual seaside amusement arcade with bar is a feature but filthy toilets unfortunately!",
          "Very interesting Lifeboat centre at the end of the pier where they launch Lifeboats when needed to rescue. Walking to the end of the pier and back gives you a different perspective on how Mumbles looks and a close up view of the lighthouse. Nice for an afternoon stroll.",
          "So disappointed that the actual Pier is still closed, a brisk walk along the Victorian Pier really blows the cob webs away. The children were disappointed that they could not go to see the new lifeboat at the end of the Pier.",
          "If you can catch good weather, this place in Swansea is great for an afternoon stroll and maybe get an icecream afterwards. There's not much activities to do here other than that and maybe getting into a shop or having a cafe while you watch Swansea bay.",
          "Was staying in Mumbles so it would have been rude to to go for a walk along the bay. Extremely windy day (gale force) and got soaked lol. Very picturesque and some nice shops and resturants with the pier at the end",

          "Have been on the Pier many times in the past but it had been closed for refurbishment on several occasions when visiting recently however this time it was open. We went to see the new lifeboat house which is very impressive and we'll worth a look but don't forget to drop a",

          "The new lifeboat station at the end of the dilapidated pier is well worth a visit. An upper viewing platform gives a good view of the lifeboat and the building construction itself is impressive. (a similar construction is underway at the further west St David's station).",
          "Whenever we come down to this area we always walk down to the Pier to go into the Amusement Arcade. We particularly like the Bowling which for \u00a31.50. per person is good value and great fun. The cafe offers good quality food at competitive prices and the shop sells a large",

          "This is an interesting review as its in two parts. The Pier has recently had millions of pounds spent on a new lifeboat station at the end and this is really lovely to walk around and sit and enjoy the views and sea air. You can also fish off the end for \u00a35. The rest of the Pier",

        "wiki": "Oystermouth Castle (Welsh: Castell Ystum Llwynarth) is a Norman stone castle in Wales, overlooking Swansea Bay on the east side of the Gower Peninsula near the village of the Mumbles.\n\n\n== The early castle ==\nThe first castle was founded by William de Londres of Ogmore Castle soon after 1106 following the capture of Gower by the Normans. In 1116 the Welsh of Deheubarth retook the Gower Peninsula and forced William to flee his castle which was put to the torch.  The castle was rebuilt soon afterwards, but was probably destroyed again in 1137 when Gower was once more retaken by the princes of Deheubarth.  The Londres or London family finally died out in 1215 when Gower was again taken by the Welsh under the leadership of Llywelyn the Great.  In 1220 the Welsh were expelled from the peninsula and the government of Henry III of England returned the barony of Gower to John de Braose who rebuilt both Swansea Castle and Oystermouth.\n\n\n== In de Braose hands ==\n\nIn the 13th century the Braose family were Lords of Gower and held the castle as part of their extensive land holdings and titles, including other castles on Gower and in the Welsh Marches. The de Braose dynasty could afford to rebuild Oystermouth castle in stone. A high curtain wall was built, internal buildings added, a chapel, basements, three storey residential buildings with fireplaces and garderobes on each floor. The castle had every residential feature necessary for living in some comfort and was also refortified cleverly. Towards the end of the century Oystermouth rather than Swansea Castle became their principal residence. Edward I paid a brief visit here in December 1284.\nBy 1331 the Lords of Gower were living elsewhere and the castle declined in importance in the 14th century.\nThe daughter of the last de Breos Lord, Aline de Breos, who improved the chapel making it one of the finest in any castle in south Wales, later married John de Mowbray, and the Lordship of Gower including the castle at Oystermouth passed to the de Mowbrays through this marriage, and then to the Herbert family, and finally the Somersets, who became successive Marquis of Worcester and finally Dukes of Beaufort.\n\n\n== Decline and decay ==\nAfter the Middle Ages, the castle gradually fell into ruin. A survey of Gower made in 1650 describes Oystermouth Castle as [a]n old decayed castle of no use, but of a very pleasant situation. It was portrayed in art in the 18th century as a picturesque ruin, and was restored by George Grant Francis in the 1840s while the castle was owned by the then Duke of Beaufort.\nIn 1927 the Duke of Beaufort gave the castle to Swansea Corporation; today, the castle is maintained under the responsibility of the City and County of Swansea council.\n\n\n== 2000s restoration ==\nIn 2009 the National Assembly for Wales announced it was investing \u00a319 million in the country's heritage sites in an attempt to boost tourism. As part of the programme Oystermouth Castle closed in 2010 while it underwent a \u00a31 m refurbishment; it reopened to the public in July the following year.Following the first phase of conservation works Oystermouth Castle reopened to the public in mid July 2011. The scheme includes new visitor facilities, an educational space, improvements to access and a 30-foot high glass viewing platform and bridge that leads to Alina's Chapel.\n\n\n== Notable features of the castle ==\n\nOn either side of the entrance gate the walls curve inward, showing that at one time there were supposed to be two round towers built into the gatehouse. It is unknown whether these were ever built.\nThe chapel (on the second floor of the chapel block) has 14th century traceried windows. According to local tradition the chapel was built under the direction of Aline de Mowbray.\nRemnants of an ornate medieval painting dating back to the 14th century have recently been found in the chapel. The surviving painting is thought to be over 700 years old and was spotted during conservation work in the historic attraction's chapel area. Exposure to the elements has taken its toll on the painting over time but expert Cadw analysis suggests it's a double-arched canopy that contains the figures of angels. Some of the clear elements of the painting that remain include a wing with multiple feathers and circular shapes that form a head with yellow hair surrounded by a nimbus. It's thought the painting is both highly important and testimony to the original design of the chapel attributed to Alina de Breos in the early 14th century that once formed part of a larger work of art.\n\n\n== Namesake ==\nDuring World War II, the Royal Navy operated the naval trawler, HMT Oystermouth Castle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Wales\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nRemfry, P.M., Oystermouth Castle, 1066 to 1326 (ISBN 1-899376-16-X)\nOystermouth Castle \u2013 a tour and short history, published by the Friends of Oystermouth Castle.\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnglo-Norman Castles\nDetails & photos\nwww.geograph.co.uk : photos of Oystermouth Castle\nCastles of Wales \u2013 Oystermouth Castle\ngrid reference SS613883",

          "I only saw the castle walking back to the car from the pier, we decided to check it out. What a great place four pound each for and adult... Well worth it just for the view from the battlements. Great little shop, knowledgable staff, with such a close personal interest in this",
          "Although this Castle has only been available to view as an attraction for a few years, I must say how well and sympathetically they have made access. Most areas are accessible and the views over the town from the ramparts are wonderful. Very reasonably priced and the video gives",
          "Enjoyed spending a couple of hours here. It was fascinating to learn about the history in the video at the start. There are stunning views from the top levels. We were given a sheet with information about each of the rooms/areas, but I would have liked a little more. Take",
          "Before I start this review I just want to say that I'm not a regular reviewer by any means. The castle itself is lovely... however I think we visited on an off day if I am honest. It was extremely hot to be fair. On arrival we saw signs pointing us in the direction of tje",
          "Well worth a visit. we turned up quite late in the day 3.30pm, we were welcomed by staff who gave us a quick run-down & guide sheet & a recommended route around so we could get it all in before they shut at 5pm. Charming place with a chequered history, vantage point good",
          "This stunning castle is really a must if you are in the area, with is much history. Glad it was saved, and now needs to be maintained. Is only a very short walk from the town centre / sea front. Interesting video at the beginning gives a great information. Walking around and",
          "Much bigger than it looks from the outside. Interesting place with lots of history. Possibly not too good for disabled people as walk up very steep. Car parking very limited.",
          "Stopped by to check out some local history and to see the local area. The views from the upper areas were well worth the \u00a34 entrance fee. This castle is not somewhere to spend the whole day, but you can spend a couple of hours here as part of a visit to The Mumbles.",
          "Whilst staying in The Mumbles, we were a stone's throw away from the castle so decided pay a visit. We were met by one of the volunteers, had a brief overview then were shown the best route round. We decided to get a your guide, great for the historical aspect. This place has",
          "I loved climbing in and around this ruin. The glass platform up in the chapel helps you to reach higher levels of the ruin. Do watch the intro video because it gives a good sense of the place. Lots of hidden passages. Very uneven steps and floors- which add to the charm. Some",
          "Met by a lovely gentleman who explained a little about it's history to us and my grandchildren taking time to explain to them .they were very amazed at the history of this place took us about an hour on s lovely day lots of steps to clime so if you are not able bodied it would",
          "This is a great little castle. Lots of history, passages and staircases to explore, lovely views over the bay. Do watch the 10 minute video first, really brings it to life. Which the uninspiring info boards around the castle do not. Come on Swansea council, you could make much",
          "I really enjoyed my hour visit to this stunning castle with so much history, it's also only a short walk from the town centre.",

          "We visited Oystermouth Castle and despite being a rainy day was enjoyable for the modest (\u00a34pp) entrance fee. You can take dogs inside, including up and down the spiral stairs to the ramparts etc. We listened to the 15-20 minute video before exploring, which I'd recommend doing.",
          "The great thing about Welsh castles is their proximity to the shops and main thoroughfares. This one is perfect to get away from the retail therapy and to take in the spectacular structure at close range.",
          "This is a lovely castle, a good size, lots of interest to see. It is nicely kept, was immaculately clean on the day we were there, the grass was cut and well tended and the whole area was litter free. The staff in the shop were very friendly and helpful. It is an easy bus ride",
          "I would really recommend a visit to this beautiful castle and grounds, lovely walk around the castle grounds and if you are lucky the wild garlic will be in full bloom, the smell is just amazing, entry to the castle is \u00a37.50 per adult and \u00a34.50 per child but is well worth it,",
          "A castle kept in a good condition, and one of my absolute favourites that I have ever been to. In the Mumbles, it is easy to access with car parks close to the sea and a quick walk through the town to the castle, of which can be seen from the pier. On a clear day has good",

          "While in the Mumbles area , we came across Oystermouth castle . Did not realise it was not a intact castle but a shell . Still very interesting and gave us a few hours slowly walking around . There is no designated parking that we could find so paid in the sea front PAD car park",
          "Just to let people know that the castle was closed from 1st October to the spring. Wasted journey to Mumbles as the pier is closed also.",
          "Went to the castle but found it was closed for the winter, so be aware if you are travelling from afar. Grounds were well kept and very tidy so spent a little time walking around the outside.",
          "We left Swansea city and drove to Oystermouth Castle as this was in the to do list. Much better and organised than the downtown Swansea Castle ruins. We did pay for the entrance fee which was about GBP10 for 3 adults and were given a map with description of each area we could",
          "We arrived in Mumbles on the Fri of the Aug Bank Hol weekend, knowing the weather wasn't going to be great, so I'd planned on visiting the castle if we needed somewhere to keep our young daughters entertained for a couple of hours. The castle is easy enough to find as you can",
          "Affordable castle to visit. Mostly a ruin that you can walk and also go to upper floors to see. A nice mini room and signs to teach you the history. Great views for artists and photos. Some steps are narrow so be careful if you\u2019ll struggle but plenty to see on the lower",
          "We enjoyed the visit to the castle. Crafts and video story were good. The castle is impressive and looks tough.",
          "I am not very keen on castles generally but gave this one a go as it was near Mumbles pier. Thoroughly enjoyed by my 8 year old. Fair bit to explore and walk around.",
          "Not the biggest of castles, but very interesting with all of the different chambers / rooms & the history behind it. Good views from the walls. Worth checking out.",
          "Visited here with my wife and 4 year old son at the beginning of August. A interesting place to explore with the kids and for any history buff. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Lots of places to explore inside the castle and lots of stairs to climb making it great fun for children as well as adults with vivid imaginations",
          "I went alone, and was pleasantly surprised at how cheap the entrance ticket was! The volunteers were very friendly and helpful, and the short film in the visitors centre was very interesting. Well worth climbing the stairs to the top of the castle for the views over the bay.",

          "This castle is run by volunteers, they were friendly and helpful. The views across Swansea Bay were spectacular. The experience would be improved is there were more boards explaining the ruins. Having said that I though it was good value at \u00a36 for a family ticket. The castle is",

          "To start, this isn't actually IN Swansea, it's closer to Mumbles. Technicality, I know, but don't try to walk to this attraction from Swansea expecting a short walk. The castle itself was small, compared to some of the others we visited. Which is good, in ways, but doesn't",

          "The restoration is not vandalism, it has turned the castle and it's grounds into a lovely place to visit for all ages. Views, as ever, are magnificent and the landscaping and care of the grounds has certainly helped. The glass floor in the main tower is a nice innovation",

          "We went to view a photography exhibition which was worth a look round, but it was what had been done to the castle that I could not belief. If any other private owner had vandalised a building to the extent that CADW have vandalised Oystermouth Castle they would be prosecuted.",
          "We have visited this mostly ruined castle a few times in the past, before the recent restoration. It has always had great views over the bay and Mumbles, but now it also has enough to keep two active children busy exploring for a surprisingly long time! Most parts are now open",
          "A gem of a castle hidden awayfrom the coast in this little village. We did not go in as we were short of time but it looked fascinating. We were able to make out the original motte and bailey structure as we walked around the grounds. The castle is maintained by CADW and there",
          "My experience of visiting this Castle is that it is a ruin and pleasant to walk around with great views over Swansea Bay. My low marking is that you need to have good weather and be prepared to walk up hill not really suitable if you are in a wheel chair or not able to walk",
          "Brought up in Mumbles. Wewere told that there was a whipping post inside the castle.Presently, the castle has been open for the public to visit and has had extensive renovations carried out. The viewpoint from the castle grounds is superb, with views over both The Mumbles and",

          "There is sufficient remaining of the old castle to get a sense of what it would have been like and how confined a place it would have been to live in. The attempts at restoration have been sensitive and to be praised. Staff were informative and helpful. The views from the",

          "The refurbishment has been well done and lots more of the castle is accessible now. Need to get more information boards up so that you know a bit more about what you are looking at. Big cement gate at the roadway is a bit of a strange addition and not sure why this was needed",
          "Still a lot of castle left to see! Beautiful windows still intact, beautiful views to see through them. A fascinating place to go with very helpful and friendly staff. Info per room would be better as the guide only has a basic map with little info on it. The castle history",
          "lovely castle in a great location but a night mare to park especially in the summer months lovely surrounding area",
          "The recent restoration of the castle is a great success. It seems small, but there are little rooms,pathways and lots of archways to wander in and out and roundabout. You can walk along a section of the battlements with great views out to Mumbles head. It's well worth the \u00a32.50",

It has relied on donations, legacies and money raised from activities and commercial operations for income and it has been supported by a Friends group and many volunteers and schools without whom it simply could not manage. Together with its supporters, The Penllergare Trust aims to protect Penllergare Valley Woods and open them to the public as a valuable community asset for the whole of Swansea and beyond.\nDuring World War II, the estate was purchased by the missionary Rees Howells and the mansion was offered as a residence to the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPenllergaer Primary School was built in 1881, and moved to its present site, on Pontardulais Road, in 1976.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nPenllergaer has a Church in Wales church named St David's, and the present Vicar is the Reverend Dr. John Gillibrand (FAB). The church is located on Swansea Road, the vicarage being opposite.\n\n\n== Public services ==\nPenllergaer has a regular bus service to Morriston, Swansea and Gorseinon. Penllergar also has a post Office, one village shop and a park.\n\n\n== Local government ==\nPenllergaer is administered by the City and County of Swansea Council and an elected member for Penllergaer sits on the County Council.\nPenllergaer has its own elected Community Council.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nPenllergaer has its own village rugby and football teams, the football teams play in Camarthenshire League, the 1st team in Division 2 and the reserves in Reserve Division 2.\n\n\n== Neighboring places ==\nThe nearby places are Garden Village, Gorseinon, Fforestfach, Llangyfelach, Grovesend, Pontlliw and Felindre.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Swansea (; Welsh: Abertawe [ab\u025br\u02c8taw\u025b]) is a coastal city and county, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe) in Wales. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of G\u0175yr on the southwest coast. The county area includes Swansea Bay (Welsh: Bae Abertawe) and the Gower Peninsula. Swansea is the second largest city in Wales and the twenty-fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. According to Swansea Council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014, the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. Together with Neath and Port Talbot, Swansea formed a wider Urban Area of 300,352 in 2011.\nDuring the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname Copperopolis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological finds in the Swansea area come mostly from the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans occupied the area.\nThe two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes through the city centre and the Loughor which marks the northern border with Carmarthenshire. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to Mouth of the Tawe. It first appears c.1150 as Aper Tyui.Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its English name may derive from Sveinn's island \u2013 Old Norse: Sveinsey \u2013 the reference to an island may refer either to a bank at the mouth of the River Tawe or to an area of raised ground in marshes. An alternative explanation derives the place name from the Norse personal name Sweyn and ey, which can mean \"inlet\". This explanation supports the tradition that the city was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (reigned in Denmark from 986 to 1014). The name is pronounced Swans-y /\u02c8sw\u0252nzi/), not Swan-sea.The earliest known form of the modern name, Sweynesse, appears in the first charter, granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as Sweyneshe. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.Following the Norman conquest, a marcher lordship was granted by Henry I under the title of Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nFrom the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.\nThe port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed \"Copperopolis\". From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%\u2014the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales\u2014in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from \u00a3112 in 1860 to \u00a335 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.\nThe Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThrough the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.\n\nIn the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz').\nIn 1969 Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.\nIt backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe \"City and County of Swansea\" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.\nThe local government area is 378 square kilometres (146 sq mi) in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering 4,562 acres (1,846 ha) in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status, and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe).Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.\n\n\n=== Welsh Parliament ===\nThe Welsh Parliament constituencies are:\n\nGower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016\nSwansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011\nSwansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011The city is also part of the South Wales West regional constituency and is served by Suzy Davies MS (Conservative), Bethan Jenkins MS (Plaid Cymru), Caroline Jones MS (UKIP) and Dai Lloyd MS (Plaid Cymru).\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK parliamentary constituencies in Swansea are:\n\nGower, current MP is Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour since 2017\nSwansea East, current MP is, Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2015\nSwansea West, current MP is Geraint Davies, Labour since 2010\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSwansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula to the west was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.\nThe most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast\u2014the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.\nThe geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to 185 metres (607 ft) range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to 193 metres (633 ft) high. The highest point is located Penlle'r Castell at 374 metres (1,227 ft) on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate. As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic. In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrom 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. \nAround 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.The wider urban area, including most of Swansea Bay, has a total population of 300,352, making it the third largest urban area in Wales and the 27th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are Asian \u2013 mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.\nThe Office for National Statistics 2010 mid-year population estimate for the City & County of Swansea is 232,500.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nThe Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.\nFluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.\nIn 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at \u00a318 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSwansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.\n\n\n=== Welsh language ===\nThere are many Welsh language chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward Mawr are able to speak Welsh, as can 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nLocal produce includes cockles and laverbread sourced from the Loughor estuary. Salt marsh lamb, raised in the salt marshes of the estuary, is also a local speciality.\n\n\n=== Listed buildings ===\n\nThe city has three Grade One listed buildings: Swansea Castle, the Tabernacle Chapel, Morriston and the Swansea Guildhall. Swansea Castle was an impressive building occupying a strategic position above the River Tawe. The ruins that are visible today date from the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the \"Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales\" and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is \"the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered\". The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered \"the most important building in Wales of its period\".\n\nIn addition to these there are a number of Grade II* listed buildings; Ebenezer Baptist Chapel and its Hall in Ebenezer Street; the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery; the Midland Bank building; the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Kingsway, along with its Hall and School blocks; the Offices of Associated British Ports in Pier Street; the Royal Institution of South Wales building, now Swansea Museum in Victoria Road; and the Old Guildhall in Somerset Place.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nThe poet Dylan Thomas is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; his take on Swansea was that it was an \"ugly lovely town\". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Caf\u00e9 which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city. Their wealth and influence came from large copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector Dynevor School, Swansea before reading theology at Christ's College, Cambridge. Catherine Zeta-Jones was born and raised in Swansea and still owns a home in Mumbles. Swansea is also the home town of 2013 ITU Triathlon World Champion Non Stanford. The thriller writer, Mark Ellis was educated in Swansea.\nPeople from Swansea are known locally as Swansea Jacks, or just Jacks. The source of this nickname is not clear. Some attribute it to Swansea Jack, the life-saving dog.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nSwansea City A.F.C. (founded 1912) is the city's main football association team. Originally playing at the Vetch Field, they moved to the Liberty Stadium at the start of the 2005\u20132006 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the English Championship, after spending seven seasons in the English Premier League. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium.\nSwansea has four association football clubs that play in the Welsh football league system: Swansea University F.C., Garden Village, South Gower and West End.\n\nSwansea is home to Swansea Rugby Football Club (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh rugby union. Playing out of St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including Billy Bancroft and Billy Trew, they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.\nIn 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Ospreys. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.\nSt Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there. In this ground, Sir Garfield Sobers hit six sixes in one over; the first time this was achieved in a game of first-class cricket. The final ball landed on the ground past the Cricketers' pub just outside the ground. It is also the home of the tallest floodlight stand in Europe.Swansea's rugby league side plays 13 miles (21 km) from Swansea in the small town of Ystalyfera. They are known as the Swansea Valley Miners but were formed as the Swansea Bulls in 2002.\nThe Swansea Bowls Stadium opened in early 2008. The stadium hosted the World Indoor Singles and Mixed Pairs Championship in April 2008 and the Gravelles Welsh International Open Bowls Championships in 2009.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nIn 2001, 158,457 people in the local authority area (71 per cent) stated their religion to be Christian, 44,286 (20 per cent) no religion, 16,800 (7.5 per cent) did not state a religion and 2,167 were Muslim. There are small communities of other religions, each making up a little under 1 per cent of the total population.Swansea is part of the Anglican Diocese of Swansea and Brecon and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia. The Catholic see is based in Swansea at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Greenhill area.\n\nSwansea, like Wales in general, has seen many Non-conformist religious revivals. In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.\nThe Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church. The church has an organ by Harrison & Harrison.\n\nThe Norwegian Church is a Grade II listed building in the docklands area of the city. The church building was originally located at Newport Docks. The building consists of a Seaman's Mission to the west end and a single gothic church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship for Norwegian sailors when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket on the River Tawe.\nThe city is home to 10% of the total Welsh Muslim population; Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new central mosque and community centre in the former St. Andrew's United Reformed Church. This would replace the existing central Mosque on St Helens Road and be in addition to the other three existing mosques (Swansea University Mosque, Hafod Mosque, Imam Khoei Mosque).Swansea is represented in Buddhism with the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Pulpung Changchub Dargyeling (Kagyu Tradition) and a branch of the international Dzogchen Community (Nyingma Tradition). Swansea Synagogue and Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall are both located in the Uplands area. Around 160 people in Swansea indicated they were Jewish in the 2011 census.\n\n\n== Plans ==\nSwansea City Centre is undergoing a \u00a31 billion transformation scheme. A large area of the city is earmarked for redevelopment. A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated St. David's Shopping Centre which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city's Sainsbury's store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans \u2013 Castle Street development. New green spaces will be provided in conjunction with the proposed Quadrant Square and Grand Theatre Square. Redevelopment of the Oxford Street car park and Lower Oxford Street arcades are also planned.At the sea front, The Tower, Meridian Quay is now Wales's tallest building at a height of 107 metres (351 ft) with a restaurant on the top (29th) floor. It was under construction adjacent Swansea Marina until 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSwansea originally developed as centre for metals and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in public administration, education & health and banking, finance & insurance, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average. In 2005, GVA per head in Swansea was \u00a314,302 \u2013 nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average. Median full-time earnings in Swansea were \u00a321,577 in 2007, almost identical to the Welsh average.Swansea is home to the DVLA headquarters in Morriston, which employs around 6,000 people in the city. Other major employers in the city are Admiral Group, HSBC, Virgin Media, Swansea Bay University Health Board, BT and Amazon.co.uk. Virgin Atlantic also maintains its largest worldwide contact centre in Swansea; including reservations, sales, baggage claims, and customer relations.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Further and higher education ===\nSwansea University has a campus in Singleton Park overlooking Swansea Bay. Its engineering department is recognised as a centre of excellence with pioneering work on computational techniques for solving engineering design problems. The department of physics is renowned for its research achievements at the frontiers of theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of elementary particle physics and string theory. Many other departments including history, computer science and German have been awarded an \"Excellent\" inspection ratings. In 2015 Swansea University opened a new Bay Campus situated in the Jersey Marine area of Swansea. The university was awarded The Times Higher Education Supplement Award for the UK's \"best student experience\" in 2005. In 2017, Swansea University Medical School was ranked as the third best medical school in the United Kingdom, behind Oxford and Cambridge universities.\nOther establishments for further and higher education in the city include University of Wales Trinity Saint David and Gower College Swansea. Trinity Saint David was formed on 18 November 2010 through the merger of University of Wales Lampeter and Trinity University college Carmarthen under Lampeter's royal charter of 1828. On 1 August 2013, Swansea Metropolitan University became part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD). Swansea Metropolitan University was particularly well known for its Architectural Glass department, as well as its Teaching and Transport & Logistics degrees. Trinity Saint David also took over the Swansea Business School, which was formerly part of the Metropolitan University.

        "wiki": "Swansea (; Welsh: Abertawe [ab\u025br\u02c8taw\u025b]) is a coastal city and county, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe) in Wales. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of G\u0175yr on the southwest coast. The county area includes Swansea Bay (Welsh: Bae Abertawe) and the Gower Peninsula. Swansea is the second largest city in Wales and the twenty-fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. According to Swansea Council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014, the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. Together with Neath and Port Talbot, Swansea formed a wider Urban Area of 300,352 in 2011.\nDuring the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname Copperopolis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological finds in the Swansea area come mostly from the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans occupied the area.\nThe two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes through the city centre and the Loughor which marks the northern border with Carmarthenshire. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to Mouth of the Tawe. It first appears c.1150 as Aper Tyui.Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its English name may derive from Sveinn's island \u2013 Old Norse: Sveinsey \u2013 the reference to an island may refer either to a bank at the mouth of the River Tawe or to an area of raised ground in marshes. An alternative explanation derives the place name from the Norse personal name Sweyn and ey, which can mean \"inlet\". This explanation supports the tradition that the city was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (reigned in Denmark from 986 to 1014). The name is pronounced Swans-y /\u02c8sw\u0252nzi/), not Swan-sea.The earliest known form of the modern name, Sweynesse, appears in the first charter, granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as Sweyneshe. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.Following the Norman conquest, a marcher lordship was granted by Henry I under the title of Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nFrom the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.\nThe port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed \"Copperopolis\". From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%\u2014the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales\u2014in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from \u00a3112 in 1860 to \u00a335 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.\nThe Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThrough the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.\n\nIn the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz').\nIn 1969 Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.\nIt backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe \"City and County of Swansea\" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.\nThe local government area is 378 square kilometres (146 sq mi) in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering 4,562 acres (1,846 ha) in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status, and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe).Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.\n\n\n=== Welsh Parliament ===\nThe Welsh Parliament constituencies are:\n\nGower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016\nSwansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011\nSwansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011The city is also part of the South Wales West regional constituency and is served by Suzy Davies MS (Conservative), Bethan Jenkins MS (Plaid Cymru), Caroline Jones MS (UKIP) and Dai Lloyd MS (Plaid Cymru).\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK parliamentary constituencies in Swansea are:\n\nGower, current MP is Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour since 2017\nSwansea East, current MP is, Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2015\nSwansea West, current MP is Geraint Davies, Labour since 2010\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSwansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula to the west was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.\nThe most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast\u2014the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.\nThe geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to 185 metres (607 ft) range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to 193 metres (633 ft) high. The highest point is located Penlle'r Castell at 374 metres (1,227 ft) on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate. As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic. In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrom 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. \nAround 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.The wider urban area, including most of Swansea Bay, has a total population of 300,352, making it the third largest urban area in Wales and the 27th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are Asian \u2013 mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.\nThe Office for National Statistics 2010 mid-year population estimate for the City & County of Swansea is 232,500.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nThe Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.\nFluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.\nIn 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at \u00a318 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSwansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.\n\n\n=== Welsh language ===\nThere are many Welsh language chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward Mawr are able to speak Welsh, as can 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nLocal produce includes cockles and laverbread sourced from the Loughor estuary. Salt marsh lamb, raised in the salt marshes of the estuary, is also a local speciality.\n\n\n=== Listed buildings ===\n\nThe city has three Grade One listed buildings: Swansea Castle, the Tabernacle Chapel, Morriston and the Swansea Guildhall. Swansea Castle was an impressive building occupying a strategic position above the River Tawe. The ruins that are visible today date from the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the \"Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales\" and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is \"the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered\". The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered \"the most important building in Wales of its period\".\n\nIn addition to these there are a number of Grade II* listed buildings; Ebenezer Baptist Chapel and its Hall in Ebenezer Street; the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery; the Midland Bank building; the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Kingsway, along with its Hall and School blocks; the Offices of Associated British Ports in Pier Street; the Royal Institution of South Wales building, now Swansea Museum in Victoria Road; and the Old Guildhall in Somerset Place.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nThe poet Dylan Thomas is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; his take on Swansea was that it was an \"ugly lovely town\". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Caf\u00e9 which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city. Their wealth and influence came from large copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector Dynevor School, Swansea before reading theology at Christ's College, Cambridge. Catherine Zeta-Jones was born and raised in Swansea and still owns a home in Mumbles. Swansea is also the home town of 2013 ITU Triathlon World Champion Non Stanford. The thriller writer, Mark Ellis was educated in Swansea.\nPeople from Swansea are known locally as Swansea Jacks, or just Jacks. The source of this nickname is not clear. Some attribute it to Swansea Jack, the life-saving dog.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nSwansea City A.F.C. (founded 1912) is the city's main football association team. Originally playing at the Vetch Field, they moved to the Liberty Stadium at the start of the 2005\u20132006 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the English Championship, after spending seven seasons in the English Premier League. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium.\nSwansea has four association football clubs that play in the Welsh football league system: Swansea University F.C., Garden Village, South Gower and West End.\n\nSwansea is home to Swansea Rugby Football Club (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh rugby union. Playing out of St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including Billy Bancroft and Billy Trew, they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.\nIn 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Ospreys. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.\nSt Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there. In this ground, Sir Garfield Sobers hit six sixes in one over; the first time this was achieved in a game of first-class cricket. The final ball landed on the ground past the Cricketers' pub just outside the ground. It is also the home of the tallest floodlight stand in Europe.Swansea's rugby league side plays 13 miles (21 km) from Swansea in the small town of Ystalyfera. They are known as the Swansea Valley Miners but were formed as the Swansea Bulls in 2002.\nThe Swansea Bowls Stadium opened in early 2008. The stadium hosted the World Indoor Singles and Mixed Pairs Championship in April 2008 and the Gravelles Welsh International Open Bowls Championships in 2009.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nIn 2001, 158,457 people in the local authority area (71 per cent) stated their religion to be Christian, 44,286 (20 per cent) no religion, 16,800 (7.5 per cent) did not state a religion and 2,167 were Muslim. There are small communities of other religions, each making up a little under 1 per cent of the total population.Swansea is part of the Anglican Diocese of Swansea and Brecon and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia. The Catholic see is based in Swansea at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Greenhill area.\n\nSwansea, like Wales in general, has seen many Non-conformist religious revivals. In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.\nThe Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church. The church has an organ by Harrison & Harrison.\n\nThe Norwegian Church is a Grade II listed building in the docklands area of the city. The church building was originally located at Newport Docks. The building consists of a Seaman's Mission to the west end and a single gothic church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship for Norwegian sailors when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket on the River Tawe.\nThe city is home to 10% of the total Welsh Muslim population; Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new central mosque and community centre in the former St. Andrew's United Reformed Church. This would replace the existing central Mosque on St Helens Road and be in addition to the other three existing mosques (Swansea University Mosque, Hafod Mosque, Imam Khoei Mosque).Swansea is represented in Buddhism with the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Pulpung Changchub Dargyeling (Kagyu Tradition) and a branch of the international Dzogchen Community (Nyingma Tradition). Swansea Synagogue and Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall are both located in the Uplands area. Around 160 people in Swansea indicated they were Jewish in the 2011 census.\n\n\n== Plans ==\nSwansea City Centre is undergoing a \u00a31 billion transformation scheme. A large area of the city is earmarked for redevelopment. A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated St. David's Shopping Centre which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city's Sainsbury's store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans \u2013 Castle Street development. New green spaces will be provided in conjunction with the proposed Quadrant Square and Grand Theatre Square. Redevelopment of the Oxford Street car park and Lower Oxford Street arcades are also planned.At the sea front, The Tower, Meridian Quay is now Wales's tallest building at a height of 107 metres (351 ft) with a restaurant on the top (29th) floor. It was under construction adjacent Swansea Marina until 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSwansea originally developed as centre for metals and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in public administration, education & health and banking, finance & insurance, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average. In 2005, GVA per head in Swansea was \u00a314,302 \u2013 nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average. Median full-time earnings in Swansea were \u00a321,577 in 2007, almost identical to the Welsh average.Swansea is home to the DVLA headquarters in Morriston, which employs around 6,000 people in the city. Other major employers in the city are Admiral Group, HSBC, Virgin Media, Swansea Bay University Health Board, BT and Amazon.co.uk.

        "wiki": "Cwmdonkin Park is an urban park situated in the Uplands area of Swansea, Wales. The park has a bandstand, children's play area, water gardens, tennis courts, and a bowling green.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe use of the land for public recreation originated with the creation of Cwmdonkin reservoir around 1850 by William Henry Smith and the Swansea Waterworks Company. The records of the Borough of Swansea and the Cambrian newspaper detail the somewhat controversial use of public funds to take over and run \"the destructive pit at Cwmdonkin, euphemistically called a reservoir\".The first suggestion to landscape the grounds around the reservoir was raised in 1853 but it was not until 1874 that Swansea Council purchased two fields from Mr James Walters for \u00a34,650 to create the park which was opened on 24 July 1874. There was some criticism that the park was in an essentially wealthy, middle-class area of town: this led to the emergence of the \"Open Spaces Movement\" led by William Thomas of Lan, which campaigned for more parks for deprived working class areas.Cwmdonkin Reservoir was filled in with rubble in the 1950s and landscaped to become a children\u2019s play area.\n\n\n== Dylan Thomas ==\n\nPoet Dylan Thomas grew up near the park at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive.\nThe park features heavily in the radio broadcasts, Return Journey and Reminiscences of Childhood, and the poem, The Hunchback in the Park. A memorial stone with lines from Fern Hill was placed in the park in 1963.\n\n\n== Refurbishment ==\nOn 7 September 2013, after an extensive \u00a31.39m refurbishment, the park reopened in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Dylan Thomas's birth.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The remains of the Hafod-Morfa Copperworks, originally developed by Vivian & Sons, consists of a core Grade II listed building and additional Grade II listed structures on a 12 acres (4.9 ha) site, on the banks of the River Tawe in Hafod, Swansea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hafod works was founded in 1810 by the Cornishman John Vivian. During the 19th century, this was the largest copper works in the world, employing over 1,000 people. The rival Morfa works was established in 1835 by Williams, Foster & Co., and the two adjacent sites combined in 1924 under Yorkshire Imperial Metals.\nSwansea was core to the global copper industry, and by 1823 10,000 of Swansea\u2019s 15,000 residents were supported by the copper industry. By 1883 there were 124 works including 12 copper works in the Lower Swansea Valley. But as raw geological resources had waned in South Wales, it became more economic to produce copper elsewhere. In 1971 the Lower Swansea Valley Project had started to transform the most derelict industrial landscape in Britain, resulting in the closure of the rolling mills in 1980.The former rolling mills were converted into the Landore Collection Centre, part of Swansea Museum.\n\n\n== Reclamation and regeneration ==\nIn 2010, the local authority discussed plans to have the site re-developed where the listed buildings would be preserved and new uses would be given to heritage buildings. The 2010 development plan included a new hotel, restaurant and new housing.In 2011, the local council named Swansea University as a development partner of the site, who are evaluating the possibility of developing academic facilities at the site.  Public grants of \u00a3540,000 were awarded for the preservation and renewal of the site. Stage1 commenced in October 2013, clearing overgrown vegetation and undertaking essential preservation works.In 2019, plans to re-develop the site into a distillery and visitors' centre for the Penderyn brand were approved, with construction due to begin at the end of 2019, and the centre to open in 2022. The project was part-funded by a \u00a33.75m National Lottery Heritage Fund grant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hafod Copperworks at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Hafod-Morfa Copperworks website\nThe Hafod/Morfa Copperworks regeneration project\nPhotos of Hafod and surrounding area on geograph.org.uk\nSwansea Council - A Short History of the Hafod Copperworks\nWales Online - Time Team\u2019s discoveries to boost revamp of Swansea\u2019s historic copperworks\nThis is South Wales - Team digs up city's hidden copper history\nBBC News - Swansea University chosen as Hafod copper site partner\nBBC News - Call to save Swansea's Hafod copperworks site\nSwansea University - A World of Welsh Copper\nVideo of Hafod-Morfa Copperworks from 2016",

        "wiki": "Swansea (; Welsh: Abertawe [ab\u025br\u02c8taw\u025b]) is a coastal city and county, officially known as the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe) in Wales. Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan and the ancient Welsh commote of G\u0175yr on the southwest coast. The county area includes Swansea Bay (Welsh: Bae Abertawe) and the Gower Peninsula. Swansea is the second largest city in Wales and the twenty-fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. According to Swansea Council, the City and County of Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014, the second most populous local authority area in Wales after Cardiff. Together with Neath and Port Talbot, Swansea formed a wider Urban Area of 300,352 in 2011.\nDuring the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the copper-smelting industry, earning the nickname Copperopolis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological finds in the Swansea area come mostly from the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans occupied the area.\nThe two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes through the city centre and the Loughor which marks the northern border with Carmarthenshire. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to Mouth of the Tawe. It first appears c.1150 as Aper Tyui.Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its English name may derive from Sveinn's island \u2013 Old Norse: Sveinsey \u2013 the reference to an island may refer either to a bank at the mouth of the River Tawe or to an area of raised ground in marshes. An alternative explanation derives the place name from the Norse personal name Sweyn and ey, which can mean \"inlet\". This explanation supports the tradition that the city was founded by King Sweyn Forkbeard (reigned in Denmark from 986 to 1014). The name is pronounced Swans-y /\u02c8sw\u0252nzi/), not Swan-sea.The earliest known form of the modern name, Sweynesse, appears in the first charter, granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick. The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen (called burgesses) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 King John granted a second charter, in which the name appears as Sweyneshe. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.Following the Norman conquest, a marcher lordship was granted by Henry I under the title of Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nFrom the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading copper-smelting area. Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.\nThe port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. After the invention of the reverbatory furnace in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more. Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More coal mines opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced tinplate and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed \"Copperopolis\". From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%\u2014the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales\u2014in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from \u00a3112 in 1860 to \u00a335 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.\nThe Swansea and Mumbles Railway was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the Clyne valley to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThrough the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.\n\nIn the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the Swansea Blitz on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz').\nIn 1969 Swansea was granted city status to mark Prince Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. The Prince made the announcement on 3 July 1969 during a tour of Wales. Swansea obtained the further right to have a Lord Mayor in 1982.Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.\nIt backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre, which opened in 1978, and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe \"City and County of Swansea\" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. The Urban Subdivision of Swansea covers all urbanised areas within the city boundary, with a population of 179,485, it is considerably smaller than the unitary authority.\nThe local government area is 378 square kilometres (146 sq mi) in size, about 2% of the area of Wales. It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering 4,562 acres (1,846 ha) in the county of Glamorgan. There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status, and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974. In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' (Welsh: Dinas a Sir Abertawe).Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years. The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control. For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.\n\n\n=== Welsh Parliament ===\nThe Welsh Parliament constituencies are:\n\nGower, current MS is Rebecca Evans, Labour since 2016\nSwansea East, current MS is Mike Hedges, Labour since 2011\nSwansea West, current MS is Julie James, Labour since 2011The city is also part of the South Wales West regional constituency and is served by Suzy Davies MS (Conservative), Bethan Jenkins MS (Plaid Cymru), Caroline Jones MS (UKIP) and Dai Lloyd MS (Plaid Cymru).\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK parliamentary constituencies in Swansea are:\n\nGower, current MP is Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour since 2017\nSwansea East, current MP is, Carolyn Harris, Labour since 2015\nSwansea West, current MP is Geraint Davies, Labour since 2010\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSwansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula to the west was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB. Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands. The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain range. To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.\nThe most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill and Mayhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast\u2014the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.\nThe geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr. Areas up to 185 metres (607 ft) range across the central section: Kilvey Hill, Townhill and Llwynmawr separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill are up to 193 metres (633 ft) high. The highest point is located Penlle'r Castell at 374 metres (1,227 ft) on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTypical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate. As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic. In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrom 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the 21st century, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007. \nAround 82% of the population were born in Wales and 13% born in England; 13.4% were Welsh speakers.The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700. The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais. In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.The wider urban area, including most of Swansea Bay, has a total population of 300,352, making it the third largest urban area in Wales and the 27th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are Asian \u2013 mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.\nThe Office for National Statistics 2010 mid-year population estimate for the City & County of Swansea is 232,500.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nThe Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.\nFluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. A folk festival is held on Gower. Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.Swansea is home to the Palace Theatre. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.\nIn 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at \u00a318 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSwansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.\n\n\n=== Welsh language ===\nThere are many Welsh language chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward Mawr are able to speak Welsh, as can 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nLocal produce includes cockles and laverbread sourced from the Loughor estuary. Salt marsh lamb, raised in the salt marshes of the estuary, is also a local speciality.\n\n\n=== Listed buildings ===\n\nThe city has three Grade One listed buildings: Swansea Castle, the Tabernacle Chapel, Morriston and the Swansea Guildhall. Swansea Castle was an impressive building occupying a strategic position above the River Tawe. The ruins that are visible today date from the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Today, the castle is hemmed in by modern buildings. The Tabernacle Chapel at Morriston was built in 1872 by John Humphreys of Swansea. A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the \"Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales\" and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is \"the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered\". The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by Percy Thomas and opened in 1934. It is faced in white Portland stone and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the Brangwyn Hall concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered \"the most important building in Wales of its period\".\n\nIn addition to these there are a number of Grade II* listed buildings; Ebenezer Baptist Chapel and its Hall in Ebenezer Street; the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery; the Midland Bank building; the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Kingsway, along with its Hall and School blocks; the Offices of Associated British Ports in Pier Street; the Royal Institution of South Wales building, now Swansea Museum in Victoria Road; and the Old Guildhall in Somerset Place.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nThe poet Dylan Thomas is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby Cwmdonkin Park; his take on Swansea was that it was an \"ugly lovely town\". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Caf\u00e9 which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.Throughout the 19th century, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city. Their wealth and influence came from large copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), and is still visible today in their former family residences: Singleton Abbey (now used by Swansea University), Sketty Hall, Clyne Castle and Clyne Gardens. Henry Vivian became the first Lord Swansea in 1893.\nRowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector Dynevor School, Swansea before reading theology at Christ's College, Cambridge. Catherine Zeta-Jones was born and raised in Swansea and still owns a home in Mumbles. Swansea is also the home town of 2013 ITU Triathlon World Champion Non Stanford. The thriller writer, Mark Ellis was educated in Swansea.\nPeople from Swansea are known locally as Swansea Jacks, or just Jacks. The source of this nickname is not clear. Some attribute it to Swansea Jack, the life-saving dog.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nSwansea City A.F.C. (founded 1912) is the city's main football association team. Originally playing at the Vetch Field, they moved to the Liberty Stadium at the start of the 2005\u20132006 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the English Championship, after spending seven seasons in the English Premier League. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium.\nSwansea has four association football clubs that play in the Welsh football league system: Swansea University F.C., Garden Village, South Gower and West End.\n\nSwansea is home to Swansea Rugby Football Club (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh rugby union. Playing out of St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including Billy Bancroft and Billy Trew, they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the All Blacks.\nIn 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Ospreys. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.\nSt Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there. In this ground, Sir Garfield Sobers hit six sixes in one over; the first time this was achieved in a game of first-class cricket. The final ball landed on the ground past the Cricketers' pub just outside the ground. It is also the home of the tallest floodlight stand in Europe.Swansea's rugby league side plays 13 miles (21 km) from Swansea in the small town of Ystalyfera. They are known as the Swansea Valley Miners but were formed as the Swansea Bulls in 2002.\nThe Swansea Bowls Stadium opened in early 2008. The stadium hosted the World Indoor Singles and Mixed Pairs Championship in April 2008 and the Gravelles Welsh International Open Bowls Championships in 2009.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nIn 2001, 158,457 people in the local authority area (71 per cent) stated their religion to be Christian, 44,286 (20 per cent) no religion, 16,800 (7.5 per cent) did not state a religion and 2,167 were Muslim. There are small communities of other religions, each making up a little under 1 per cent of the total population.Swansea is part of the Anglican Diocese of Swansea and Brecon and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia. The Catholic see is based in Swansea at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Greenhill area.\n\nSwansea, like Wales in general, has seen many Non-conformist religious revivals. In 1904, Evan Roberts, a miner from Loughor (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest Protestant religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit.\nThe Ebenezer Baptist Church dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church. The church has an organ by Harrison & Harrison.\n\nThe Norwegian Church is a Grade II listed building in the docklands area of the city. The church building was originally located at Newport Docks. The building consists of a Seaman's Mission to the west end and a single gothic church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship for Norwegian sailors when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket on the River Tawe.\nThe city is home to 10% of the total Welsh Muslim population; Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new central mosque and community centre in the former St. Andrew's United Reformed Church. This would replace the existing central Mosque on St Helens Road and be in addition to the other three existing mosques (Swansea University Mosque, Hafod Mosque, Imam Khoei Mosque).Swansea is represented in Buddhism with the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre, Pulpung Changchub Dargyeling (Kagyu Tradition) and a branch of the international Dzogchen Community (Nyingma Tradition). Swansea Synagogue and Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall are both located in the Uplands area. Around 160 people in Swansea indicated they were Jewish in the 2011 census.\n\n\n== Plans ==\nSwansea City Centre is undergoing a \u00a31 billion transformation scheme. A large area of the city is earmarked for redevelopment. A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated St. David's Shopping Centre which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the Quadrant Shopping Centre. Including relocation of the Tesco Superstore near to the city's Sainsbury's store in Parc Tawe, the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans \u2013 Castle Street development. New green spaces will be provided in conjunction with the proposed Quadrant Square and Grand Theatre Square. Redevelopment of the Oxford Street car park and Lower Oxford Street arcades are also planned.At the sea front, The Tower, Meridian Quay is now Wales's tallest building at a height of 107 metres (351 ft) with a restaurant on the top (29th) floor. It was under construction adjacent Swansea Marina until 2010.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSwansea originally developed as centre for metals and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the Lower Swansea valley. However, by the end of the Second World War these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a post-industrial, service sector economy.Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in public administration, education & health and banking, finance & insurance, and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average. In 2005, GVA per head in Swansea was \u00a314,302 \u2013 nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average. Median full-time earnings in Swansea were \u00a321,577 in 2007, almost identical to the Welsh average.Swansea is home to the DVLA headquarters in Morriston, which employs around 6,000 people in the city.

The south coast of Gower is the chief magnet for walkers, with a path stretching from Mumbles Head across the cliff tops, beaches and coastal woodland to Rhossili.\n\nOn the Waterfront, Swansea Bay has a five-mile (8 km) sweep of coastline which features a beach, promenade, children's lido, leisure pool, marina and maritime quarter featuring the museums the National Waterfront Museum and Swansea Museum, the oldest museum in Wales. Also situated in the maritime quarter is the Dylan Thomas Centre, which celebrates the life and work of the author with its permanent exhibition 'Dylan Thomas \u2013 Man and Myth', and Mission Gallery, a unique art gallery also in the heart of the Maritime Quarter which hosts a range of exhibitions from various art disciplines; it also host a craft space, with ranging works from local and international artists. The Dylan Thomas Centre is the focal point for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival (27 October \u2013 9 November). There is a permanent exhibition at the Dylan Thomas Birthplace and Home for 23 years in Uplands which has been restored to its condition as a new house when bought by the Thomas family in 1914 a few months before Dylan was born in the front bedroom. The SA1 Waterfront area is the latest development for living, dining and leisure.\n\nSwansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower are home to various parks and gardens and almost 20 nature reserves. Clyne Gardens is home to a collection of plants set in parkland and host to 'Clyne in Bloom' in May. Singleton Park has acres of parkland, a botanical garden, a boating lake with pedal boats, and crazy golf. Plantasia is a tropical hothouse pyramid featuring three climatic zones, housing a variety of unusual plants, including several species which are extinct in the wild, and monkeys, reptiles, fish and a butterfly house. Other parks include Cwmdonkin Park, where Dylan Thomas played as a child, and Victoria Park which is close to the promenade on the seafront.Oxwich Bay on the Gower Peninsula was named the most beautiful beach in Britain by travel writers who visited more than 1,000 beaches around the world in search of the perfect sands (2007). The Travel Magazine praised Oxwich for \"magnificent and unspoilt\" scenery and as a \"great place for adults and children to explore\". It has over three miles (5 km) of sand and The Guardian named it one of Britain's blue-riband top 10 category beaches (2007). The Independent newspaper hailed Rhossili Bay as \"the British supermodel of beaches\" (2006) and the best beach in Britain for breathtaking cliffs (2007), whilst The Sunday Times listed it as one of the 25 best beaches in the world (2006). Thanks to its clear air and lovely golden sand, this romantic stretch of sand was voted the best place in the UK to watch the sun set (Country Living magazine 2005) and one of the top romantic spots in the country (The Guardian 2007).Llangennith Beach, with its soft sands, consistent beach break and great facilities, was listed as the best place to learn how to surf in Britain by The Observer (2006) and one of the 10 'classic surfing beaches by The Guardian (2007). Gower also claims Britain's Best Beach, Three Cliffs Bay. The Gower landmark topped the BBC Holiday Hit Squad nationwide competition (2006) and was voted Britain's best camping beach by The Independent thanks to its superb setting and quiet location (2007). Three Cliffs Bay also made the final of the ITV series Britain's Favourite View \u2013 the only nomination in Wales and backed by singer Katherine Jenkins. Nearby Brandy Cove came sixth in an online poll to find the UK's top beach for the baby boomer generation (2006). Beaches which won 2006 Blue Flag Beach Awards are: Bracelet Bay, Caswell Bay, Langland Bay, Port Eynon Bay and Swansea Marina (one of the few Blue Flag Marinas in Wales). All of these beaches also won a Seaside Award 2006. Limeslade was awarded the Rural Seaside Award and the Green Coast Award. Other Green Coast Awards went to Pwll Du, Rhossili Bay and Tor Bay.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nSwansea has a range of activities including sailing, water skiing, surfing, and other watersports, walking and cycling. Part of the Celtic Trail and the National Cycle Network, Swansea Bay provides a range of traffic-free cycle routes including along the seafront and through Clyne Valley Country Park. The Cycling Touring Club CTC has a local group in the area. Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower have a selection of golf courses.Prior to closure in 2003, Swansea Leisure Centre was one of the top ten visitor attractions in the Wales; it has been redeveloped as an indoor waterpark, rebranded the 'LC', and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 March 2008. The Wales National Pool is in Swansea.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nSwansea has a number of pubs, bars, clubs, restaurants and a casino. Swansea had two casinos until 30 August 2012 when Aspers closed. The majority of city centre bars are situated on Wind Street, with various chains represented including JD Wetherspoon, Revolution, Varsity, Yates's and Walkabout. Some venues feature live music. The Mumbles Mile, described by the BBC as \"one of Wales's best-known pub crawls\", declined in the early 21st century and a number of local pubs were converted into flats or restaurants.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPortal:Wales\nSwansea Bus Museum\nSwansea Philharmonic Choir\n\n\n== Twinning ==\n\nSwansea is twinned with:\n Cork, County Cork, Munster, Ireland\n Mannheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany;\n Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France\n Bydgoszcz, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland.It also has a friendship link with Nantong, China.\n\n\n== Freedom of the City ==\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the City of Swansea.\n\n\n=== Individuals ===\nAdmiral Rt Hon Lord Nelson : 14 August 1802.\nRt Hon Sir William Hamilton : 14 August 1802.\nJohn Henry Vivian : 6 October 1834.\nRt Hon William Ewart Gladstone : 26 May 1887.\nField Marshal Rt Hon Sir Francis Grenfell : 11 October 1889.\nSir Henry Morton Stanley : 16 July 1890.\nRt Hon Lord Swansea: 20 July 1893.\nSir John Jones Jenkins: 19 June 1895.\nRt Hon Lord Rosebery : 29 November 1901.\nRt Hon Sir Samuel Evans : 18 March 1908.\nAdelina Patti: 15 November 1911.\nSir John Dillwyn-Llewellyn : 21 January 1914.\nDavid Davies : 21 January 1914.\nRoger Beck: 21 January 1914.\nJohn Dyer : 21 January 1914.\nRt Hon David Lloyd George : 19 June 1918.\nRt Hon Lord Haig : 17 May 1922.\nAlderman David Matthews : 15 July 1924.\nDavid Williams : 15 July 1924.\nRt Hon Lord McGowan : 15 March 1939.\nWilliam Owen : 15 March 1939.\nDavid John Davies : 15 March 1939.\nRt Hon Sir Robert Menzies : 29 April 1941.\nRt Hon Peter Fraser : 16 July 1941.\nField Marshal Lord Montgomery of Alamein : 16 June 1948.\nRt Hon David Grenfell : 18 February 1953.\nAlderman Daniel Evans : 18 February 1953.\nGeorge William Peacock: 18 February 1953.\nPercy Morris : 19 February 1958.\nRt Hon Lord Callaghan of Cardiff : 29 November 1993.\nHRH Prince of Wales: 24 May 1994.\nPresident James Earl Carter Jr.: 11 August 1995.\nHerr Gerhard Widder of Mannheim: 18 November 1995.\nRt Hon Donald Anderson : 11 February 2000.\nJohn Charles : 4 March 2001.\nRt Hon Rowan Williams : 31 July 2010.\nMel Nurse: 28 April 2016.\nChris Coleman : 20 October 2016.\nSir Karl Jenkins : 4 October 2018.\nAlun Wyn Jones: 13 June 2019.\nCatherine Zeta-Jones : 24 July 2019.\n\n\n=== Military Units ===\nThe Welsh Guards: 15 September 1948.\nThe Welch Regiment: 17 February 1960.\nThe Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers: 15 April 1978.\nThe Royal Regiment of Wales: 20 February 1981.\nHMS Arethusa, RN: 27 June 1981.\nHer Majesty's Coastguard (Swansea Station): 8 December 1982.\nThe Mumbles Lifeboat Station, RNLI: 23 April 1987.\nThe Royal Welch Fusiliers: 20 January 1994.\nHMS Scott, RN: 15 September 2006.\nThe Royal Welsh: 13 September 2008.\n215 (City of Swansea) Squadron Air Training Corps: 12 March 2016.\nHMS Cambria, RNR: 17 March 2018.\n157 (Welsh) Regiment, RLC: 27 July 2019.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity and County of Swansea Council\nSwansea City Centre (website run by council)\nSwansea at Curlie (county)\n \"Swansea\" .

        "wiki": "Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914 \u2013 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" and \"And death shall have no dominion\"; the \"play for voices\" Under Milk Wood; and stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of Laugharne where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in the United States cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early time ===\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (n\u00e9e Williams; 1882\u20131958), a seamstress, and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school. Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906\u20131953), who was eight years his senior. The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home. Thomas's father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as \"son of the sea\", after Dylan ail Don, a character in The Mabinogion. His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles. Dylan, pronounced \u02c8 [\u02c8d\u0259lan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the \"dull one\". When he broadcast on Welsh BBC, early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth. His childhood featured regular summer trips to Llansteffan where his maternal relatives were the sixth generation to farm there. His mother's family, the Williamses, lived in such farms as Waunfwlchan, Llwyngwyn, Maesgwyn and Penycoed. The memory of Fernhill, a dairy farm owned by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones, is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem \"Fern Hill\". Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. Thomas was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, and he was skilful in gaining attention and sympathy. Thomas' formal education began at Mrs Hole's dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home. He described his experience there in Quite Early One Morning:\n\nNever was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime \u2013 the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.\n\nIn October 1925, Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys, in Mount Pleasant, where his father taught English. He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school, preferring reading. In his first year one of his poems was published in the school's magazine, and before he left he became its editor. During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks; the first poem, dated 27 April (1930), is entitled \"Osiris, come to Isis\". In June 1928 Thomas won the school's mile race, held at St. Helen's Ground; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas left school to become a reporter for the South Wales Daily Post, only to leave under pressure 18 months later. Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years, during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive and continued to add to his notebooks, amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934. Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.In his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the Little Theatre in Mumbles, visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea's pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles. In the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as \"The Kardomah Gang\". In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.\n\n\n=== 1933\u20131939 ===\nThomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: \"And death shall have no dominion\", \"Before I Knocked\" and \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\". \"And death shall have no dominion\" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" appeared in The Listener in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was \"the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years\". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves.  A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem \"The Hand That Signed the Paper\" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913\u201394), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish and French descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the \"poetic herald\" for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics. Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were \"intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory\". Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas's.During the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the communists, as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist. He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists.\n\n\n=== Wartime, 1939\u20131945 ===\nIn 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as  The Map of Love. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.At the outset of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as \"an unreliable lung\". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus. After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income. Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.In February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a \"three nights' blitz\". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Caf\u00e9, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: \"Our Swansea is dead\". Soon after the bombing raids, Thomas wrote a radio play, Return Journey Home, which described the caf\u00e9 as being \"razed to the snow\". The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Caf\u00e9 reopened on Portland Street after the war.In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin left their son with his grandmother at Blashford and moved to London. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI). After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post. Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, This Is Colour (a history of the British dyeing industry) and New Towns For Old (on post-war reconstruction). These Are The Men (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. Conquest of a Germ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. Our Country (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.In early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower; one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.In 1944, with the threat of German flying bombs on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaen Cwm near Llangain, where Thomas resumed writing poetry, completing \"Holy Spring\" and \"Vision and Prayer\". In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later work, Under Milk Wood. Of the poetry written at this time, of note is \"Fern Hill\", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid-1945.\n\n\n=== Broadcasting years 1945\u20131949 ===\n\nAlthough Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled \"Reminiscences of Childhood\" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded Quite Early One Morning (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite Early One Morning, and in the three years beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.\n\nBy late September 1945 the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London. The publication of Deaths and Entrances in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in The Spectator, \"This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet\".In the second half of 1945 Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, Book of Verse, broadcast weekly to the Far East. This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished. On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the Third Programme, a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas. He appeared in the play Comus for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus' Agamemnon and Satan in an adaptation of Paradise Lost. Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as \"useful should a younger generation poet be needed\". He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem. Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was \"in every sense a celebrity\".Thomas visited the home of historian A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking \"on a monumental scale\", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse. After a three-month holiday in Italy, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for Under Milk Wood. In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of \u00a32,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. Just before moving into there, Thomas rented \"Pelican House\" opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.\nCaitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949.\n\n\n=== American tours, 1950\u20131953 ===\nAmerican poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk \u2013 going out of his way to shock people \u2013 and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: \"Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?\" Caitlin said in her memoir, \"Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it.\"\nOn returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems, \"In the white giant's thigh\", which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950, and the incomplete \"In country heaven\". 1950 is also believed to be the year that he began work on Under Milk Wood, under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'. The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'. Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'. Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris describes as \"unusually blunt\"; the ribald \"Lament\" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father \"Do not go gentle into that good night\".Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot. Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there. She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat. Thomas would describe the flat as his \"London house of horror\" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin \u2013 after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip. They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements. The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year. One of his works recorded during this time, A Child's Christmas in Wales, became his most popular prose work in America. The original 1952 recording of A Child's Christmas in Wales was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is \"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\".In April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America. He performed a \"work in progress\" version of Under Milk Wood, solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.During this penultimate tour Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden.  They had discussions about collaborating on a \"musical theatrical work\" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of \"the rediscovery of love and language in what  might be left after the world after the bomb.\"  The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his In Memoriam Dylan Thomas for tenor, string quartet, and four trombones. The  first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.After returning home, Thomas worked on Under Milk Wood in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record Under Milk Wood. Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.Thomas's last collection Collected Poems, 1934\u20131952, published when he was 38, won the Foyle poetry prize. Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that \"Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language\". Thomas's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952. In the first few months of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills, three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nThomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by John Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain, there is no record that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox vaccination certificate.Plans called for a first appearance at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who was director of the Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he looked \"pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self\". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.The next day Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was \"rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything\".\n\nOn the evening of 27 October Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour. The next day he took part in Poetry and the Film, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2 am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, \"I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!\" The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11 pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58 am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that \"the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response\". Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, \"Is the bloody man dead yet?\" She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.It is also now believed, however, that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia, as well as emphysema, immediately before his death. In their 2004 book Dylan Remembered 1935\u20131953, Volume 2, David N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: \"The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right.\" Thomas died at noon on 9 November, having never recovered from his coma.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nRumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death. Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death \u2013 pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite the poet's heavy drinking, his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.The publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography Dylan Thomas in America cemented Thomas's legacy as the \"doomed poet\"; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas? claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner \"was even more culpable than his use of morphine\".Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, Caitlin Thomas \u2013 Leftover Life to Kill (1957) and My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story (1997), describe the  effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. \"Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet\", she wrote, and \"The bar was our altar.\" Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and  George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.Thomas died intestate, with assets to the value of \u00a3100. His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne. Thomas's funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin's Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas's coffin. Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side. The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown's Hotel. Thomas's fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote The Times obituary.Thomas's widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him. Thomas's father \"DJ\" died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas's elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012.\n\n\n== Poetry ==\n\n\n=== Poetic style and influences ===\nThomas's refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise. Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed. Instead Thomas is viewed as part of the modernism and romanticism movements, though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful. Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote \"... a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable.\" Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the villanelle \"Do not go gentle into that good night\". His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: \"My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy\".\n\nThomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having been influenced by the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas, finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas. Although Thomas described himself as the \"Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive\", he stated that the phrase \"Swansea's Rimbaud\" was coined by poet Roy Campbell. Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas's mythological pasts into his works such as \"The Orchards\", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the Mabinogion.\nThomas's poetry is notable for its musicality, most clear in \"Fern Hill\", \"In Country Sleep\", \"Ballad of the Long-legged Bait\" and \"In the White Giant's Thigh\" from Under Milk Wood.\nThomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were Mother Goose rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:\n\nI should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance ... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.\n\nThomas was an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.\n\n\n=== As a 'Welsh' poet ===\n\nThomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his Collected Poems, he added \"Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh.\" Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that \"His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background\". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked \"in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of.\"Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's \"whole attitude is that of the medieval bards.\" Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of cynghanedd (consonant harmony) or cerdd dafod (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry. Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: \"rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate.\" Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of cynghanedd in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, Thomas's first in-depth biographer, wrote \"No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan\".Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, \"Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it\". While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama The Three Weird Sisters. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled \"I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism.\" Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked \u2013 \"Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality\". Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of literary magazine Wales, Thomas's father wrote that he was \"afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman\". Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, \"Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry\", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication Llareggub Revisited, \"the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety\u2014not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him.\" The Poetry Archive notes that \"Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively\".Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance. Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947, \"Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding.\" Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading Eighteen Poems, \"The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with Poems and Ballads.\" Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that \"no one can 'stick words into us like pins'... like he [Thomas] can\", but followed that by stating that he \"doesn't use his words to any advantage\". Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.' In 1956, the publication of the anthology New Lines featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated \"Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing\".Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public. In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th. Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers. The BBC Radio programme, Desert Island Discs, in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording. John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common. He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become \"... an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism\", his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nIn Swansea's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour  with the closing lines from Fern Hill.\n\nThomas's home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council. Thomas's writing shed is also preserved. In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30. In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill.\nIn 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas's birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works. Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas's work shed, Sir Peter Blake's exhibition of illustrations based on Under Milk Wood and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas's work. The Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who made a recording of Fern Hill for the event.\n\n\n== List of works ==\n\nThe Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas: The New Centenary Edition.

          "The growth of interest in Dylan Thomas has been quite marked in Swansea. Dylan Thomas pub. pub crawl (in Mumbles) and Ty Llen. The building has a very fine bookshop (all Dylan's works are on offer.) It also has a restaurant on the first floor which serves tasty and",
          "Well worth a visit to this very interactive museum. If you love English this is place for you!! It also is suitable for the younger readers too! Has a caf\u00e9 which is reasonably quiet and has a lovely menu.",
          "Very educational enjoyed reading and learning about this iconic poet from his birth to his passing well worth the visit.",
          "This is a fabulous exhibition which will delight Dylan Thomas fans the world over as well as new comers to his work and his life. The story of the poet's life and work is simply told, using a great balance between interactive display, audio and film presentation and of course",
          "These days, museums and exhibitions try hard to make their displays interactive, and here there are some opportunities, but probably not enough for the gadget-addicted youth of today. The strength of the 'Love the Words' exhibition is what it says on the label: a love of words.",
          "I have visited a number of places associated with Dylan Thomas and read his work. This exhibition was excellent, evocative, informative & atmospheric. I'll visit again as soon as I am able.",
          "Wonderful building- very close to several sites of interest to my family history. A good display and exhibition- DT was a genius who sadly didn't live long enough to fulfill his potential",
          "2nd trip and very impressed with the development and improvements on the exhibition and total experience",
          "I accompanied a professional poet here as a courtesy and found the markers of Dylan Thomas's life and work surprisingly interesting. The exhibits are comprehensive and detailed, with long film clips of Thomas, plentiful articles and objects, and a lot of interpretive text. The",
          "Exhibition is just right - not too long, not too short, very informative and interactive (love those information blocks on wooden cards which gives general information and then if you are interested in more facts you can lift and see the other wooden cards beneath). Well thought",
          "I came here for a poetry reading by 4 Welsh poets which was really good but not very well attended. The centre is only open during the day and does not give the impression of being very busy. I enjoyed the exhibition although it was quite a standard format and didn't have much",
          "I went to the Dylan Thomas Centre as it was to mark 100 years since Dylan's birth. The exhibition was informative and interesting and did not cost anything to visit.",
          "My husband and I visited tor the first time to celebrate the poet's 100th birthday celebrations and I had expected a larger exhibition. Good for brief insights into the poet's life, influences and works. My husband found it informative as he did not know much about Dylan Thomas.",
          "2014 is the centenary of Dylan Thomas' birth, and there are signs all over Swansea promoting \"Dylan Thomas Swansea 2014\". So it was very surprising to discover that the main exhibition at the Dylan Thomas Centre has been closed since mid-August, and will not be re-opening until",
          "As a new exhibition is currently being created the major part of the museum was not open. Were able to see the small temporary exhibition of manuscripts.",
          "Incredibly interesting insight into the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Also beautiful building and lovely cafe inside, next to the museum!",
          "Loved this little centre, just in the middle of refurbishing so lots more to see, an excuse to go back I would say!!! Lots of his letters, poems etc. so lots to read, very small writing so take your specs!! Why they don't blow the letters up separately don't know, then everyone",
          "Noticed the centre as we came back to the hotel from dinner last night and decided to pay a visit this morning. Although small, the exhibition was well laid out and highlighted both the genius of Thomas and also the talents of Richard Burton. Very impressed that there was no",
          "I am a big Dylan Thomas fan so was looking forward to this place. First we struggled to find it, followed signs then they disappeared so it took a bit of effort but we got there in the end. The building is lovely, unfortunately there is one big room for the exhibition and that's",
          "Free to visit and therefore could visit every day while in Swansea. His notebooks were on-view while we were there. Good year to visit Swansea on Dylan's 100th year!",
          "A must for Dylan Thomas fans. This exhibition is in the process of being updated. Everything you needed to know about his life is included as is the people who appeared in his plays. The exhibition is as been mentioned before in two rooms but a lot is in the two rooms. Well",
          "Found this gem by chance. Wonderful, small museum full of information that is the wonder of Dylan Thomas. You couldn't fail to be moved by his melodic voice, talent and this accessible joy. Great way to spend a short time and kds would love it too.",
          "This is a must for anyone who enjoys the works of Dylan Thomas. They have black and white film that is old and takes about an hour but it provides first hand testimony from friends and other people who knew him well. It is well worth watching and provides excellent background on",
          "My son and myself had planned this visit as part of a longterm promise to ourselves to visit South Wales to further our mutual love of Dylan Thomas and his poetry. There is always a sense of trepidation as you feel that sometimes these places do not live up to your expectations.",
          "I only visited the Dylan Thomas exhibit while at the Centre, but was totally blown away. Although I knew the name, I was not familiar with his writing. It seems we never got to 20th century poets in school, having spent so much time on Beowulf and other ancient stuff we couldn't",
          "The small, compact exhibition trying to make sense of Dylan Thomas' life is a masterpiece in economic use of space. The one weak point is the that you can hear the commentaries from other parts so you are never quite immersed in the particular experience before you. All that",
          "Need to know more about DT then this is a good place to go. Just on the edge of town. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff will give you a background and advise the best way to enjoy this wonderful and free experience. Recommend a stop here for anyone visiting Laugharne",
          "Very interesting, starting to look a little tired and needs updating, but it is free and open on a Monday. Wouldn't recommend for young children, but I learnt a lot.",
          "This free museum has 1 large room full of Dylan Thomas info. Lots of reading, many photo's to look at and a few video's to watch. There is also a Gift Shop which sells Dylan Thomas merchandise. We were in and out within 20 mins, but did enjoy it. A pay and display carpark is",
          "Visiting family in Swansea I was quite embarrassed not to know much about Dylan Thomas. What a fantastic place to come if this is you. A free musuem with a room dedicated to Dylan there is a huge amount of information about him to read, listen to and look at. This exhibition is",
          "Right in the heart of Swansea near the docks and harbour, this is a visit well worth making, especially if you are a fan of the Celtic Bard. You will be surprised at how small he was - a complete opposite to the size of his talent and ego! Listening to his sonorous tones as you",
          "I had not visited the centre for several years. Last time I was there, it had a nice little bookshop/cafe and a lovely restaurant. Both are now gone, replaced with nothing in particular. (I've heard the bookshop/cafe moved out when the rent became prohibitive.) Up the filthy",
          "Every person I spoke with at the Dylan Thomas Centre were very helpful in answering my questions and giving advice on further reading. The centre itself was easy to get around. The exhibits were informative without feeling too overwhelming. Seeing this place watching the films",
          "Super for wallowing in all things Thomas. Could have sat for hours listening to Under Milkwood recording. Some personal memorabilia and associated artefacts - all interesting stuff. A big screen that wasn't working (not sure what we missed). Well worth a visit.",
          "A superb exhibition, with a film from the 1950s, telling Dylan's life story.Sympathetically done. Marvellously evocative recordings using his own voice. Parallel display devoted exclusively to 'Under Milk Wood' using memorabilia from the past 60 years. Good selection of books in",
          "Well worth a visit, with good information about this excellent writer.",
          "Quite small and basic...takes about an hour...everything about Thomas...",
          "Fab afternoon spent here, great history lesson and wow what an interesting life Dylan had !",
          "Very informative for Dylan fans and newbies alike.",
          "not well sign posted only filled part of building - sort of felt uncared for. staff helpful, shop good",
          "Particularly wanted to visit this Centre, and I found it very interesting. Seems to be a bit out of the way with a poorly marked entrance. I gather that the University of Wales is taking over the building. It is a pity that the cafe is no longer there.",
          "This wasn't a dry account of DT's life - it was an absorbing story of the man, his upbringing, his likes and dislikes, his whims, the part Swansea had to play, and the fact that there's so much more to him than just Under Milkwood. And afterwards, visit the Swansea Museum and",
          "free exhibition of the great poet, top coffee shop, and venue for regular literary events throughout the year, such as book launches, poetry readings and the one and only Dylan Thomas Festival in November. Watch out for the centenary.",
          "My wife and I had passed the sign for DYLAN THOMAS CENTRE for so many years whilst passing through Swansea on the way to the Gower, that we felt it high time we visited the centre. We had visited his home in Laugharne several times, and I have admired his work since childhood.",
          "Interesting exhibition even if not a D T fan, the tea room is tremendous value and there is a little shop",
          "We have ancestors on both sides of our family who immigrated to America from Wales. So, while we were in London, we decided to take the train and spend the day in Swansea, which is one of the bay towns in southern Wales. Since Dylan Thomas is one of our favorite poets, we spent",
          "The Dylan Thomas Centre is a great looking building that used to be Swansea's Guildhall. It is now dedicated to the life and work of Swansea's most famous son - Dylan Thomas. At the heart of the building is the free permanent collection telling the story of Dylan Thomas' life,"

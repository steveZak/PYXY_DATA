        "wiki": "Place de la Bourse is a square in Bordeaux, France and one of the city's most recognisable sights. Built from 1730 to 1775 along the Garonne River, it was a multi-building development designed by architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. It is within the historic part of the city that has been recognized on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the original plan, a statue of King Louis XV of France was erected in the square. This statue was destroyed during the French Revolution. After the destruction of the statue, a Corinthian column-fountain was built on the square. Finally, in 1869 the sculpture Three Graces was installed in the same location.\nDesign of the surrounding buildings was finished by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1739; the project was issued for construction two weeks after the architect's death. After his death, his son was put in charge and finished the construction of the buildings.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThis square is one of the most representative works of classical French architectural art of the eighteenth century. In the north stood the Palais de la Bourse (current Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bordeaux) and in the south the Hotel des Fermes (now Interregional Directorate of Customs and Indirect Rights, which houses the National Museum of Customs). It was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel between 1735 and 1738. The sculptures represent Minerve protecting the arts and Mercury favoring the commerce of the city.\nIn 2007 it was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is a wonderful place to visit. We came twice and were lucky that on both occasions it was a beautiful sunny day. This square dates back to the 18th century and is symbolic of the beauty of Bordeaux. It is outside the original fortification walls of the city and is on a wide",
          "Visited the place during the rain. So didn\u2019t really enjoyed the view. It was very windy and the water fountain thing ( mirror) was closed. Otherwise it was great architecture!",
          "One of the more prominent buildings in Bordeaux. Overlooking the Water Mirror and with a great fountain in the middle of the courtyard this place is amazing in the summer and still breathtaking in the winter.",
          "The large open square dominates the riverside by the old town. It is backed by 18th century French classical style buidings giving the square its grandeur. A pretty fountain is in the centre. The \"Miroir d'eau\" really turns the square into a spectactular sight both at day and",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful feature and like everything here it\u2019s different both day and night. Strongly Recommended.",
          "Although we ddn't spend as much time as we wanted in Bordeaux, I loved it. It's a mini-Paris with plenty of restaurnats, shopping, attractions and of course wine :) Well worth it",
          "Lots of scaffolding and covers detracting from what should be a beautiful place. Not advertised as such either!",
          "It is a nice square with a beautiful fountain, that gets pretty crowded on a warm sunny evening. It is close to an old entrance into the old Bordeaux town, so might as well go through it on your way in.",
          "Sometimes touristic sights don\u2019t live up to the high expectations created by professional pictures. For us, Place de la Bourse was one of them. In winter, the famous Water Mirror (\u2018Miroir d\u2019eau\u2019) was closed, there was no water in the Fountain of the three Graces and some of the",
          "Without the water mirror working, there is nothing there to see. Just a set of simetrical buildings. A disapointment.",

          "But I\u2019m here in winter and the square is dominated by a very large car advertisement. Some of the buildings are covered in a cover that looks like the buildings and this is a great idea but money must talk so a very large car advertisement has been pinned to the building. It\u2019s",
          "Thanks to the wine industry, a \"safe\" location (it was not a significant target in WW II), and a bold mayor; the city has survived and thrived. The buildings are quite nice and the river setting is spectacular. The reflecting pool is a nice touch. Since we were on a river",

          "Looking at old photos of Bordeaux, I have learned that the fountain/statue in this plaza was actually originally in the Allee Tourney. As the riverfront area was cleaned up after the working port moved to the new location. this was moved to this location. Really nice place to",

          "A beautiful place in old Bordeaux. Would have been even better if not for the heat wave. Directly across the street from the water mirror, you get the opportunity for some lovely photographs. Not really a whole lot more to do other than soak in the scenery.",

          "I\u2019m wild about all palaces. This ones\u2019 a true gem. Arrive early. Sign up for a good tour. Worth the price. Experience one of the most lavish decors and furnishings ever. So very well preserved with great care. Staff friendly. Prepare to wait on long lines in tourist high summer",

          "An unusual concept, one minute a shallow puddle creating a mirror effect of the square behind & then changing to a misted plateau. Both pleasing to all who are present, especially to children & pets playing in the water to cool off. Music & people celebrating/meeting up all",

          "Only 2cms of water, but it does it in style. First it is dry, then it sprays mist, then fills up from underneath with the intention of providing this mirror reflection of Place de la Bourse. In 30C + heat it becomes a giant play area for adults, couples, children and one crazy",
          "This was a great place on a scorching hot day in Bordeaux. Every Walk of life were there cooling their feet, paws, beaks and some of the kids were there rolling around in water. Only draw back was there pavement was black and there was no shade so it was a quick cool off and",
          "This broad square is right in the heart of Bordeaux, situated beside the Garonne River and in front of a line of classically elegant French buildings dating from the 18th century. It is one of the symbols of this lovely city. A recent addition to the square is the Miroir d'Eau",

          "Visited Bordeaux after 20+ years. It was a dump then and it still is! The whole city is being dug up. There is rubbish everywhere,weeds on the pavements and dog muck. Army to control 12 gilets jaunes aged 70+whilst tramps lying in shop doorways and mothers begging on stteets",

          "Beautiful, elegant and a lovely place to visit on a fine Spring day. Not so much in bad weather, as it is an outdoor experience and the wind would be very cold. Great example of the architecture and urban development of the 18th century.",
          "A highway for people traffic past restaurants and leading to the shopping streets off here.The customs house exhibition gives a history of the changes from it offices in the Place.",
          "I think a lot of people must come here, as the top attraction in the city and wonder what the fuss is about, particularly if you are well travelled. Its very average. Was helped no end by the lady inside the architectural tourist attraction there",
          "You feel in Paris but surrounded by friendly place and enjoying a more relaxed experience! Within walking distance there are plenty of restos for the Foody crowd!",
          "Great view and atmosphere around this beautiful city. All easily walked. Attractive buildings everywhere clean and well worth visiting.",
          "Bordeaux is really one of the most beautiful cities I have visited. The place de la Bourse is an amazing par of the old town!",
          "We were here in the rain so we were able to see the reflection acriss the street on the water mirror. I am sure it is better when they have water in it. The building on the right side was being refinished and there was a lot of scaffolding covering the building. The fountain was",
          "Such a lovely range of buildings. Bordeaux has a great atmosphere. Lots of nearby places to eat and drink.",
          "We were there in the end of March and there is no water on the square so we missed a special effect. So nice place but ...",
          "We were just there (in March) and it appears the fountains/water features and some other things don\u2019t open until April. Just an FYI",
          "We went here to make some \"mirror photos of this World Heritage building, but there was no water and the fountain didn't work and the building was in scaffolding so we were slightly disappointed. Real first of April 2019.",
          "I got to enjoy this landmark during the day and night. Unfortunately during the night times I went, the water mirror was not functioning. Maybe it has a closing time? I would still recommend a visit",
          "No water as yet on the \"mirror\" but it still looked magnificent. Lovely place to sit and watch the world go by.",
          "I was disappointed that I expected the experience, it was not listed anywhere that the attraction was not active ..",
          "great to walk along the Garonne to finally admire this squarr which mixes architecture from the 1800s with a contemporary touch (water mirror)",
          "You'd think you where in Paris. The place isd majestic, a bit like Place Vendome in Paris. The grandeur of the buildings make it a place to see...",
          "A must see in Bordeaux but can't see how you would miss it. Highly recommend seeing in daytime and at night. The view of the Gironde River and Napolean's bridge from the pond area are also striking.",
          "Start past the Saint Jean Railway Station and stroll towards the Cit\u00e9 du Vin. Enjoy the riverside, the beautiful Pont de Pierre. Solemn H\u00f4tels, beautiful houses adorn this river walk, so make sure to look both right and left until you come to this incredible vista : The Place",
          "I have been in Bordeaux the whole weekend and haven't seen this mirror image once. Even if it's off for the weekend their is no notice to inform tourists.",
          "I pass there every week or so - lovely point of view to admire the sunset, people passing by, or the miroir d'eau!",
          "I hopped off to grab a photo and wander around the area, and it definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint. Even in the rain, it was beautiful!",
          "Came for the Siblu sales conference and I can safely say that this was probably the best one I\u2019ve been to since 2012. The room looked fantastic and in a great setting.",
          "Perhaps not seen at its best on a soggy, late-January day but the architectural lines are elegant and inspire confidence.",
          "If you fancy a stroll in the evening or during the day this is perfect. Came out of our hotel to stretch our legs at night and it was lovely to pass by Place Royale. Feels safe also.",
          "Eventhoug it was raining, I enjoyed it a lot. I found it big and impressive. The water mirror wasn't working though",
          "Beautiful beautiful building and spectacular at night. While there is some renovations underway it is still worth a visit.",
          "I cannot see why this is such an attraction. Granted we were there in November and there was scaffolding across half the buildings, but I seriously don't see what all the hype is about. Could easily miss this one off the list. Sorry guys.",
          "I\u2019m sure if you go in Summer, it would be nice not only for taking pictures but also for leisure. It\u2019s a hotspot for visitors. It\u2019s also a starting point for the protests of the lately Yellow Jacket movement in Bordeaux.",
          "This is a place to go for a walk. There are also many restaurants and cafes to stop and enjoy the view.",
          "If you are visiting Bordeaux this is one of the first places to see. Best at sunset or at night when everything shines",
          "The square is very beautiful and looks very french. It's located right in the center of the city. Worth visiting, very impressive!",
          "We saw Place de la Bourse in rain and shine. Each time it presented another exquisite facet of its remarkable architecture. Not to be missed, also, is the Garrone river just across the street. A perfect location to understand Bordeaux' place in the development of the wine",
          "This is a really cool place to take photos. If the sun in behind you, take a photo and you can get your reflection in the tiles! A must see in the day and at night.",
          "Wherever you look, you\u2019re just bound to see a beautiful view. Either the historic buildings facing the fountain, or the banks of the Garonne just flowing alongside.",
          "Stand in the square and look at the classic architecture with great symmetry. Then turn around and look to the river and the busy pedestrian quai which flanks it. You have a sensation of immense space and beauty.",
          "Great sight to take in. The fountain was off when we came, and part of the building was being refurbished, but still very much worth visiting.",
          "Very nice place at the edge of the Garonne. Too bad there is a wing of buildings under renovation. We enjoyed the fountain in the center of the square and the water mirror. Beautiful with evening lights.",
          "Large open space bounded by typically French architecture. Stroll round and enjoy the ambience. Looks quite spectacular at dusk when they turn on the lights.",
          "Impressive building. Love the installation in front of the building. Fell upon it as a walk along the river. Highly recommend a good stroll to walk off all the amazing food and wine we had during our fabulous weekend in Bordeaux",
          "This is the regular square for every town. No specific. Lots of restaurants around. Possibly its better on summer time.",
          "If you\u2019d like to take lot of pictures and enjoy beautiful views this is the place to go to. We visited in November and the views were absolutely stunning!",
          "I have been told that if there is a place to celebrate a civic event you will find the people there. The best part there are about 1300 parking spaces on 2 levels below you. About \u20ac27 a day. The office to the parking is on Place de la Bourse. Once there was a Louis 14th? statue",
          "Nice to walk through and a very interesting feature right by the port where the river boats are moored.",
          "If you are in Bordeaux it is a must to go to the Place de la Bourse. It sits on the banks of the river. Great restaurants and bars. It looks fabulous at night time. Children play in the fountains across the road.",
          "We stay there during the sunset time, so we saw the place with sun and the night view as well. This is the place that one must not drop in your stay in Bordeaux.",
          "We were in Bordeaux for a few days and did lots of walking (and drinking!). This was very impressive but undergoing renovations and lots of scaffolding. The Hotel de la Bourse looked busy and very impressive- especially at night! Equestrian statue of the king was impressive too.",
          "Bordeaux has many fine old buildings and this one is very impressive and large! We stopped to look at this on our way to the Miroir d'Eau and the river.",
          "This masterpiece of architecture is an unavoidable site in Bordeaux. Monumental, breathtaking, worth taking a look in daytime or evening. A place not to miss or forget",
          "This Palais is but 1 of 10 attractions that can be visited on a 2-3h walking tour around the historic centre of Bordeaux. But be warned, at 2.5E/h car parking is tr\u00e8s expensive!!!",
          "Busy place - so pick a slow time of day to have a look. Right on the tram stop and near the river. Easy to get to. Enjoy and happy travels.",
          "Place de la Bourse is the center of everything. Kind of the heart of Bordeaux. There is an energy there that is one of a kind. It's a wonderful spot for photos. But, be aware. There are no yellow lights in Bordeaux. As you're crossing the street, the light goes from green to red",
          "There's a water mirror and then a misty fog. Pretty reflections and fun to walk through. A lovely park along the river too.",
          "Stunning architecture making a statement of symmetry and gracefulness. In the centre is the Fontaine of the Three Graces from 1869. Just a perfect backdrop for the Mirror of Water",
          "Such an expansive and beautiful square, with interesting sculpture and fountains. Huge buildings surrounding it are so impressive. A great place to wander around and drink in the history.",
          "Did not go in but from the outside it is a beautifuul building so we had astroll close up and sat near by to admire it",
          "Bordeaux has a rich architectural ensemble which was designated UNESCO World heritage. This square is one of the great examples of baroque style. The proportions of both the buildings and the square are very elegant and the fountain in the middle is great art. Good place to walk",
          "At night, the uplighting to the buildings is illuminated in the water mirror, adding a whole new dimension to the plaza. Our ship docked up close so we could enjoy it on several different levels. The plaza has a beautiful fountain in the center, just about right in front of",
          "This has to be experienced both during the day and all lit up at night. It\u2019s simply stunning. I could keep returning to Bordeaux just to see Place de la Bourse and the Miroir D\u2019Eau.",
          "Bordeaux is probably one of my favourite city visits. Beautiful, stylish and relaxed. So much to see whilst walking about. The buildings and history are fascinating. Really loved it.",
          "If you are in Bordeaux it is a nice place to visit and take a couple of pictures, especially at night",
          "Impressive how this natural mirror works - for sure a nice and beautiful sight to visit for the whole family! We took some great pictures and had a lot of fun cooling down in August running through the cool fog.",
          "Place de la Burse is really beautiful, by the river and with a water fountain that reflects the buildings. Great photo opportunity! While there, have some wine or a bear at Le Gabriel, or dine there if you can, great views!",
          "This place is incredible, we walked in there every single day we were in Bordeaux. The fountain is majestic, so is the building. Well swerved by the trolley and a nice view of the Garonne river.",
          "We live in France and decided to tour the south of France, whilst staying in bordeaux which has to be one of the best cities in france to visit we toured around the Place de la Bourse and found it not only captivating and historical but a beautiful part of the city. Highly",
          "This became our focal point for our visit. From our hotel we were able to take the tram and stopped off here and from here we explored the old town and finding some lovely restaurants nearby such as chez et Lilly a must go to place",
          "Place de la Bourse is a large plaza in the middle of Bordeaux with a huge fountain. While walking around Bordeaux, make sure you pay a visit. It is very photogenic. The tram stop is also called Place de la Bourse.",
          "Everyone gathers here at sunset. Huge fountain in the center. Grab a pricey drink at the bar overlooking the massive center and people watch.",
          "A delightful place to sit or stroll around with the never ending flow of people going about their business or sight seeing . Numerous restaurants and cafes close by and of course the river across the road where you will witness river cruise vessels and larger vessels berthing.",
          "The water rises and falls, but is never deeper than 2 inches. The great thing about it is that it is Free. Ensure that when booking a hotel in Bordeaux that it is on the Tram Line. We stayed at Gare St Jean where there are 3 Ibis Hotels that are chea and on the 'C' Line that",
          "The quality of the architecture and design shows what a very rich city Bordeaux was in the past. The buildings remain in exceptional repairs. The view along the quayside is fantastic especially as it begins to light up at night It is definitely a city worth seeing. Presumably",
          "A stunning building - next time we will spend more time here as we are only in Bordeaux for a few days.",
          "I didn't know what to expect but a wet pavement, really? Surely they could have come up with a better spectacle",
          "The square - if that's what it is- is ok but not that spectacular. The buildings have the almost standard French grandeur so it's nice to walk around. Don't expect anything more than that.",
          "Nice place to have a stroll and admire what Bordeaux has established in recent years. The mirror of water reflects the palace in the background. Adults and kids alike have fun in the occasional steam that emerges :)",
          "the water mirror is spectacular and when it turns into steam and mist it just becomes magical. always full of people. the buildings here are really special.",
          "was walking in this area during the sunset. very cool place also to have a jogging . I was not with my camera but it is a place to bring one for sure",
          "The Miroir d'eau is great to slip off your shoes and paddle about in the shallow water to cool down (some people get a bit more involved and wet!) after a stroll along the Garonne or a tour of the city, but the prices at the bars / restaurants over the road in the Place de la",
          "Beautiful place to hang out! Just off the city centre, an excellent day to end your day of shopping, with great restaurants, bars, views of the river, all very accessible by public transport, a beautiful water feature on the floor has everybody running around barefoot! Stunning",
          "We visited during the night and the lighting was wonderful. Didn't know that wr nedd to go across the road to look at the reflection. We came to the same place next morning. The reflection made by a simple layer of water is one to see. Highly recommended.",
          "I highly recommend visiting Bordeaux. It is a great small town with a big city feel, friendly people, great weather and close to both Right Bank and Left Bank wineries. I highly recommend wine tours to both areas. Fun and someone else drives.",
          "Beautiful architecture and nice to look at from the quays. Located in the heart of the city. Better to visit during the spring or summer seasons.",
          "Went to sea the the water mirror and it was amazing. When we arrived we kicked off our shoes and went paddling. Everyone of all ages was smiling. The water went lower and the whole granite bed looked like a mirror. Then it started to spray up fine water mist and it created a",
          "This is a great square to meet friends in or start your treck through the more historic part of Bordeaux. There's a nice restaurant on the square, the tram runs by the square, and it can be a good place to get picked up by a planned ride.",
          "Makes an impressive image rIght along the water. A large water jets/steam \u201cfountain \u201c across the road gives tourists something to do.",
          "Bordeaux is a must see place. Outstanding architecture, friendly people, good food. It's easy to get about, just about the perfect city stop. Oh and the wines not too bad either!!",
          "lovely old buildings. its a nice place to visit but really quite busy so suggetst you go early for photos",
          "Viewed the Place de la Bourse from an open top bus tour, it was a lovely hot day with the water fountains and tourists enjoyed being cooled.",
          "Seeing this yesterday was great. Waiting until sunset gives you some great pictures and it is nice to just sit on the steps and watch people wall by.",
          "This are appears to be the place to meet. The water mirror opposite the Place de la Bourse was always popular and the reflections of the Bourse on the wet granite are fantastic if the area isn't too busy. The Place has its own tram stop but this has no signs just a small raised",
          "The Place de la Bourse is a stunning area near the Garonne river and certainly worth a visit. It's easy to get to as it's quite centrally located. Housing many historic buildings in a semi circle with a statue / fountain in the middle. The Water Mirror is also just situated",
          "Historic buildings serving as a backdrop to the Miroir d'Eau. Has a wide open courtyard with benches and a large fountain. Wish I could have seen it at night since it is even more beautiful then!",
          "Beautiful building on very impressive square. With the mirror just across the road the difference between old and new architected works really well.",
          "Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful! No other words to describe this place. Best time to visit is towards the evening (around sunset). The whole atmosphere around that place is just marvellous.",
          "A must see place especially in the evening. View of this place on the \"mirror\" is really awesome. Esp when the mist starts in the mirror.",
          "The bourse is listed in most travel guides as a major attraction in Bordeaux, and it is an impressive building. However, unless you have a deep interest in the history of the city there are other places that are a better use of limited time like the Cathedral and the museums.",
          "There should be staff asking visitors not to run across the feature during the 'mirror' period. Totally ruins any holiday photos.",
          "Well, we came during day time, kids were playing with water. Same goes by night during summer. Maybe the mirror glaze is later at night or during winter days.",
          "Good opportunity for a nice photo and chill. Not much shade around so prepare if you going on a hot summer day.",
          "Because this place is much loved--with good reason--if you're intent on getting a good photo of it, be prepared to go there before and after the crowds collect. It's worth the effort!",
          "The place de la bourse was very big and lovely and the water mirror was spraying water everywhere and it looked like there was gas coming out of the sprouts",
          "We didn't realize that the water was a small distance away from this building. But that is probably what makes the view so spectacular. We got back from a train ride from Paris and as we walked back to our ship, we noticed all of the couples, families, young, old, and",
          "Great to cool off when the weather was so hot & in the evening to truly see the reflection in the water",
          "This is an amazing place - probably one of the most famous in Bordeaux - where you can see the reflections of the buildings at the back and look at the Garonne river. Must see in Bordeaux!",

          "The first reminder when you see this beautiful square is Versailles. Built in the same style during 18 cent Age of Enlightenment, this is the most beautiful city square - even without the terrific Water Mirror in front, which is stunning. It was called Royal Sq before, housing a",
          "This whole area is Antarctic. The river views, the whole Bourse Buildings, the pool that reflects, cools, shoots up water sprays. Lots of reasons to come. Not bad for a picnic either",

          "This is a lovely area for children and their parents to pass a few hours of a hot day. Various spouts of water cool the children and with spray it is lovely to see in front of an amazing building. Some say you dont get the mirror view of the buildings behind . Would love to have",
          "In the center of Bordeaux which is a wonderful city to visit, the Place de la Bourse is jusr stunning . In recent years they have introduced low level fountain jets that spring into life every 1/2 hour or so in summer. This produces a magical misty, glistening effect and the",
          "Bordeaux has changed so much since I was there 20 years ago! I think a lot of money must have been spent on making it so beautiful. Had a great time seeing the city, lovely place full of animation and people having a great time. Do go there if you are visiting the area.",
          "We were fortunate to be there one perfect evening during summer when (mostly) children played on the Miroir d'Eau. The view over the Place was as stunning as that out over the Garonne.",

          "In front of this area, you see kids playing at this huge Mirror of Water located right in front of the Place de La Bourse, financial area of Bourdeaux! Very lively area, always crowded, specially in the summer time.",
          "Facing the waterfront with classic 18th century architecture, the Place de la Bourse is the centre of the UNESCO World Heritage area. From the waterfront water plaza to the Tram C to the buildings of the Bourse this is gem - not to be missed. The Customs Museum is reasonably",
          "This was a beautiful structure and we enjoyed it, but we unfortunately did not get a good view. First night, we went after midnight and the mirror had evaporated and all the lights were off (therefore go before midnight!) second night was Bastille day and third night France was",

          "This is a fun place to visit during the day but especially after dark when the water acts like a mirror image of the beautiful lit up buildings across the road. It's a casual place where young children run through the water that's about 2cm deep. The walk along the river is",

          "Fantastic \u2018fountain\u2019 in the center of town. Spent almost an hour here splashing through the huge (but very shallow) pool and enjoying its cooling mists. Shares the same heritage as similar fountains we have visited in London where you are encouraged to get wet, but the size",
          "We stopped for a look on our walking tour of Bordeaux and our 9yo had a lot of fun in the Miroir d'eau. This water feature across the road from the Place de la Bourse was very popular with little kids. The reflections of the Place de la Bourse also are a photographers dream.",
          "We visited here when it was 30c and everyone was enjoying the water spurting from the ground! Kids playing and having fun! The area was very busy with tourists but that is to be expected. Lovely location",

          "Its the most beautiful place in Bordeaux and it is a must visit. It is very easy to get to, but it is closed at night. So if you want to see the water show or take photos after the water just sprayed out to make the reflective effect, best shot is to go in the afternoon.",
          "When there's no wind, the reflections are perfect. Then on comes the cold steam! Kids do cartwheels, jump on the outlets, adults play too. It's a clever idea, and in a picture-perfect location.",

          "This area is a must whilst visiting Bordeaux and for exploring the many streets leading off from this area. Kept very clean and the architecture is impressive",
          "Awesome. Travelling with 3 boys under 5. The boys loved this. They happily got nude and played in the water. Great atmosphere with the Bordeaux Fete Le Vin.",
          "It was such a nice place to enjoy the architecture and the building reflecting in the water. Went there three time to visit, two times during the day and one in the evening. It is a great spot to rest and take pictures. Garone River is right next to it so it the Pont-Neuf",
          "This place is not for nothing one of UNESCO treasures. Beautiful at any weather and any time of a day.",
          "We visited at sunset - so pretty! Nice place to watch people and see the lights come on in the town.",
          "An impressive group of building directly opposit the water mirror and ideal for a rest due to the open space and sense of quiet even with the main road close by. You won't miss this area if you walk by the river or have just had food in one of the nearby squares.",
          "A must see. It has at least three states: a few inches of water, just wet (where it becomes a mirror), and then misting. Great for pictures. You may need to go during the day and night to get good shots.",
          "A very good place to take great pictures, it is a beautiful place but unfortunately we were not lucky to see the mirror.",
          "Just as you see it on photos! Fun for little kids to run and play with water. Runs every half hours.",
          "Great architecture and perfect location across the water mirror. Beautiful sunset photo opportunities",
          "Magical moment for small children as the water mist covers the ground - blanket and picnic required -",
          "Beautiful, charming and free what more could you want? I've been here in the winter and summer both are great times to view the famous 'mirror' magically reflect the gorgeous surrounding architecture.",
          "You really have to see it if you are in Bordeaux. It's breath-taking and very magnificent. No wonder it's rated one of the UNESCO heritage sites",
          "Beautiful square-a must see!we walked this area and also explored the electric car tour too....opposite the river with a great view.",
          "What a wonderful area to stroll; felt safe. Lot\u2019s of fun in the center of Bordeaux with a lot of visitors all enjoying the evening.",
          "This is a spot to visit, we were lucky to see dancers in a photo shoot that played artistically in the water. Great scenery with river and bridge in background, town in front.",
          "The place is brilliant, whether by day with children and dogs splashing in the mist, families happily nearby, or reflecting by night. I got up early to see the architectural mirror of the splendid classical buildings. It is heartwarming to see how many people enjoy this",
          "We only had a day and had intended to visit the art galleries & museums, but it was too sunny a day to be indoors. We got the tram from the rail station into town getting off at Place de la Bourse. The tickets can be bought inside the rail station and are franked by a machine on",
          "I love the history of the city, I also love the fact that although the tram might be in the way every once in a while, they made sure to make them run via underground electricity so that there were not poles and wires blocking the our view of the wonderful buildings. So",
          "Had to see it twice. Simply beautiful and amazed when the smoke appeared, waited for smoke to appear again to capture the view",
          "With its night lighting, the view is stunning at night. We enjoyed it from our river cruise ship on a perfect evening.",
          "Fountains were not on and we could have not take this popular mirror photos for which this place is famous!",
          "Beautiful mirror effect and fun to play in the fog created by the water. Lots of photo opportunities during day and night.",
          "Well worth just admiring the excellent archictecture of this magnificent esplanade of buildings overlooking the river",
          "The Bourse building itself is a very artistic building with the columns and the great statues on top, the area is full of fashion shops, restaurants & cafeteria, coffee shops and ice cream shops, but the most interesting thing is the tramway that is very modern and exist right",
          "Le Miroir d'eau is an awesome attraction to see. Built in 2006 the reflecting pool is one of the world's largest and captures the Place de la Bourse in its reflections. At times mist is released, and it was lovely to see a few children running into the mist to play and their",
          "Spend 15 minutes here just admiring the stone carving and detailing of the buildings and people watch too,as they get on and off the trams passing nearby!",
          "Place de la bourse is beautiful with the river and the water mist that is the largest in Europe a lovely square looking on to the water and river",
          "Attractive architecture to see but still rather dull. Pleasant enough while passing but not enough to draw you to it in its own right.",
          "The Bourse, on the Garonne River, houses the Chamber of Commerce. It is most impressive at night, as it is beautifully lit. The plaza in front hums with activity.",
          "This is stunning. The square is typical French architecture, which I love, but the magic is in the \u201cwater mirror\u201d in front. The design is ingenious and it is a gathering place for everyone, young and old. Just take off your shoes and party. The most fun is watching the little",
          "The pictures do not do this justice. It is absolutely amazing, you need to make time to see it! It is right across from the water mirror, so you get to see 2 sights at once. It's also right on the water.",
          "Very nice place in the center of Bordeaux city. It's possible running on the river side ! Good time !",
          "It is beautiful and very typical of the 18th century with open space just in front of the Garonne river.",
          "Walked to the square from our rental. Great photo spot. Lots of activity and people. Waited a while to get some shots. But enjoyed the place and atmosphere. The area is surrounded by pedestrian only streets with awesome shops, bars and restaurants. Must see spot.",
          "Such a lovely place to visit. Beautiful architecture and usually busy with people walking around admiring the building.",
          "Main square of the city in front of the la Garonne. Many historical buildings and pieces of art. Happens to be first of May and all the flags crowd the square. Also many children and families enjoying the day off.",
          "Not really a fountain and not very interesting. The best thing here is the restaurants behind the Bourse on rue des Faussets. Also you can catch the batboat here on the river",
          "One of the main attractions in Bordeaux and definitely worth seeing. Take the time to stroll down the quay and enjoy the views.",
          "Well this is the place to go in Bordeaux as it has this little something with the \"mirror\" and the Garonne at the back!",
          "Really nice palace and river area, very tourist friendly with great vibes. Lovely during day or at night.",
          "Luckily the weather was fabulous for April. Picnic lunch and great photo opportunity. Definitely worth a walk. Follow the. Tour on the local tourist map and you will see all the important sights. I",
          "All ages enjoy this attraction. Simple idea and mesmerising. Great photos whatever the weather! Even though it can get busy there is plenty of room to spread out and get your shot.",
          "Be sure to see this palace lit up with the mirror fountain in front of it. Take pictures from the riverside Stunning!",
          "One of, if not the top attraction in Bordeaux, this large square, located along the riverfront is the cities\u2019 centerpiece. It is framed by governmental buildings and contains the Three Graces fountain. It was inaugurated in 1749. This is a great place to experience Bordeaux.",
          "This place is the must see location of Bordeaux. From here you can visit or the city center or the riverside . Huge underground parking facilities .",
          "Very nice, pure French architecture from the past good place to take pictures , have a walk along the river to the \" pont saint Pierre\"",
          "Very crowded, but don't miss this place during the night - as it is spectacular when the lights are reflected on the pond...!",
          "Love architecture to see from the Bordeaux tourist bus tour or simply walking along the Garonne River. No entry fee. It was built in 1730.",
          "We went here onour first night & it was beautiful. The square was enlighted and it\u2019s simply beautiful. Near the area are lots of resturants, unfortunately there was no water on the so cold water Mirror that could have better the attraction.",
          "Beautiful and wonderful place to visit. Vibrant atmosphere with loads of people and market shops. Recommend this as a must see place in Bordeaux",
          "View from quay side stunning, more could be made of the square for tourists. Museums closed Easter Monday, and water mirror not functioning",
          "This is truly worth seeing. The huge square is bordered with amazing old architecture and has a huge monument in the centre. It is right near the river and has the big square across from it that turns it into a huge flat mirror at night and reflects the lights in the square and",
          "The reflection pool is on the must-see list and it is interesting but only for one cycle of the waterworks. It will be crowded with kids and harder to appreciate what is happening from an engineering point of view but you will understand. Check a website for the specs, they are",
          "This is a \u2018must visit\u2019 site in Bordeaux because of the superb architecture. As much as I could ascertain, there were not many activities to do once you were there other than snap photographs. However, several nice cafes nearby for lunch.",
          "This is wonderful situated right beside the river. The fountain in the square had hoarding up when we visited which meant those photo ops were not as good as they could have been.",
          "it really looks splendid from the riverfront, looking accross the field of water (fountain) along the facades of the Place de la Bourse. Bordeaux at its best.",
          "We were here for half marathon and the palace was lit up with different colours in the night. The street lights are very special. It\u2019s unfortunate that we could not see the water mirror because it was taken by the organisers of the half marathon...",
          "We were very lucky to stay just off the square and after three days we were taking its beauty for granted. It is a stunning square which is equally impressive during the day or at night. A must see in Bordeaux.",
          "The place was amazing! We never thought it was this beautiful! Very scenic and the people are wonderful :)",
          "I had such o lovely time around bordoeux. Only problem i had is they dont speak english in restaurants or bars..Very few of them.Apart of that no any other complaints.",

          "Really good place with a great open view. If you enjoy architecture then this place is great to visit",
          "The symetry, the majestic harmony of the classical XVIII century architecture of the square, reminescent of the riches of the city and its glorious past due to colonial ( including slave ) trade, wine...is best seen from the opposite bank of the Garonne river, and worth seeing",
          "Beautiful square and probably one of the most important landmark of Bordeaux. Good to visit by day or night.",
          "The water mirror reflect all the lights of the place at night time! splendid ! Just go before 11pm otherwise you will miss the lights!",
          "Nice to wander to and see the sights. Kids had a ball in the water mirror while it was charging up, nice place for a stroll.",
          "I am lucky as I cycle past this landmark every day. As certain comments suggest, it sometimes doesn't have any water: in winter (from November to April) and also sometimes due to events as the Eurocup or such. An ideal, short route would go between the Porte Cailhau and the",
          "What a beautiful city. So easy to walk everywhere and so flat. Was lucky with beautiful weather in September. Plenty to do and to see.",
          "A must to see. So very beautiful. No water during winter but the architecture of the place is worth the detour",
          "Bordeaux is a beautiful city with a lot of history, yet this novelty is so cool that I recommend you to start your day here! the smile will stay with you for the rest of the day! If you like to take photos, then the reflection is simply magical! :) the show takes twice every",
          "Stumbled on this sight first during my run through the city and really liked it. The view of the palaces on one side and the river bank on the other made it very romantic looking - especially an night when lit.",
          "The evening view after rain is simply amazing. Must visit place during the day and night. Highly recommend to visit in the evening.",
          "We did a walk along (or near) the river to look at the old port buildings. We passed the OTT memorial to the Girondins, the Customs Office and Museum and the Place de la Bourse on our way to the Porte Cailhou. An interesting walk (even in the rain) but Place de la Bourse is not",
          "Lovely place to take lovely pics - a must see for every Bordeaux visitor. Great for kids to splash around in as well",
          "When we visit we didn\u2019t see water there, maybe because was too cold. However, it\u2019s a beautiful place in Bordeux to take a nice picture",
          "One of the most attractive places in Bordeuax. You can enjoy the view of the river and mirror d eau. If you visit this town you must enjoy the beauty of this place.",

          "So interesting to walk along the river and enjoy the different parts of the day and the amazing photo opportunities.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous building and surrounding area. Really recommend the nearby \u2018Le Miroir d\u2019eau\u2019 especially during the hotter months",
          "Visually and architecturally spectacular (outside and in), its a real show piece. Extremely clever use of contemporary electronic devises and VR enhance the experience. At the end, you have to pick a single wine from maybe 8 or 9, and are served with a pour that in my view,",
          "Beautiful place even if the weather was not on our favour.. The pictures came out ok and the place is just very beautiful to see",

          "Even if you're only in Bordeaux for an hour, make your way the Place de la Bourse. The building really is magnificent. Pictures don't capture all the beauty of this building and scene.",

          "Was there in the evening. the water reflects the building perfectly. nice walk n romantic. haven't seen daytime reflection, but I think night is beautiful.",
          "Visited during a crisp evening. Very pretty promenade with this palace at its centre and river Garone at the face.",
          "I was impressed with the grandness of this square, a Royal impression. You will be spoilt for angles for a photo, either to centralise around the fountain or at a wider angle to incorporate the grand square royal buildings around the square or from across the water mirror across",
          "One of the loveliest places I've been! Taking long rides there by bike or by foot especially in the afternoon.",
          "I was absolutely impressed with Bordeaux and one of highlights for me was the Place de la Bourse with its 'lake'. The water gives fantastic reflections from the surrounding buildings and if you are interested in 'arty' photography, this is the place to go.",
          "Do not miss this place that offers so much fun no matter the age. Like a bonus, you may end up with the best photo of the day.",
          "One of the main touristic sites of Bordeaux. Nice place, with the water at front and the beautiful building surrounding it. We went by noon and it was amazing",
          "...for kids & adults alike. Esp. beautiful on a night tour when everything is lit up and reflected. New liked watching kids play in the water too in the daytime.",
          "This square is quintessential Bordeaux. It\u2019s beautiful at anytime of day and in any weather. Its beauty is both understated and unparalleled at the same time, and cements Bordeaux to be one of the best cities in France.",
          "Every time we went anywhere, we always found ourselves mesmerized by the sight. Whether it was just a glazed expanse, or had the water fountains flowing, or just the mist. . . A must for any tourist.",
          "These building are impressive but really are worth seeing at night when they are lit up beautifully. Great fun to take your photos with the reflection.",
          "An attractive square on the waterfront with lovely buildings arranged in a symmetrical pattern around the reflecting pool.",
          "The building itself is nice, but nothing very special. But at dark times, the beautifully lit building and the view from the water mirror was definitely worth a visit.",
          "Wow, what a beautiful Palace. Really sets off the public place of the city. Not open for tours but I'm told it can toured on one day a year. Mostly official city offices.",
          "This distinctive building has a couple of restaurants and venues, but I am writing to point out that it also gives its name to a tram stop on the B line. Get off here to see the water mirror. Also, go just to the right of that central building and you will be on one of the",

          "This a beautiful architectural sight that is best viewed at night, when it is illuminated. Whether viewed by day or night, walk over to the riverside and take photos of the place over the 'water mirror' which will give you some lovely photos with reflections of the buildings.",
          "It is a main plaza of the city and an important 18th-century landmark. Let's say it is a provincial replica of Place Vendome in Paris. Place de la Bourse is incredibly day and night, and it's absolutely two different impressions. It took 20 years of hard work in the 18th",
          "Highly recommend to visit in the morning or afternoon to get the best shot from the water mirror. Easy to walk back to the area around the theater for a good coffee",

          "The river front of Bordeaux has gone through renovations and is a very pleasant area to stroll in good weather. One can take in the Place and the Water Mirror in front of it as well as the Monument aux Girondins in one trip. There are benches along the river to sit and enjoy",
          "The buildings are architecturally beautiful and it is hard to believe it is just a financial center and not a palace, and shows the importance Bordeaux gave trade in age where buildings were meant to be beautful. You see it from the Mirror, and pass between its buildings going",

          "Lovely setting by the river which is very open so you get a great panoramic view of the crescent shaped buildings.",
          "While in Bordeaux this space was always interesting and vibrant. A display of urban garden produce ( including live chickens) was interesting, as was the range of produce. At night time the people visiting the area brought the place alive. Very pleasant just to stroll around",

          "It was a bit of a cloudy day, but still warm for October, and Place de La Bourse looked resplendent - even though there was no sunshine. Impressive buildings constitute the square comprising La Bourse (Stock Exchange) and La CCI (Chamber of Commerce & Industry). An imposing",
          "Not only does it have the huge reflecting sheet of water that reflects the impressive buildings and sky but you\u2019re in the heart of the city looking a mile or two in both directions of the river. Movingly beautiful place.",

          "It's really amazing as I saw from the reviews. Our baby couldn't stop playing and running on very warm day. We parked our car just in one minute walk from the place, there's very cosy underground parking. Just one bad thing that there is no toilets around (( It's a busy place",

          "The beautiful architecture of the Bourse and other public buildings make a stroll around the area a real pleasure. Return at night to enjoy the effect of the water mirror in perfectly reflecting the lighted buildings, the trams and the people passing by. There are many",
          "Picture taking is best at night, and so the timing has to be good. We went just after 9, and my husbands picture is wonderful- like the books",
          "This 18th Century structure is imposing and finally opened up the city beyond the narrow confines of the old medieval walls.",

          "As it was windy and very crowded when we were there, there were not a lot of photo shot opportunities with the building in the mirror possible. My experience were therefor disappointing. I can imagine that it might be better in the nighttime or early in the morning when there",

          "Learn how to use your camera's panoramic mode for this area! It is very majestic and the water feature facing it across the road also enhances the area. There are lovely lanterns everywhere and many bars and restaurants can be found by taking any of the roads between the",

          "With the water in front, you can get nice pictures. The water is just a thin layer, and some of us did ride with the bike through the water, which gave a nice shot. I do not think it is good to do, because others want to take a picture with the water as still as possible. As it",

          "We walked the plaza and took photos, very nice to see. At night they light this up with the city, very cool.",
          "The view may have been better but it was crowded with people standing in the water so it did not reflect anything.",
          "We spent a few days in the beautiful city of Bordeaux. Most of the main sites are within walking distance, but our most memorable time was here at Place de la Bourse, where we joined with the crowds and paddled in the water of the mirror fountain, under the sunny skies. There",

          "This is one of the 'must see' Bordeaux attractions and if you manage to see it reflected in the water mirror then it makes the perfect photo. Chances of that however are very slim as the water attracts the crowds especially on a hot day.",
          "This is a very pretty square, but don't expect it to look like the tourist information pictures. There's lots of traffic between the water mirror and the buildings. This is a great place to go with kids and dogs when the weather is sunny.",
          "Must see when in Bordeaux. Very romantic and lively. There's a large water feature the kids can run and play in.",
          "The whole thing is very nice to look at and after you cross the road, you have a magnificent promenade with the Water Mirror and pretty gardens overlooking the river. What's not to like?",
          "Bordeaux is a young fun city and it was lovely to see all the children enjoying the water feature. It was great to sit in the square and watch the world go by in the evening",
          "I love it here... There are a lot of restaurants around here. I also loved the early morning market by the river. Nice place for a little walk after a big dinner with your love ones.",
          "We spent the first night of our holiday inn the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux facing the opera on the other side of the square. It was a beautiful summer evening and the square provided a very good mood for all. Jeremy Dupuoy was playing guitar and singing great songs - all quite good",
          "A broad expanse of architecture developed from 1730-1755 by the architects Gabriel...father and sons. The buildings form a semi circle around a large square, and face the Garonne river. Collonades, fountains, and the old hotel des Fermes in the southern part, and the palais de",

          "When you stand with your back to the river and look over the water mirror you just gasp at the immense beauty and size of the Palace. Give me a bottle of Medoc Cab Merlot and I could sit there watching the world go by from here for a long time. A can't miss attraction.",
          "Loved the trams. Made travelling from Le Gare to the city to simple. We did this at least once a day if not more and it was very reasonable priced",
          "This forms the centre point for the city of Bordeaux with the river Garonne on one side, flanked by the Water Mirror (which for some odd reason is listed as a separate attraction on TripAdvisor, when it is really a part of this). The classic architecture on display in this",

          "I have never seen anything like this before in my life, a reflective/mirror pool in front of a palace! My friend and I happened to visit on Bastille day so as you can imagine, there are loads of locals and tourists in the area. It was a lot of fun watching kids and even adults",
          "Readily viewed on a walk up the river. The architecture is stunning, as is the whole waterfront. The place was clean and not to busy when we were there. (Early on Bastille day). There's no good reason not to visit...",
          "Gorgeous setting especially in the evening. We happened to be there at around 2200 when the lights came on and everyone said 'ahh' as the lights twinkled and reflected in the water mirror. Lovely and can't miss this on your trip to Bordeaux.",

          "This is the attractive heart of the river waterfront. There are many good wide (establishing) photo-ops (especially w/ panorama); and there is an attractive, figured fountain in the center, (It is on a tram stop, which is a great cheap way to get around the city!)",

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:\n\n\n=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===\nSince 1947, there have been 5 mayors of Bordeaux:\n\nRPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to Les Republicains in 2015\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).\nThe University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\n\nThe University Bordeaux 1, (Maths, Physical sciences and Technologies), 10,693 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Segalen (Medicine and Life sciences), 15,038 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 3, Michel de Montaigne (Liberal Arts, Humanities, Languages, History), 14,785 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 4, Montesquieu (Law, Economy and Management), 12,556 students in 2002\nInstitut of Political Sciences of Bordeaux.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\nTour Pey-Berland (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux. It was built in the early 6th century on the site of a palaeochristian necropolis. It has an 11th-century portico, while the apse and transept are from the following century. The 13th-century nave has chapels from the 11th and the 14th centuries.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "Overview This beautiful 17th century church is one of Bordeaux's main attractions. Suggested Duration:2-3 hours Address:\nPlace Pey Berland, 33000, Bordeaux FranceMap ",
          "This magnificent building dates to the 11th century, but it has been partly rebuilt a few times since. It has a very long history and features prominently throughout Bordeaux's chequered story. It has been built in a beautiful architectural style and it is beautiful both inside",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful building inside and out, but before entering it is worth seeing it from the outside. A pleasant short walk will take you all the way round it. Inside of the cathedral is similar to many cathedrals, high and lofty with plenty of stained glass windows",
          "Lovely old cathedral. Well worth a visit to see the stunning organs. Beautiful setting. Could spend an hour wandering through the halls.",
          "We visited this 1096\u2019s cathedral during our morning old city walk with our tour. We went in for a little prayer, pictures without were allowed. There was a plaque on the outside wall about the history as well as the blueprint of the structure",
          "Eleanor of Aquitaine was married in this church at age 13. St. Andre's is beautiful, and retains an ancient grandeur. We had tried to visit mid-day but it was closed, came back at twilight and it was open and the light was gorgeous, and there were no tour groups. Try to come on",
          "As you approach the church it appears very exotic. On entering, it was simply beautiful. Notre Dame in Paris is larger but my husband and I like the interior of Andre more as the interior design is very exotic.",
          "We came here in the summer and visited the cathedral then. We return for Christmas and attended the Christmas service. So much to see in this beautiful cathedral. At night it is lit up and you can sit in peace in the square just admiring it.",
          "One of the most beautiful Cathedrals I've ever seen. It's not Notre Dame as Bordeaux is not Paris, but it is really great . I admired very beautiful vitrages and statues.",
          "We always look for a cathedral when in a new city. Bordeaux has one! It is far from the best we have ever seen, but it is still a decent one, The setting is a little \"tight\" in a city where the downtown is very packed--densely. That makes getting a good \"total view\" of the",
          "This is not the most beautiful cathedral I've been to, but still worth coming to. The place is decorated with beautiful statues, and has beautiful colored glass windows.",
          "Nice place. The grandiose cath\u00e9drale that is partofr France History. Still a lot to do for restauration",
          "While visiting Bordeaux recently we decided to finally enter the cathedral St-Andre on our second visit to the city. We were not disappointed at all. It was grandiose and majestic but not overly done lie so many other churches we have been so far in Europe. It well worth the",
          "We had been searching for, The Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9, a Unesco World Heritage Site. We had seen the gold statue on top of the belfry from the ship and had been searching for what was below it. The cathedral\u2019s oldest section dates from 1096, but most of structure was built in the",
          "Interesting that this church is almost 900 years old and it is standing in the same condition as hundreds of years before our time. My French friend you are really lucky to have such a treasure.",
          "Built around 1100AD it is a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE. It is massive 124 meters long.The Cathedral is the home of the Bishop. Many treasures inside to see. Nearby is the University of Bordeaux.",
          "1,000 years old, this gorgeous church boasts so much history. Jaw dropping architecture is all around you. It is so peaceful here. A must see when in Bordeaux! Read upon the history before arriving.",
          "The Cathedral and surrounding area very welcoming. There are several places to eat shop and drink. Not a fan of the homeless with their dogs that leave presents on the walkway though. Enjoy but watch your step",
          "This is a typical Gothic church - with some interesting features - an ancient clock and some major art works. We were very lucky when we visited - the local choir was rehearsing for a concert - Palestrina's Mass for 6 voices - just FAB and the acoustics were great. Pay a visit",
          "Anyone with interest in Eleanor of Aquitaine will love to visit this cathedral to see where she married the King of France, before marrying Henry II, King of England. Huge and very impressive cathedral - very easy to walk to from many parts of the city. Well worth a visit.",
          "The St. Andre Cathedral is a very interesting place to visit. The outside is beautiful and the insite is a mazing. Take enough time for the visit!",
          "I love cathedrals and this one is huge. It's well worth a visit. Lots of small chapels and a beautiful clock.",
          "The cathedral is well worth a visit, the outside is as interesting as the inside. There is lots to see and areas of prayer. Lots of history but unfortunately unless you can read french there is nothing in English unless you go as part of a tour.",
          "Beautiful outside, but she. You enter by the North door it seems much smaller. This is not a cavernous church rather a realistic scale for worship. Amazing to think Eleanor got married to the French king here, although ma y changes since then . The highlights for me are the",
          "One of the better maintained Cathedrals we have seen...paintings inside were stunning, and very large. You are able to walk around the entire Cathedral, which was nice.",
          "Every city in France has its cathedral, and this is Bordeaux's. Like all of them, it is a magnificent work of architecture, augmented by a lovely free-standing bell tower. Inside the structure there is the usual stained-glass windows and religious artefacts. It would be helpful",
          "Tower impressive. Magical light shines in from multiple stained glass windows. Ceilings so high I understand why the early Christians felt they could almost touch heaven.",
          "Unfortunately we only got to see the cathedral from the exterior as the church was not open during morning / early afternoon hours. Hence we are only able to discuss the outside of St. Andre, which definitely holds its own... A pity, would have loved to see the inside as well.",
          "Attended a sung mass in french which was absolutely beautiful. It\u2019s sad to see a half empty cathedral on a Sunday.",
          "Went here with my wife for Sunday Mass. We were seated quite near the front, the choir were fantastic and the service was as expected from a Catholic Church. The only thing that spoilt it was the visitors who entered, despite notices saying 'no visitors during services' who then",
          "We actually happened to walk by around the time mass was starting. Not being particularly religious we still chose to stay. So glad we did as it is certainly any experience. Whilst we don\u2019t speak French it was still a moving experience. The church architecture is amazing. The",
          "Even is late and it is closed, try to get there becouse is situated in a beatifull place and is a perfect building with a stunning allure. Is elegant and also in the night is looking like a page from an romantic mediaval story palace. Admire it , admire all the area.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral. We could see it from our hotel room. We enjoyed eating near the cathedral and enjoyed its beauty.",
          "Another beautiful cathedral. Unfortunately very little explanations in English. Worth a visit due to its beauty.",
          "Only visited the outside of this building. We were amazed at how stunning the cathedral was. The cathedral was set in a lovely square and there were a plethora of cafes that you could sit and admire the intricate stonemason work on the cathedral.",
          "Entry is free and there is a spiritual atmosphere here in spite of the many visitors. Big enough to wander round or sit and look around you.",
          "The cathedral is more impressive outside than in. The stained glass windows are beautiful but the rest of the inside is quite average.",
          "if you are in the area, do go inside and try to go up. we didnt go, as my daughter was too tired, it is our only regret.",
          "So beautiful and just plain huge. We did not go up in the tower but loved walking around inside and outside.",
          "What an incredible church! There is beauty no matter where you look. I was inspired to just sit there and draw. Sculptures, stained glass, gothic architecture... both inside and outside. The place lifts the soul, for believers as well as non-believers. It points to what",
          "Worth a visit usual cathedral atmosphere no charge for entry and easy to find - the associated bell tower is good but had long queues for the 200+ steps to the top",
          "Don't let my title mislead you. If you are visiting Bordeaux, I would recommend a visit to St. Andre. It ticks all of the boxes for a gothic cathedral, and if you haven't visited many churches of this era you will be impressed, especially with the beautiful double-towered",
          "We were here as tourists, but this church was filling up with people going to a wedding. The internal wood carvings are amazing, as are the stained glass windows.",
          "The cathedral is huge inside, and light with many lovely windows. There are painted pillars, a statue of Jean d'Arc and many other historical scenes. It is amazing that it was begin in the 11th century.",
          "Yet another gothic cathedral in France and just as beautiful as the others we have seen on this latest holiday. You enter this from the side. Not done that before. Two very tall spires. A separate bell tower (with story). A separate entrance was discovered last century and they",
          "If this was your first ever stop at a European city and had not seen any cathedrals yet, this place is well worth a look. It is very typical of cathedrals of it's day. The flying buttresses, gargoyles, etc, etc. On the other hand, there is nothing particular that stands out here",
          "Bordeaux's cathedral is massive Gothic pile, very reminiscent to us of many other Gothic churches we visited around France and Spain. But there was also plenty more about St Andre's to ensure we did not succumb to 'cathedral overload' here. Its towering spires, highly decorated",
          "This is one of the really huge cathedrals in France and one of the very old ones. The outside is almost finished with an enormous cleaning so most of the exterior is brigh clean sandstone. Really beautiful. Inside you can admire their nice stained glass windows. The paintings",
          "Beautiful historic cathedral if you enjoy seeing churches! Check the opening hours before going! Very easy to get to, also right beside the ancient Tower that you can climb.",
          "The Cathedral is beautiful and peaceful. The exterior of the building has great detail that is reminiscent of a smaller Notre Dame. Inside has gold foiled gates, wonderful sculptures, great arches and smaller more private worship areas. Just in front of the cathedral is a",
          "Stunning structure with a spindle thread spire. Very old church, preserved beautifully. Off the beaten track abs still in use for services. If you search churches to view, this is the one in Bordeaux.",
          "Fabulous cathedral and bell tower. It is very beautiful inside and out. Wonderful courtyard cafes to stop at after and enjoy the view. The cathedral is open to visitors for free.",
          "You can tell from the richness of this cathedral that Bordeaux has a rich history. I guess the wine business has always been lucrative. Worth a visit.",
          "On a recent trip to Bordeaux I visited this Cathedral and it was beautiful. Despite undergoing maintenance at the time (July 2019). Most of it had been recently cleaned on the outside as it is of a pale stone colour which I assume gets very dirty over the years. There was",
          "The Cathedral in which Leonore of Aquitaine and Louis VIII were married, was built at the end of the XI th century. New parts have been added after this date, but it stands out among the many buildings of the beautiful city of Bordeaux, UNESCO heritage . The entrance is free,",
          "St Andre Cathedral and Bell Tower is an imposing example of a medieval structure that is striking even with the ongoing renovation. Worth a visit to appreciate this historic symbol of medieval Bordeaux.",
          "A lovely old church with a fascinating history, the church is a central attraction in Bordeaux. We happened in while a church service was underway, and the gorgeous organ added greatly to the experience.",
          "The marriage of Eleanor de Acquitaine at this church may not the beginning of a romantic story but definitely the beginning of a great history. To get protection from France after she became the Duchess of Acquitaine, Eleanor married to the youngest son of the King of France at",
          "Beautiful Cathedral in the convenient part of Bordeaux. Worth a look and very inexpensive to view. Wonderfully done inside that is welcoming and authentic. It takes less than an hour to view. Worth seeing",
          "This is a very beautiful church with a fascinating history and well worth taking the time to visit if you have time.",
          "A must visit place of any walking city tour! Next to the Hotel de Ville, there are several nice cafes/restaurants to rest and/or eat depending on the time you come to the area...",
          "If you\u2019re only going to visit one historic site or religious site in Bordeaux, this should be it. St. Andre is enormous , very interesting and historically significant.",
          "A wonderful visit to a beautiful example of French Gothic sacred architecture. An unusual detail about St Andre Cathedral is its free standing bell tower.",
          "I recently visited this Cathedral and I must say it is stunning inside. The outside is going through a lot of renovation but don\u2019t let this put you off it excellent for a quiet walk around inside.",
          "This is not one of the great cathedrals of France and it is architecturally a big of a mixed bag, but the interior is impressive and it is the site (if not the actual building) where Eleanor of Aquitaine married her first husband, Louis VII, king of France. It is certainly",
          "The stone carvings outside and around the doors were superb. I am still wondering about the 12 disciples, one of whom had another's head under his arm! It is in the process of being cleaned so they were set off to great advantage. The stained glass windows were stunning. The",
          "Started life in the 11th century, and there is a lot of history here. Not really into churches but this is really special. Large stone arches make you wonder at the skills involved, and the stained glass windows are large and gorgeous. Well worth a visit and a wander inside.",
          "What I enjoyed most were the side altars that arc around the main altar. They are ornate and honor various saints. One was restricted for prayer - non-believers are requested to not enter. It is enormous in size and has an impressive organ - wish I had been there when it was",
          "Commanding Cathedral with impressive spires - stately and beautiful building in open Square. Tours available of the Bell Tower.",
          "This church is my favorite in Bordeaux! The interior is stunning. It's a quiet place to sit for awhile, and there is always beautiful Gregorian music playing Check out the concerts they offer!",
          "It\u2019s imposing and architecturally interesting. Looks well and has aged nicely. Worth dropping in and enjoying the peaceful-interior.",
          "Nice, not spectacular. Worth a visit (free). Nothing really specialabout it. The flying buttreses are unique, I do recomend climbing the bell tower, which is seperate costs 6 euro. Great view and good history. Would not recomend bell tower to claustraphobic or the larger person,",
          "The cathedral is centrally located and within easy walking distance from many parts of the town. It is a huge building - deceptive since you enter from the side. Beautiful stained glass windows to admire once you are inside",
          "Beautiful old Cathedral is well maintained. It reminds you of Norte Dame de Paris. Must visit in Bordeaux",
          "Some parts of the exterior are being renovated but happily the front entrance & some side parts can still be seen.",
          "It is a wonderful building, with lots of history hidden inside. It presents nicely both from outside and inside. It is a must to see in the city. Thanks to central location you can be sure, you will not miss it while walking around the city.",
          "Beautiful church with old gothic architecture. Inside a little bit sad, missing the happy colors other may have but a must see",
          "Lovely old church with a rose window and a very old clock can get quite busy with visitors but worth entering to savour the atmosphere and they have brochures printed in several languages.",
          "We knew little about Eleanor of Aquitaine before we came to Bordeaux but this was where she had married in the twelfth century. To see the amazing exterior and interior was a privilege.",
          "Beautiful architecture and interior. A good area to explore. The exterior stones are being cleaned to show the original appearance.",
          "A wonderful cathedral with a very nice statue of madona inside. The entrance is free. I recommend going around and look at missing part on the side (because of town wals in period of building this cathedral).",
          "Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Andr\u00e9 on Place Pey Borland in front of Hotel de Ville in Bordeaux is a large and externally impressive gothic cathedral. Inside it is nice but for a Catholic church of this size, somewhat austere. From the outside, the sheer scale of the place is impressive.",
          "The squair before the Cathedral isn't very large, so it is very difficult to make a good photo of the compete huge building, The stand alone tower just beside the Cathedral is also an impressive building, we recommend a visit to this place.",
          "Lovely exterior architecture. Beautiful windows. Not as large as expected inside, but vast height to the ceiling.",
          "One of the main atraction of the city, this beautiful gothic cathedral gain her place on the priorities of the travelers list ! They have free guides in italian, french, english and spanish. The statues keep the traces of the french revolution ( they was painted in blue, white",
          "I went to visit this cathedral Saturday early in the morning and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not busy at all. I just walked straight in and was able to walk around and take pictures with no fuss and huge amounts of people around. Great beautiful architecture",
          "Wherever and whenever my wife and I go away we have to call into the local church for my wife to light a candle and say a little prayer for the family. St Andrews in Bordeaux is less ornate than some cathedrals but has a nice calm atmosphere especially as it sits in the centre",
          "A great place to spend some time enjoying the peace of this welcoming church in this busy/bustling city. The history and architecture is very medieval not having all the embellishments of the more prominent cathedrals. It has a sense of solidity.",
          "The cathedral is enormous, especially from the outside,an absolute beautiful sight and a well known land mark. check the opening times as we went and it was shut even though it should have been open, passed by later in the day and it was then open",

          "An absolute beautiful sight and a well known land mark. The restaurants really up their prices being in visual distance of the cathedral.",
          "Despite the rain and the ongoing roof repairs, the cathedral is a handsome edifice with vast amounts of history in its being. Its towers and neighbouring bell tower are graceful and offer endless photogenic angles.",
          "A must see when in Bordeaux - it\u2019s architecture as beautiful at night (outside) as it is by day. Lovely buzzy part of town to stop off at in the evening for a bite/ drink.",
          "I\u2019ve had the privelage of seeing many of Europes big cathedrals, what is impressive about this one is that it is not gilt. The inside reflects the raw nature of time and natural stone. The ogives are amazing in how they ornament the ceiling.",
          "This lovely cathedral is amazing outside as well as in. The architecture is impressive outside, and the decoration and design inside this structure has been well-preserved.",
          "It was quite a walk from our river boat. I enjoyed the tour through Bordeaux along the way. Looked online afterwards to find out more of what I had seen. Wish I did that first or had a good tour guide. Fascinating building both outside and in.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral worth the visit to talk with God. If he is not there at the time there are usually a lot of other people with whom you can share your thoughts. A beautiful place of reflection",

          "Just a quick drop by. Easy to travel by tram. Buy 3 days tram ticket and enjoy the trip in Bordeaux. Hop in hop off anywhere the whole day",
          "One of the highlights of the city this cathedral is definitively worth a visit. It is not overly spectacular and we were in and out in about 45 minutes.",
          "A beautiful church; watch out for disrespectful and ignorant tourists taking photos. It is a place of worship.",
          "Lovely cathedral with lovely stained glass windows. It is a big one and lots to see. There is lots of great statues in here to see as well.",
          "This historical Catholic Cathedral dedicated to saint Andrew is a very remarkable building and holy place.",
          "I've seen quite a number of Cathedrals in France, I can say that it was mostly the structure but thw uniqueness in this Cathedral was the tower bell is separated from the Cathedral. It was said that to avoid vibrations of the bells it must be separated from the Cathedral.",
          "Currently stone work being cleaned after which it will look stunning. Amazing carvings all over cathedral,especially the door..",
          "This is a lovely cathedral, interesting to history buffs because it is where the greatest heiress of the time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, married Louis VII of France. Not much of that medieval church remains but its current incarnation is very beautiful. The stained glass windows",
          "What a place! Enormous with some beautiful art and well, the architecture was just mind blowing. Awesome!",
          "This beautiful old cathedral, a short walking distance from the Place de la Bourse, is a highlight of the old city of Bordeaux, and you should not miss it. Great architecture, majestic setting and nice mosaics and stained-glass windows.",
          "This cathedral is impressive and is well worth a visit inside. There was maintenance underway when visited but it did nothing t restrict our visit",
          "A lot of work is being done to restore the cathedral. It is a lovely soft, creamy colour and has beautiful stained glass windows. There is enough to see to pass a pleasant hour before going out into the square for a coffee or something stronger.",
          "If you're not \"cathedraled-out\" on your European trip, this typical cathedral is a great example; and there are some very nice carved details and stained glass.",
          "Other beautiful cathedral on France as usual. The square in fronteira is pleasant with dozens of cafes. Nice place to spend a time.",
          "This is an interesting cathedral to see. It is not too far from the city centre and all the shops are on the way!",
          "This is an interesting catherdral and worth seeing if you are in Bordeaux. IT is better to see it during the day.",
          "Attended a long service of Ordination, cathedral packed but not uncomfortable if seated. Singing and organ top notch- a building which reminds of the social function of these cathedrals which were built as community spaces and come alive when used like this.",
          "If you only have time to visit one church in Bordeaux, this is the one. It is very centrally located. The exterior is beautiful with large Gothic carvings. There is a rose window above the main entrance. Inside there are lots of interesting and attractive religious paintings and",
          "A beautiful old cathedral with great stained glass and a magnificent organ. Got there just at the end of mass, so I was able to hear the postlude on the organ; what a treat. While it won't take an hour to see the place, it should be a required stop on anyone's list of places",
          "This is an old cathedral interesting due to its history, but needs an update in its structure inside and out.",
          "Outside is incredible, the cathedral is impressive in size and the intricacy of its decor. Inside is also a spectacle to see, with huge oil paintings on the walls, stained glass windows and beautiful and high ceiling. Plus it's free - worth a visit",
          "This is a really beautiful building - great for photo opportunities. Beware the rip off drinks prices in the nearby cafes though!",
          "This cathedral is best summed up in one word: magnificent. Outside you will notice the grand structure of interesting architecture. Inside is quite spectacular. The ceilings are amazing works of art. It is massive. Every afternoon at 2 PM they open the Cathedral for public",
          "For me, the most impressive cathedral in Bordeaux. Although it is under reconstruction, visit is not affected by it. Visit inside the church and also go up the bell tower (hard work, but beautiful). And inside the church, pay attention to the organ. it is impressive!!!",
          "This cathedral is quite beautiful and full of history. A must see in Bordeaux. Elinor of Aquitaine was married here. When she married Henry II of England Aquitaine was given to England and England made Bordeaux rich and famous",
          "Cathedrals are always worth visiting. In France they have grandeur and splendour in abundance. St Andrew's in Bordeaux is at the top of the pile in my view; it's historical role on the pilgrimage to Santiago coupled with the outstanding renovation work currently underway. We",
          "This is not a destination in itself e.g., Notre Dame in Paris, but rather a place for a worthwhile walk through with intriguing architectural features. Its location along a pathway of Bordeaux's more interesting sights makes it a worthwhile stop, particularly since the facade",
          "The twin spires,the wonderful stained glass windows, the great organ create a wonderful atmosphere. Definitely a must if you are in Bordeaux",
          "spent a lovely hour looking around the cathedral - couldnt look at all of it as there was a confirmation rehearsal in progress but thats no problem - just means i'll have to look at the rest next year i did have a couple of issues though from a tourist side it would have been",
          "Bordeaux is not short of impressive churches but Cathedrale St.Andre is certainly amongst the very best. Externally, its imposing size and height dominates the broad square in which it sits and the beautiful ornamentation on the honey-coloured spires please the eye. Internally,",
          "This cathedral is definitely worth a visit being situated in the centre of Bordeaux next door to the Town Hall. Magnificent inside with beautiful stain glass windows and soaring columns. This was visited by Pope Urban in 1096 so is an amazing feat of architecture!",
          "A magnificent structure with much external detail and some excellent examples of Flying Buttresses. The separate bell tower is interesting, designed not to disturb the foundations of the Cathedral. We were limited to an external visit only due the Cathedral being used for it's",
          "This one of the must sees when visiting Bordeaux.Stunning Cathedral both inside and out.The artwork and craftsmanship are incredible.",
          "A small catherdral. Nice ornate cravings inside and out. Very peaceful. Free entry. Worth a visit. Imposing from the outside and forms Bordeaux's skyline.",
          "You\u00a1l like this if you're into this sort of stuff. Opening hours are kinda weird, 10-12 and 13-18 I believe",
          "the st andre cathedral is pretty looks if you want to do a very touristy thing in bordeaux. but this attraction isnt guided with a tour or known people to explain the history. it can surely be missed if you want to miss it. the pictures only come out good in the day time,",
          "Another Cathedral, they begin to merge into one another but with sympathetic reconstruction and it's settiing in the centre of a fine square makes it a very impressive building. There are plenty of information boards in English and you get a real feel for how worshippers must",
          "Would have been better if there are guided tours to go with it. Very beautiful inside. Surprisingly, it was not so lit in the night which would have made it even nicer.",
          "Visiting the cathedral is free, but the bell tower has a modest fee. It was closed all three times we attempted to go up it. Worth a visit.",
          "Next to the townhall and at Hotel de Ville station you can find this amazing cathedral. It's by far the most beautiful of all of Bordeaux's great churches. We enjoyed the walk around the church and premises, but would have loved any information in English about history and",
          "We've visited the Cathedrale St Andre a few times. It's a starting place for us in Bordeaux when we have friends & family visiting. We're not overly religious but visiting the church/cathedral in any town or city is one of those touristy things that we tend to do. In the case",
          "When we visited - the cathedral was not open to the public. There was plenty of restoration work being down at one end of it. Fortunately, there were some signs explaining a little of the cathedral. We later sat a a coffee shop across the street and enjoyed the bell as it",
          "A place to visit if it rains. It is vast but the windows were of the old fashioned stained glass type and must confess it is not as stunning as many of the other cathedrals in France",
          "In 1804 Washington Irving puts in Travel Diaries this: \u201cI spent a very pleasant afternoon visiting and admiring one of the best examples of Gothic art in France, the Cathedral of St. Andre\u201d. What was true for him, is more than true for us: the cathedral is remarkably beautiful.",
          "The Cathedral is large and opposing having been added to through the years. Having taken in the bus tour we learned that several French monarchs have married here. There wasn't much available in English, but this didn't spoil our visit. There are candles for sale and small gift",
          "Saint Catherine's is a beautiful gothic like cathedral in the centre of the old town of Bordeaux. Outside is beautiful. The inside has some great large paintings and a huge organ. Entry is free so I would recommend a visit.",
          "Cathedral is not huge, but it is well restored and definitely worth a visit.Set in a large square across from City Hall.",
          "The cathedral is undergoing renovation but this is mainly exterior. It is an icon of the city and has an interesting history. Well worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful architecture with good stained glass, and a fine setting in the square near Hotel de Ville. The golden figure atop the spire is a fantastic landmark. The lower part of the nave has wonderful 'white' light from the clear glass windows.",
          "Part of the unesco walking tour I mentioned before this church is a gem. Grand, well kept, central. They play gospel music inside which creates a nice atmosphere. It's free to enter and the rosary windows are a sight to see. There's a tower next to it that provides a fantastic",
          "Very nice stained glass. Unusual form, with the north door having the twin towers and rose window. The royal portal just west of it is also interesting.",
          "The first time we tried to get in the cathedral was closed, despite the posted hours, as was the tower. The tower is free with the City Pass.",
          "Well worth a visit, if only for the soaring vaulted roof. Look out for the windows along the side of the nave giving onto the roman era foundations.",
          "Same as other? There seem to be two TA attractions with the same name. No feeling - no atmosphere, but I guess it's a must see if you are in the city? 1754.",
          "On the organ that is. Imposing Gothic Cathedral but lacking in intimacy. Astronomical clock is quite high up on the wall near the entrance. 1753",
          "This is free and a spectacular cathedral. One of the best sites in Bordeaux its so beautiful. Go see it.",
          "Inside and outside are marvelous. It's free to go in,but suggested to leave a donation. it's a really impressive building.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral with a very impressive pipe organ. It's absolutely worth a visit, and it's close to several tram stops.",
          "The Cathedral is an easy and short walk from the Ibis Budget. The stained glass and rose windows are magnificent; the organ is wonderful - I wish I could have heard it.",
          "This magnificent cathedral is a don't miss stop on your tour of Bordeaux. Currently in the process of renovation and cleaning it still reflects the age of greatness",
          "Not many historical land marks around a city are for free but this one certainly is. Wonder inside and marvel at the gothic architecture. Photographic tip of the day is as follows - the cathedral is very dark inside, dependant on the positioning of the outside sun you may notice",
          "We enjoyed going to the Cathedral. Fantastic to walk around inside and outside. Lovely square to have a cold drink or lunch afterwards too.",
          "This is such a beautiful building both inside and out. They are nearly finished cleaning the stone on the outside. The interior is simply stunning and very light. So many interesting and very large paintings on the walls. We went in a couple of times on our short visit and",
          "This is a huge gothic cathedral.Got some lovely pictures here.It is close by to lots of bars and restaurants.In a lovely setting.",
          "This is a really historic and beautiful place to visit. The exterior is definitely in need of some maintenance with the staining of the limestone especially on the one side but the inside is grand. There was a young boy playing the violin during our visit inside the alter area",
          "Two of the three tram lines stop right outside the cathedral so you can't really miss it. What a truly spectacular building. The architecture is stunning. Note the buttresses outside that help support the structure. Inside the place is a feast for the eyes. The carvings are",
          "This is one of the must see sights of Bordeaux. The interior is a huge glorious Gothic space - and with wonderful quality of light. The carvings, with a fascinating mix of pagan and Christian depictions merit close scrutiny. There is an amazing alabaster statue of an early",
          "Nice cathedral visited with Pey-Berland tower next to it. A little walk from city center but the tower is well worth it.",
          "Came here when I visited my friend and it was a beautiful place to visit. Had such a lovely experience it was so peaceful.",
          "I found the outside awesome but the inside a little disappointing. The surrounding area is lovely and well worth a visit. If your hotel is nearby as ours is it is a good focal point.",
          "Enjoyed this cathedral. Lovely location in a beautiful city. Beautiful architecture. Really enjoyed all the detail, the spires, the buttresses, the towers, the rosette window, the gothic interior with old astronomical clock and some bits of arabic influence. Wish I would",
          "on a sunny day this is the place to be, with all the cafe's around and the Mari de ville next door the sun shone all day with lovely drinks and a lunchtime meal it was extremely good day",
          "Right in the centre of town, on the recently built tram line,this is a great place to see both a beautiful medieval building but then to also take in the more sybaraitic sights of the city while enjoying a glass of Lillet the local aperitif.",
          "This is a big and impressive cathedral with many flying buttresses outside - built when the roof started to collapse. At the moment it is being extensively cleaned outside. It was extremely cold inside and we were pleased that we weren't at a service! There are some",
          "Nice walk near the river end of the day with great buildings to photo, recommend the passage to take some photos",
          "The Cathedral and Tour Pey Borland (bell tower) dominate Place Pey-Borland. The Cathedral has stunning stunning southern Gothic architecture with its Royal doorway built in the 13th century, its enormous organ and choir. The Cathedral is currently undergoing exterior",
          "Don;t rush to go in ... there are far more beautiful churches in Bordeax...look for Notre Dame in particular.",
          "We visited St Andre Cathedral and it was beautiful. We were fortunate that there happenend to be a choir singing and we stood at the back of the Catherdral in all its splendour soaking in the beauty and listening to the wonderful music. The Cathedral is situated in a beautiful",
          "If you are into architecture or photography, this would be a must do in bordeaux. A short walk from the main promenade, this is a giant building and you can see the top from most places in the city. from the inside it is like any European cathedral. for the outside you may have",
          "The scaffolding is nearly down & the outside has been cleaned. An impressive cathedral (one of several in Bordeaux).",
          "I have been in several cathedrals and definitely these were the most impressive stained glass. It was incredible. Moreover I would like to advice to visit on a sunny day in order to see how the light reflects on the windows",
          "Still being cleaned, so scaffolding on part of the outside but super inside. An exhibition on Coptic Egyptian Christianity was superb",
          "This is a very beautiful cathedral and highly recommended place to visit. It is free entrance or you can just donate any money. Must visit when in Bordeaux.",
          "St.Andrew chapel is under renovation and part of chapel has been completed. Tower of mother Mary with infant Jesus next St.Andrews chapel is very beautiful.",
          "This is a very impressive Cathedral and worth taking the time the visit if churches or history are of interest to you.",
          "France is full of impressive church's and this is one of them, it makes a striking feature in the city and is easy walking distance from other important tourist sites.",
          "What amazing Gothic architecture. With gargoyles, spikes and peaked steeples. Unfortunately I could not go inside as I was closed.",
          "Lovely gothic cathedral, and not crowded with disrespectful tourists. If you love gothic architecture and sacred art, this is definitely worth your time!",
          "It is hence a mix or Roman simple architecture and Gothic more elaborate and refined style. Beautiful tainted glass. Nice spacious square outside with a huge xmas tree (end of November) and elegant nearby town hall.",
          "St Andre Cathedral is interesting both from a religious as well as an architectural point of view. The clerical authorities have gone to great length to explain what the Cathedral is about and some of the basic Christian beliefs. The actual building is an interesting mix of",
          "Lovely cathedral centrally located with a separate bell tower outside. Climb the bell tower for a great view of the cathedral from above. The climb in the tower is narrow and gets even narrower at the top.",
          "Historic Gothic Cathedral. The most interesting were the stained glass windows. Also, if you are lucky and it is open, with a logical fee you have the opportunity to climb up to the tower and to see the view. The Cathedral is surrounded by a very nice square with a lot of caf\u00e9s",
          "Located next to the City Hall, this beautiful edifice is lovely inside and out. Take the tram one way and walk back through the neighborhoods and shopping streets of town.",
          "The cathedral was just steps away from where we were staying, so we had the chance to see the exterior of it numerous times before our interior visit. It is an imposing building, and parts of the stone structure were built in the 1100s. There are very impressive stained glass",
          "Loved this Cathedral both inside and outside. Gorgeous in every way. Outside is under some construction, but it does not take away from the beauty of the architecture. The square outside the Cathedral is a perfect stop to enjoy the sunshine and sip a drink!",
          "One of the most beautiful Cathedral in the southwest of France. One of the key characteristics is that the bell tower is not above the Cathedral but beside. Same thing with Saint Michel church. So, visiting the Cathedral and Peyberland tower is an absolute must",
          "Absolutely beautiful building whether interested in history or not! It is free to go inside also so it's a great opportunity. Just wonderful!",
          "Medieval Gothic architecture, magnificent rose window. Look up, it is heavenly. A must see. Put this one on your list.",
          "I'm not an expert on ecclesiastical architecture, but this cathedral is particularly interesting because the nave ceiling seems very high compared with the building's overall dimensions, and also because of the twin steeples and the additions that have been made over the years.",
          "Not the biggest cathedral in France but it's still very nice inside. Definitely a must see in bordeaux. It's near the city hall so you can't miss it. Closes early so be careful.",
          "St Andre may not have the wow factor of some of its sister European cathedrals but it is worth a visit to see the fabulous organ and sculptures. The arches underneath the organ have exquisite carvings from mythology and some beautiful freizes on the wall. There is a lovely",
          "We toured this cathedral twice. Once to capture the general layout and again to spend more time looking at the beautiful interior. Inside you will find beautiful art, many small chapels, and a large, working clock. Huge nave. A visitors desk is manned with volunteers to provide",
          "All you would expect from a french gothic cathedral. serene inside votive candles are availble from the sacristy rather than in the side chapels themselves",
          "My wife and I took a long walk around downtown towards the end of a business trip. She was shopping, I was just looking. We enjoyed visiting this cathedral",
          "This huge cathedral is unusual in that you enter from the side. I loved that there were stone carvers letting kids try their hand at stone cutting outside the main entrance. A service was happening and I loved the music echoing!",
          "Beautiful Gothic architecture.The Cathedral is surrounded by a huge pedestrian mall which includes two cafes with great views of the the cathedral.Great people watching as well!!",
          "Being restored so much scaffolding, hoarding and noise. Revealing honey coloured stonework this cathedral needs a lot of work. Outside beginning to look good; inside needs loads of work - black in places. Good central point.",
          "A must see, the Cathedral Saint-Andre is a beautiful building from the 14th and 15th centuries and a place of historic consequence.",
          "Lovely gothic cathedral. Currently undergoing renovations. The visit is free and usually requires at least an hour. The exterior is quite ornate, and you can access the Royal Door from the interior. The inside has great viewpoints of the ornate decor. Must visit when in",
          "What should have been the main entry to this lovely cathedral was just a large wooden door, as the wall it was set in was part of the original wall around the city. The other two doors on the side had beautiful carvings around them, and inside one could admire the stained",
          "Right in the city centre this Cathedral cannot be missed! Renovations happening at the moment so you can't fully view the outside but the architecture is impressive.",
          "This is a stop on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela (Spain) so look for the tablets in the sidewalk in front of the cathedral and get a stamp inside! Walk around the outside and take in the architecture. Be aware of the opening hours.",
          "This is a absolute must visit! Blessed by the Pope Urban II in 1096 it is absolutely stunning. your mouth will drop the moment you walk in the main doors. The bell tower beside the cathedral is equally as impressive.",
          "The Cathedral is certainly worth a visit while in Bordeaux, but it did not seem to me to be one of the country's more beautiful churches. The cathedral is being renovated and the beautiful cream brickwork is being exposed piece by piece. THe entrance wall has been cleaned and",
          "it was nice to visit this Cathedral as it was only a 5 min walk from the hotel, we arrived it was very busy around it with lots of people milling around we sat out side for about 30 mins watching the world go by with the stunning twin towers as our back drop. We decided to go",
          "On a city tour with a tourist bus, we had discovered the cathedral. It was so nice that we went back there for a drink on a terrace in front of the main entrance. It was another of those lovely moments shared with my wife in France.",
          "We did not go inside but from the outside this Cathedral is truly fantastic and a must see whilst in Bordeaux. The renovations are really well advanced making this church truly beautiful.",
          "If you are ok with the 233 spiral steps to the top of the bell tower then you'll be rewarded with incredible Gargoyles eye views of the city.",
          "Before I came to this city I forgot how many fine organs there are. If I had checked I would have been able to attend one that I missed it. This is my main regret. What a huge church organ it is and I'm sure it could do justice to the finest French organ traditions. The church",
          "Free to enjoy or donate. Interesting architecture and stained glass windows. More colour on the walls and columns than I have seen in other cathedrals. Very interesting. Seating outside to each your picnic in the square and watch and world go by.",
          "We only saw this from the outside at night , but just the lighting alone made the place look magnificent.",
          "We visited September 2016. It is being very slowly cleaned, some scaffolding, the results are lovely. Not too ostentatious inside. I found the engineering, making it stand upright, more interesting than anything else. Free, or donate.",
          "Beautiful, large and awe-inspiring - look out for remnants of the original paintwork on some of the columns.",
          "Exceptional Cathedral with great art and sculpture. The surrounding square was full of people and cafes were nearby to sit and watch the world go by.",
          "Flying buttresses outside, amazing soaring pointed arches and lovely ancient stained glass inside. Once inside heaven seems closer and possible.",
          "Located in the center of town, the St.Andre Cathedrale is a very fine example of construction and architecture from the 1300's. Today the Cathedral of the region, it has recently unearthed and opened the original North Doors. Surrounded by several Bistros it is a nice visit,",
          "A stunning symmetry of design and history not to be missed in Bordeaux ,away from the hustle and bustle of the City tranquility and peace awaits through the door way into St AndreCathedral. A truly beautiful Cathedral well worth your time.",

          "If you're in the area and like to visit churches and cathedrals, I would recommend a visit here It's free to enter but they accept optional donations which are not demanded or requested. You can light a selection of candles which are around \u20ac2 each for the large candles .. I",
          "Of course the cathedral is beautiful and huge but even better is the tower next to it! The climb is definitely worth it for the view on a clear day!",
          "Wonderful exterior and even better inside with multiple chapels, statues etc. Restricted opening hours so check beforehand. You don't need to be religious to appreciate the wonders of the building and the serenity of the place. 30 minutes or so spent in here will not be wasted.",
          "To see a structure like this built centuries ago is always a tribute to the many men and women who built it. The Cathedral history is very interesting going back to 1100 ad. Worth the visit and free!!",
          "Visited the cathedral on a 2 day visit to this beautiful city. Set beside the Hotel de Ville with the Cafe Francais in the place beside it makes for a perfect visit. The Cathedral is truly majestic. When we visited there was a string quartet playing music by Hayden which made",
          "This cathedral is located in the center and one of the best must to see in Bordeaux. It is currently under construction. But still good and you should see",
          "This is a beautiful looking building from the outside, but rather underwhelming inside. Worth a visit, though.",
          "this cathedral is one of the most magnificant churches i have seen in my time. it is full of interesting corners to see and is always busy. take note of the clock on the side wall. well worth a visit",
          "Best stain class windows in this Cathedral - would love to see it full - it must be some site and energy - surroundings spectacular - east access and near tramway",

          "take some time and have a look at the architecture on this cathedral - pictures will not pay it justice",
          "We don't know exactly why but we are very impressed with this cathedral. Perhaps it is because of the great atmosphere or because beautifully decorated interior with great clock inside of cathedral.",
          "If you are walking around Bordeaux, this is a nice stop. Beautiful Cathedral and located amongst other point of interest. There's currently some work (believe cleaning the outdoor stone) but it is only one a small part.",
          "This was a beautiful cathedral with stunning views from the top. It was quite a climb but worth it once you got to the top.",
          "Stunning cathedral in a beautiful location. The interior is stunning, when we visited Children's choir music was being piped and it really added to the ambience.",
          "A beautiful cathedral that had a very calming atmosphere. Overall beautiful and it was lovely having the option to purchase a candle to light.",
          "Well worth a visit a beautiful cathedral outside and inside spend a bit of time to do it justice excellent photo opportunities too",
          "Start out by taking in the spires. This is gorgeous gothic architecture. There is work currently underway to open up the royal access to the cathedral, but that is a minor annoyance unless you're looking for photos from that angle. Whether exterior views are what impress you or",
          "This cathedral is stunning. It has amazing carvings on the exterior and so much more to see on the interior. The Gothic architecture is stunning but there is also a warmth to the building which you don't always find in these imposing buildings. I particularly liked the",

It was in this theatre that the ballet La fille mal gard\u00e9e premiered in 1789, and where a young Marius Petipa staged some of his first ballets.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe theatre was designed by the architect Victor Louis (1731\u20131800). Louis later designed the galleries surrounding, the gardens of the Palais Royal, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais in Paris.\nThe Grand Theatre of Bordeaux was conceived as a temple of the Arts and Light, with a neo-classical facade.\nIt has a portico of 12 Corinthian style colossal columns which support an entablature on which stand 12 statues that represent the nine Muses and three goddesses (Juno, Venus and Minerva). \nPierre-Fran\u00e7ois Berruer made four of the statues, and his assistant Van den Drix carved the others from Berruer's models.The interior grand staircase served as a model for the grand staircase of the Op\u00e9ra Garnier in Paris.On the ceiling of the auditorium, there is a large fresco painted by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Robin. It pays homage to the Arts, to the artisans that built the building, and to the city of Bordeaux. The late scene shows a woman, allegory of Bordeaux, protected by Hermes and Athena, and in the foreground, three wealth of the city : the wine, the sea trade and the slave.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1871, the theatre was briefly the National Assembly for the French Parliament.\nThe inside of the theatre was restored in 1991, and once again has its original colours of blue and gold. The Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux is one of the oldest wooden frame opera houses in Europe not to have burnt or required rebuilding.\nToday, the theatre is home to the Op\u00e9ra National de Bordeaux, as well as the Ballet National de Bordeaux which has many international dancers.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLaurent Croizier, Luc Bourrousse (2011).

          "A short trip but I would recommend as the theater is dazzling to behold although the staff can be a little curt and cold to say the least hence why only a 3 star rating.",

          "I bought tickets online before I travelled to Bordeaux to a classical music performance on a Sunday morning in order to experience the inside of the theatre. It\u2019s beautiful.",
          "We wanted to see the interior and the only way to do that was in a tour. The only tour available was in French but we decided to go ahead anyway. The guide spent a lot of time describing the architecture and the significance of the statues and numbers of columns. He then started",
          "Wonderful piece of art, this monumental building in the centre of Bordeaux is a place not to miss. Visits allowed but, if possible, go and buy a ticket for any event. Breathtaking",
          "They do a tour here for a very reasonable price. Be aware, they only had a French language tour available when we were there. Still very pretty inside.",
          "It's a beautiful building but the tour (offered only in French) is very limited and did not allow access to the theatre proper.",
          "The theatre was very big and wide. it was great to see. for children under five the tour will be very boring but for tourists it's great.",
          "This really is a \"grand\" theater. It sits on 12 columns and 12 figures grace the top (3 of which are Minerva, Venus, and Juno/Hera who was the wife of Zeus). The other nine are muses. It was built in the 1780's in a neo-classical stye. A major restoration was undertaken in",
          "This was a complete rip off because they advertise a tour of the grand Theatre but since they had a rehearsal going on they had 20 of us look in through a window of glass. The lights were off in the theatre so you couldn\u2019t see a thing. I told them on the way out that they",
          "If you are lucky there might be a concert or opera being performed. If not take a tour. Stunning building inside and out. Look for the 12 statues on the top. These are the muses.",

          "It was evening when we arrived at the opera house and tours or admittance were not allowed unless you had a ticket to the performance. Great views of the building from the Intercontinental across the Place de la Comedie. At night the building looks grand, front fa\u00e7ade, is",
          "In mid-April, there were few tours and fewer in English, and you can't step more than 2 feet into the building to have a look. On the left side, there's a gorgeous opera cafe, probably a great lunch place for dining in grand style.",

          "The inside of the theatre is as lovely as the outside. It's quite small, but that means that most of the seats are quite good as you're able to see the stage quite well. The only issue might be if you're short (like me) and sitting further back in a balcony booth. It's an old",
          "When we decided to visit Bordeaux, we booked \"Don Quichotte\". This theatre is smaller than famous theatres, but \"Kitri\" on that night really pleased us. Also ticket prices are reasonable. Buy seats in front rows, unless you have a particular preference. The stage is really close",
          "This is a good visit of almost an hour with an excellent guide. The building is amazing all made of wood with a somptuous central staircase and spectacular natural lighting. Try to go to a show or spectacle, you will enjoy it more.",
          "Fantastic way to spend an hour or so. The architecture from outside is great but inside the gold gilding and ornate decoration everywhere you look is amazing. Informative guide and interesting listening to him. Liked the costumes as well and seeing backstage. Worth the entrance",

          "We hoped to see something at the Grand Theatre but unfortunately the dates we were in town didn't work for us Instead we took the tour, which gave us a glimpse into the theatre. Our guide was excellent, the time flew by Don't miss seeing this incredible architecture",
          "I took the tour knowing that the guidance will be in French and my own French skills are lousy. The building looked so interesting, that I wanted to see the interior. My French was enough to understand that there were interesting facts told, but not enough to truly understand",

          "My daughter and son-in-law took me along to this event. The interior of the Grand Theatre is simply spectacular! It's worth a visit even if there is no performance on going. If you are a large person (I'm 6'2\") be aware that the seating was designed for much smaller frames.",

          "I would say that it is a master piece by itself & by Night the lights on adds a new dimension to the fa\u00e7ade . The Theatre inside has beautiful chandeliers & the paintings on the roof to which the chandelier is beautiful. You have balconies like cubicle wherein 10-12 people can",
          "We were staying near here so saw it every day, such a beautiful building during the day and all lit up at night. We did go in to the foyer area to admire the columns, ceilings and statues. Would have loved to have a peek inside the main part of the building but nothing on when",

          "The theater was the best part of the performance as it is old fashioned, with movable seats in the dress circle, and very good acoustics resultant from both design and many of the Baroque style decorations. It is in need of renovation and updating nonetheless. Sadly, of all the",

          "Very beautiful structure in the middle of Bordeaux, with lots of locals and tourists sitting on the steps in front of the building. My wife & I didn't have a chance to go inside as we were only there for a short time and could not time our visit with a show, but think it will be",
          "As soon as I saw it reminded me othe ancient theaters. Moreover, the square in which is located is full of people and live. As many buildings on this city, the light at night makes this theatre special",

          "We were very lucky and were able to get tickets for La Boheme in the Grand Theater in Bordeaux. An extemely classical Theater with loges all around. The opera was superbly sung especially the 2 main parts - Mimi and Rodolpho. Worth a visit.",

          "I have to admit we didn't venture inside (mostly because we heard the tours were dull and the season of opera had ended) but the facade is beautiful and we marvelled at it several times per day when we walked past. I'd recommend making time for a drink in one of the bars",

          "What a joke that such an attraction only has tours with French speaking guides. Do the organisers think that the only people interested in this building are French? Surely common sense would prevail and a leaflet in English explaining in short what the guide is talking about",

          "It was worth the ticket price to see the inside of this typical European Opera House. However, if you wish to see the show make sure you have the most expensive tickets. Gave up at the interval as I could only see the dancers when they were in mid air!",
          "Went to see Coppelia at the theatre on 1st July 2013. The building is gobsmackingly beautiful from the outside, even more so when lit up at night. The inside does not disappoint, it's truly magnificent. The production we saw was by the Bordeaux ballet company and it was superb.",

La Cit\u00e9 du Vin gives a different view of wine, across the world, across the ages,...more Suggested Duration:More than 3 hours Address:\n134 quai de Bacalan Esplanade de Pontac, 33300, Bordeaux FranceMap ",
          "This place is amazing, a huge amount of time and effort has gone into helping visitors understnad the Bordeaux wine region and those from further afield. An audio tour is a must as all of the attractions have touch pads which you tap your device onto to understand what the",
          "I don't regret going, but there were quite a few flaws. Since this is such a world-renowned wine destination I think it is fair to have high expectations and it didn't stand up to other wine centres we have visited. The tech of the interactive exhibits was cool in theory but did",
          "Great spot. Architecture is stunning. They offer classes, tastings topside with views of the city. Museum exhibits its fantastic! Great couple hrs to enjoy. Then move on to next sites as it can take you a better part of the day to see all.",
          "An extraordinary building to look at, this would not initially strike you as an obvious wine museum. However the museum is testament to what has made Bordeaux wealthy. No matter how much you think you know about wine, it\u2019s history, it\u2019s influence over the ages and attached",
          "I recently visited la cite du vin in Bordeaux. There is a bit of a walk from main attractions in the center of Bordeaux to La Cite du Vin, but it is worth it if you make the journey. The main museum is definitely worth a visit. The museum goes through the history of wine,",
          "The museum is solely films and interactive things which you go around with your monitor. You touch the monitor to the display and are told something about the wine making history or process. I found it extremely dull. After this you go to the 8th floor for a thimble full of half",
          "It was amazing i have never seen anything like it i really recomend it so if you travled there it would amaze you",
          "This is a museum of wines of the Bordeaux region. It contains slide shows on giant screens, digital audio with information on the many displays, a top floor with views of the city, complimentary tasting of local wines, a restaurant, etc., all beautifully done. Highly recommend",
          "This was a breath-taking museum of the wines of the Bordeaux region. There were audio-assisted tours with excellent displays, a tower with views of the city, samples of local wines, a restaurant, and, of course, a gift shop. Definitely worth it.",
          "I was impressed by the organization of Cite du Vin.Everybody must visit this very different activity definitely.",
          "We were very excited to visit a museum of wine, in the heart of wine country. This place was not at all what we expected. Everything is digital, so basically just a room full of screens with prerecorded videos on. The interactive bits were also quite elementary and we felt a bit",
          "We spent over 4 hours here and left just before closing. You are each issued with an av machine which you point at the various circles. This means that despite wearing earphones a number of presentations are playing in French. 2 of our party came away with headaches. One of",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. There is almost too much in display inside. The main exhibition area has a lot of information. The top floor bar has great views of the city and great selection of wine.",
          "If you are in Bordeaux and have even a slight interest in Wine then you need to visit the Wine Museum. I spent over 4 hours and then enjoyed my complimentary glass of wine before leaving. There are numerous interactive displays from Wine regions around the world to experience",
          "Lots of interactive displays and good audio guide which interacts with the displays. Easy way to learn about wines around the world. Price included in the City Pass as long as you get there before midday. Easy to get to on Tram B.",
          "Great to learn about wine! You also get a complimentary glass with your ticket with panormic views of Bordeaux!",
          "We decided to pre-book our tickets via Trip Advisor, to beat the queue, as advertised. Unfortunately, when we arrived we went up to the exhibition entrance on the 2nd floor to be told that our tickets (still on our phone) were invalid. We therefore had to go back down to the",
          "We had a fantastic 5 days in Bordeaux and environs and were excited about visiting Cite du Vin. What an expensive disappointment! And what a waste of a tremendous new and unusual building. My main criticism was the patronising level of information about vines and wine",
          "Came here to hopefully learn lots of facts/knowledge on Wine but was left feeling underwhelmed. Paid 20 Euro for the tour plus Wine Tasting afterwards. We were hooked up with Audio Guides and headed through the interactive tour, maybe it was me but after about 10 minutes I was",
          "Throughly enjoyed our visit to the cit\u00e9 du vin; the wine cave is amazing and is a must see. The permanent exhibition was extremely interesting, the restaurant was good and the glass of wine in the belvedere whilst looking over Bordeaux was something to treasure. They said put",
          "There are lots of exhibits with multi-experience of sight, smell, touch, etc. to provide a wide-ranging experience to the appreciation of wine and its history. It was a pity that we did not cater enough time to enjoy the museum at a leisurely pace. We had only about 2 hours and",
          "Good use of time on a rainy day but... Audio guide clunky to use at the beginning. Gets easier. But the staff are much less than helpful, everyone instead chatting or looking at their phones. Welcome presentation on the big screens includes a nod to China. On their website only",
          "I had great expectations for this, I thought a wind museum in the world centre of wine would be interesting, informative and intelligent. It is in fact oversimplified, boring and patronising. I think any brasserie or Winebar in Bordeaux does a far better job.",
          "I'm sure this place is very nice, the only problem is that they continue to sell tickets up to 6pm when they close, at which point your ticket is useless. We asked when we arrived if we would have time to visit, and they said \"Sure! You can see everything and get your glass of",
          "Time was short so I did not play a visit, instead I take the boat along the river. Cost effective to use the daily public transportation for only 5\u20ac, else you also have the citypass that will give you better cost to give you free access inside and free ride on all tbm.",
          "For me 20 Euros ticket it\u00a8s expensve . Specialy if You go more than oneor family. But if You accept the price all the rest is worth the visit . It is like History Musemu ,Food Museum and Wine Culture Museum : all together in the same building . We really enjoyed the visit.",
          "this was one of the most incredible and high tech museums that you will ever see and it just happens to be all about wine. this museum is a tech lovers and oenophile's dream. the museum has spared no expense in bringing the world of wine to life. you can easily spend 10 hours",
          "Interesting place for everyone who wants to know anything about wine history and present, about local wines as well as french and world wines. And also great architecture building with view to lift bridge. Can be visited in City pass, including (one glass) wine testing.",
          "Big modern museum, lots of informations, some very basic, some really interesting. Geography, geology, history, culture... At the end a glass of wine with a nice view. But for non-French speakers there are no options for wine tasting. Shame on you!",
          "Spend both the time and money on visiting an actual winery, of which there are many around Bordeaux. La Cite du Vin is a wine Disneyland.",
          "The building is interesting and it worths a visit. We don't drink wine then we visited it only having extra free time. Nice souvenirs shop and a circle room panelled with bottles (both at ground floor) for wine selling - not French only. We noticed chinese bottled wine, as",
          "This museum is exceptionally well done. It has auditory guided tours that give just enough information at each exhibit within the museum. And the free glass of wine at the bar atop the museum is also worthwhile.",
          "Lots of locals here. They will also give you half glasses so you can try more kinds. Avoid sitting by the front door and it can be freezing.",
          "Great museum but you need at least 4 hours to give it enough time. This is an amazing experiential museum that we under estimated the time needed to properly savior the exhibits. This is a masterful learning museum that I wish we could have spent more time. The exhibits were",
          "You may skip this museum if you don't consider yourself a wine aficionado but I hope you don't ! It was truly a delightful, interactive and lovely way to experience the wine world. Now if you are a wine drinker---all the better since you will be able to enjoy wine on the 7th",
          "The place is very nice to visit especially if you are willing to learn about the history of wine, winemaking process and different wines worldwide. You can have an audio guide in a few languages. The exhibition is amazing and very creative! There is plenty of things to see and",
          "when you buy a ticket, you have a choice to pay extra to ignore the normal que and go via speed que, but when you are at the location they don\u2019t have this\ud83e\udd14option, there is one que for everyone. we did like to program and the technic behind it. really recommended. in the end",
          "Let's just say the architecture was contentious when it was proposed. Looks like a rubber ducky without the bill to me. I also found the layout a bit weird. You buy your tickets on the ground floor then you have to go up the the second floor. I think there was a meeting where",
          "Given the setting, it is a little hard to see this sculpture fitting into a very historic and traditional French architecture style; however, it works! Wine IS this region and it is fitting to have a building that makes the concept of wine stand out from the rest. It is",
          "Give yourself time and take sit breaks in between, there is sooo much to see in this museum. My husband and I loved it, especially the scent displays, so unusual. So alive and beautiful, that's how we felt after leaving this museum. Thank you france and all the countries that",
          "unbelievable experience, an interactive place, perfectly organized, a pleasure to be there. We enjoyed every minute of it, could have spent a whole day there",
          "A very modern setup congress centre with emphasis on wine. The rather curious abstract architecture is what strikes me first and inside is peculiarly interesting. It costs \u20ac20 to explore the permanent exhibition/wine information which includes a glass of wine (tasting",
          "If you are interesting in all things wine related than is the place for you. The musuem also has a good restaurant and gift shop.",
          "A must see - though I would worry about how busy it might get in season.... Fascinating look at the world of wine in the most interactive, modern & innovative way we have ever seen....",
          "This museum is a little far from the city center, and the cost is 20 euro (which includes a small glass of wine) but if you love getting extra knowledge about things you consume, it is worth wile going there. you may spend there an hour or a whole day, depending on your",
          "We spent a very interesting 4 hours learning all about the wines of the world. Really clever interactive displays. Only negative comment would be the audio headsets that were very cumbersome and difficult to keep on. Also nearly impossible to use if you are wearing hearing",
          "I felt like I was in a children\u2019s museum but for wine. This museum is insightful, interactive, modern and complete. If you know nothing about wine and it is your first visit to Bordeaux I recommend you do this on your first day and then go drink wine. Especially recommend you",
          "Visited in September with a load of family. Great exhibits. Entertaining and full of information. Good cafe and museum shop. The wine tasting was disappointing - you only get one wine to try. Even more disappointing the wine we tried we could not buy in the wine shop. That's",
          "After reading the negative reviews, I thought long and hard about spending the 20 euros for this attraction, but the threat of rain tipped the balance. Being invested, I spent almost four hours among the exhibits. I learned some things, but was somewhat frustrated by the",
          "You have your own device to listen in the language of your choice. Explore the floors and interactive exhibits. Fun, informative and you get to sample a glass of wine on the top floor (8th). A panoramic view of Bordeaux is seen. A lovely experience. I suggest getting the City",
          "We spent over three hours at this amazing facility. I learned lots about wine making in general, but so much about wines in the Bordeaux region. The high-tech exhibits are fantastic.",
          "Informative modern wine museum catering for multi languages - shame only one glass of wine included.....",
          "If you know nothing about wine this place is an education. If you have spent years practicing it is a bit long and tedious. When we visited it was basically the ground floor (with paydesk, cafe, shop and cave), the second floor exhibit and the eighth floor viewing platform with",
          "This place is amazing, it's the celebration of the culture of wine. You can taste it but the reason to visit is to learn more about it and not to get drunk. it deserve at least half a day (but even a full day is time well spent). It is a trip into the wine since the beginning",
          "The museum itself is very interesting. The wine tasting is less good. No where to sit, no tapas, a bit of a waste of time realy.",
          "This place can please both wine enthusiast and beginner too. A really well put together presentation as well as a stunning building.",
          "Nice architecture at the Garonne river but long queues in front of the cash desks like entering a football stadium. The overcrowded museum is not worth 20 Euros entrance fee.",
          "Maybe It was too crowded, maybe the audioguide things are not my fav, but I found this museum a little too over estimated. No really clear visiting path, Just point tour audioguide to one of the hundreds spots and listen. I expected some more basic introduction to how the wine",
          "Beautiful views form level 8 with glass of wine @\u20ac20 pp. Displays on level two really for the serious wine buff. But, perhaps a must do on a visit to beautiful Bordeaux.",
          "The Cite du Vin is world class museum with many interactive exhibits on the history of wine and of Bordeaux. The view from the top, sipping your glass of wine, is spectacular. Even the shop with displays of wine from around the world is worth checking out in detail. The",
          "My wife and I visited last April and wanted to have a wine tasting experience. Our agenda did not allow us to go into the museum, however we visited the restaurant on the top floor. The views are nice, the atmosphere is relaxing and the service very good. And we had our share of",
          "La Cite du Vin is one of the most unusual and cool museums we have ever visited. The displays and exhibits were interactive and fascinating. Very creative and fun. Plus, there is an ample tasting room. Highly recommended.",
          "Recently we went to a visit in Bordeaux to their new museum ''La Cit\u00e9 du Vin''. At first I thought it would just be about wine making and tasting, selling merchandise etc... but it was so much more. I loved the interactive mapped content surface of some displays at the museum",
          "A great place to visit loved it But it was very busy and I felt the numbers needed to be limited as the first area was very crowded with people pushing and shoving to tap their guide to hear the details of each exhibit.",
          "I found this museum a little underwhelming and a bit confusing. There didn't seem to be a flow to it. It's worth a visit I guess but....",
          "Visiting Bordeaux - then a visit to La Citie is a must to expand / enhance your knowledge of all wines in an entertaining way. It is easily accessible via Tram A from Place Quinconces. The architecture of the building itself is eye catching from the tram stop. On our first day",
          "We walked along the river all the way to La Cite du Vin. It was Friday around 1 pm and it was not crowded at all. We used their local machine to buy our tickets and we spent about 3 hours....it is impossible to hear and see all the attractions. We went to the 8th floor for",
          "I visited the Cite' and it was a remarcable experience. You can spend a lot of hours listening historic explanation about Wine. There also is a whole area dedicate to olfactive experience (you can smell fruit, cake, coffee, aromatic plants, etc). Finally, at 8* flop, you'll",
          "Only reason I gave it fewer stars is when we went it was so overly crowded. We had to wait in long lines just to tap our headsets to even hear the exhibit. Plan plenty of time as there are so many interactive exhibits plus a rotating exhibit. Then go back to the ground floor",
          "Lived up to it\u2019s architecture! Fabulous for knowledgeable wine lovers and even better for novices. Lots of easy interactive displays. So much interesting information. The bistro was very good and the bottle shop reasonable priced although not a lot of choice of new world wines",
          "Nice interactive introductory museum for individuals that would like to know about the history and production of wine. If you are knowledgeable about the history and production of wine, I do not recommend this museum. Wine tasting on the 8 th floor with a great view of the city",
          "A new inter-active museum about wine and wine history. Very unique methods of exhibition - super modern. The wine tasting at the end of the tour and the great view is great finale for the visit. Allow 2-3 hours for the visit. Don't miss it if you visit Bordeaux!",
          "A world wide tour of vineyards and wine making over the centuries. Can't help but learn about wine grapes and the methods used to raise them.",
          "Overall it\u2019s worth going The headset tech was a bit temperamental and we couldn\u2019t quite find everything in the museum Very interesting in parts. Good displays although not always easy to work out how to use them",
          "I think that this site will be very enjoyable for most people that have an appreciation of wine. Some however will find it quite remedial. The facility is amazing and there are a lot of neat exhibits but for some it will be just that, a neat exhibit. That however does not",
          "While in Bordeaux with friends, we visited La Cit\u00e9 du vin. Easily accessible with the A Tram, and exiting at the Cit\u00e9 du vin station, this place is a must to see. While not considered a museum, this place is a truly amazing place to visit while in Bordeaux. It explains the",
          "Shaped like a wine decanter. The views from the balcony are spectacular. Good selection of wine and tasting. Very informative about the terroir and climate. Worth a visit.",
          "Top Notch. Nice view of Bordeaux. If you enjoy museums and want to learn about wine, this is a great way to start. Vineyards from all over the world are discussed by the winemakers and vineyard owners. It explains wine as an art form, a science, an agriculture, a tradition,",
          "This is a great attraction. Very interesting and brilliant for children also. The adult tickets are a bit expensive but they include a (small) glass of wine at the top of the building. Great views from the top and a very interesting interactive tour.",
          "I visit this place guided by the online feedback. I payed the normal ticket: permanent exhibition, tasting at 8th floor - 20\u20ac. Nothing special or wow, same regarding the info that you can have inside the exhibition. I eat to The7Restaurant at the 7 floor: 1 foi grois, 1 cod",
          "We took the Tram to the museum on our last day and spent two hours at the museum. It was very interesting and explained wines from all over the world.",
          "This is for everyone, not just winelovers. The history of winemaking and its effect on different cutlures down through the ages is extremely interesting. Presentation is imaginative, with interactive exhibits - e.g. testing smells, matching food and wine for different menus.",
          "Nice experience in Bordeaux! We went to the museum before 12pm, as we had the city card it meant free entry before that time. Ticket is normally \u20ac20 without the card. Lots of interactive exhibits which explain how the wine is grown and produced. At the end of the museum exhibits",
          "The Museum of Wine is amazing. We started by doing a short tour and tasting which was the least fun but it got us in the proper frame of mind. Then we ate lunch with wine pairings at the restaurant at the top of the museum. The panoramic views were spectacular and the food",
          "Thanks to the personal devices you can take as much or as little time in each area of the museum depending on your preferences. I loved the little movie boxes, the smelling exhibit, the interactive dining table and the overall vibe of this place. They also have an amazing gift",
          "Myself and my partner visited le cite du vin on our first full day in Bordeaux and it didn't disappoint. The staff were friendly and super helpful. The exhibits were interesting. You could easily spend a whole day here.",
          "From smelling coffee and books to learning about how the ancient Greeks used wine in ceremony this museum has it all. Great interactive experience with touch points at every exhibit and regular special events. We spent time here during the Argentinian event which was great.",
          "Terrific interactional experience. Would go again. Lots to learn and a great view of Bordeaux with a glass of excellent wine in handb",
          "We spent about 3.5 hours and could have spent more. Good places to sit and rest and watch short videos, much to see walking around. History of wine, different regions, process of making wine, role in history, all well developed and explained. And you get a complimentary glass",
          "An amazing amount of interactive information abut wine, its origins and geographical dispersement. We especially liked the temporary exhibition on wine in Argentina which was visually stunning. The regular exhibit was marred by the initial failure of our technical device to",
          "Informative innovative in a unique environment quite a special place to visit to learn about wine from Bordeaux and around the world Highly recommended",
          "Do not miss la Cite du Vin while visiting Bordeaux. Even if you usually skip museums, you will be sucked in by the innovative presentation and interactive exhibits. And your visit ends with a complementary glass of wine in a bar at the top of the museum's tower.",
          "Very educational and a splendid view of the city of Bordeaux. They also provide helpful vineyards recoomendation.",
          "If you like wine, this museum will enhance your enjoyment. History of wine, interviews with people from the world\u2019s top wine regions, current innovations, and the wine service \u201cceremony,\u201d this is one of the best uses of interactive exhibit technology I have experienced. And the",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I spent about three hours here after we bought the tickets that included seeing all floors, including a wine tasting at the end. They offered a student discount too. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb It was a very beautiful place that really informs you about the wine-making process. However,",
          "We took tram b to the Cite du Vin. The building itself is a mazing to see. The insite is also a surprise. Have a look at all the wines and sites which are available.",
          "Our group of two Canadian couples decided to visit this recently complete museum and were very impressed with the building design, technology, interactive displays, layout on each floor and level of detail presented. As well, the wine tasting was a treat as the wine retail",
          "Many displays and exhibits, far too much for one visit! We also enjoyed the wine tasting and 360 degree view of Bordeaux from the 8th floor.",
          "What a waste of time.I had to line up in the ticket line with everyone else. Once I got to reception, the staff asked me to email them the online ticket by using an email address and it was only after that they could reissue the actual ticket which is required to scan into the",
          "This is a wonderful museum. Creative, beautiful, fun and informative. Lots of history woven into the story and importance of wine throughout history, starting with the Egyptians. State of the art exhibits with dazzling technology. While the museum will be of greater interest to",
          "Found the museum hard to follow. Only one wine taste was kind of cheapskate. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to see this.",
          "The \u2018permanent exhibition\u2019 is very informative, so big in fact you can spend hours there to the point it gets a bit much. When visiting this exhibition you cannot leave to have a break, or go get your glass of wine and then come back. You must complete it in one session so it\u2019s",
          "The building looks nice from outside but it's located in a non very interesting area of the city and far from downtown. The museum is small and not very well structured, it's not clear what route you should follow when you are inside and there's no one you can ask for help. It",
          "This all worked like clockwork. Even though I had forgotten to print out the confirmation it was clear I wasn't the first and it was all handled swiftly, efficiently and with a smile. I travelled with my daughter who is neither a \"young child\" or a \"teen\" so none of the boxes",
          "Well worth a visit for adults and even teenager . Probably not with young children though surprisingly interactive and interesting . Great views from the the top with a glass of wine of ones choice",
          "We got a combo ticket with the river wine cruise. You\u2019ll need about 3 hours here to do it justice. It\u2019s a great interactive tech experience and wine is the hero. The highlight is the glass of wine you get on the 8th floor!",
          "Part of the itinerary of an excursion off a cruise. All high tech audio guide, but not user friendly. These were not set up for individuals, but the audio followed the timing of the last person to log into that section. Good views from the Belvedere gallery. To take in all the",
          "We took the tram to the Cite du Vin, could have also used the river boat for same price. An advanced ticket really wasn't needed as the line for tickets moved quickly. The museum was quite expansive and easily absorbed the crowd and the exhibits were interesting. I enjoyed the",
          "Got in free with the Bordeaux city pass. Lots to see and do. Many interesting exhibits. Our visit included a free glass of wine (many to choose from) in the Belvedere. Great views of the city.",
          "Visited for the English language, one-hour wine tasting. This was well presented and demonstrated good expertise (as you would expect) in the grapes and wines of the area. Three wines were poured. I did not allow enough time to view the exhibition - 2 to 3 hours is suggested.",
          "Our favorite section of La Cite du Vin was the area where you can smell different aromas as they equate to the smells of different wines (including \"corked\" wine). The wine bottle ceiling lights in the tasting area are interesting and good photo subjects. It seems there are many",
          "We traveled from Bordeaux to Cadillac via motor coach. It was a great opportunity for viewing some amazing architecture such as the Corkscrew Bridge and building shaped to look like a glass of wine. We visited two wineries. Enjoyed the explanation of the growing season,",
          "As someone who has been to quite a few wine regions, the museum was a nice overview for somebody who wants to learn the basics. It was a good cross section of wine history, regions, and what you should be looking for. The glass of wine at the end of the tour on the top floors",
          "We went for lunch at La Cite du Vin, at the restaurant on the 7th floor (i forgot the name). The food was great, service was great, the view is wonderful. Please go check out La Cite du Vin and have yourself a wonderful time with a wide range of Wines to taste, drink and",

          "We were very impressed with La Cite du Vin and its modern, multimedia approach to teaching about the world of wine. We spent nearly 3 1/2 hours here. It gave us a new perspective on how much influence wine had on the economic growth of our world. Highly recommended. The films",
          "Honestly you could spend a whole day on this one. Especially if you have a leisurely lunch in the restaurant on the 7th floor providing a fabulous view of the Gironde and Bordeaux though it does not come cheap the we thoroughly enjoyed our fish dishes. First of all there is a",
          "Magnificent architecture combined with an elaborate history of worldwide wine.Triggers all the senses, well-set-up. Wine-tasting on the 8th floor is quite spectacular if you don't mind waiting in line. Surprisingly appropriate for all ages.",
          "I loved this museum Well organized Definitely get the audio Fun things to listen to So much wine So little time",
          "Its always great when you go to this wine museum and learn more about wine. You start by having a cup of wine in the top floor where you can enjoy the great views of the city and then you go down and learn all you can about the wines. A must go!",
          "There\u2019s lots of AV but not enough hands on. The smell section where you learn to identify the scents in wine was the highlight for me. The view from the upper floor is great and the architecture spectacular but at \u20ac40 for a couple, booking a wine tour and seeing the real thing",
          "We spent 1 1/2 hours exploring this beautiful building. Much to our surprise there were stations set up for the kids and tailored information just for them. They had a really wonderful experience! Highly recommended.",
          "At first I thought it was a lot of open space with smell stations and the like. Then I got into the feel of the place and the exhibits and interactive multi-media stations became fun and very educational. The temporary exhibit on Argentina and it's wine industry was fantastic.",
          "Nice interactive activity, the layout kind of overwhelming,although it's organized. Negative point is the \"wine tasting activity\" only one wine allowed per entry ticket and not really a good Bordeaux. Should be able to purchase more tastings and improve the selection....",
          "Museum was OK, but not on the same level as Guinness factory or Jamesons in Dublin which are much more engaging. Lots of listening to people talk through self-guided headphone tour which wasn't really as expected. Nice glass of wine and view from the top floor though! (despite",
          "It costs 20 euros to visit - but you have to spend time to appreciate the museum and therefore good value. The building itself gives good views form the top floor, and is an usual piece of architecture. All the displays are high tech using headphones and a wi fi player.",
          "Be sure to have atleast 1/2 a day to go to La Cite du Vin. Very informative with big screens featuring different countries and their wine making process. There is a large circular room with wines from all over the world which one can purchase. The restaurant was closed when",
          "This is easily accessed on Bordeaux\u2019s excellent metro tram system. Anyone will learn facts about wine at this museum. The question is whether this is the best way to spend 20 euros and your time in this community. If you go, know that the ticket price includes a free glass of",
          "This is not situated in a particularly attractive part of town, but is on a tram line. City Passes are only valid in the morning. At first there are some interesting videos about wine, the terrain and climate and how this affects taste etc. But unless you are one of those",
          "Fantastic visitor attraction dedicated to all things wine. Can easily spend 4 hours here going around the exhibit space and listening to the visual shows. Bit out of the centre but easy on the tram.",
          "I enjoyed my visit, but I won\u2019t rush back! There were some interesting exhibits, particularly identifying smells. Everyone gets a headset which was great although very interactive which meant when it was busy I simply couldn\u2019t access certain parts as there were constantly people",
          "A very interesting and fascinating museum. Not only for wine enthusiasts. We were there for a few hours and still didn't cover it all. The area of scents is amazing, not to give it up. It is recommended to stay for at least several hours",
          "Overall we both really enjoy La Cit\u00e9 du Vin. The building is exciting and interesting. The various exhibit/teaching area are very good, although in a few places I thought more detail could have been given. The headsets supplied worked very well and were simple &",

          "I was expecting more details about wine itself. It was more oriented at the history of wine in Europe and France. Many of the displays were video and brief - possibly oriented to the short attention spans of millennials? You use a portable audio device to get the audio",
          "You love wine you know it deeper! First time I skip to enter the museum and second visit is no regret at all. Great knowledge and experience about wine aside vineyard visiting. Great architecture and interior in Bordeaux. Highly recommendation!",

          "Museum of everything wine. A wonderful modern building. Take the ferry from the city centre to enjoy a river cruise as well. We particularly enjoyed the wine sampling but all the wine history and production explanations you could possibly ever want. If you have a few hours to",
          "Worth every Euro. Wonderful building and experience. We could not fault any part of the building or exhibit. Really great.",
          "We enjoyed the museum a lot. Appreciated the history of wine from different countries. enjoyed the panaromic view on the 8th floor. service in cafeteria below was super slow but food was okay. a must visit in Bordeaux.",
          "This seemed like a children's museum - lots of interactive exhibits and 101 videos. Rooftop restaurant view was great, but menu is extremely limited.",
          "Expecting to learn something about the Bordeaux region. You just get a bad overview of most of the wines and the wine history. except the building everything is really really poor! Don\u2019t go to the restaurant and taste wine there - it\u2019s a ripp off!",
          "we took a trip out expecting to find a whole range of attractions , but only found this beautiful modern building",
          "While in the area for work related to wine decided to stop by museum. Great rainy day activity. Entrance starts at only \u20ac20 which includes a wine tasting on top floor with 360 degree of the city. Restaurant Le 7 great way to end the tour overlooking the river, some patio seating",
          "Was excited to visit this museum but I had seen not so good reviews but still felt I needed to check it out. It was not worth the entry fee, we didn\u2019t like the way it was set up, a bit chaotic in there. We received one glass of wine, which was ok. The best part of the tour was",
          "Bordeaux and its region are known for their wine.Indeed, several of the city's recommended attractions are about wine. The first among them, in my mind, is La Cite Du Vin, a kind of a monument glorifying wine. The building is impressive and beautiful, both externally (its",
          "If you know nothing about wine, this is definitely the place to visit. I believe it's been designed to appeal to the children of the visitors, and to get them interested in wine in anticipation of them becoming of drinking age. Every exhibit was very basic, almost insultingly so",
          "Well worth a visit if your in Bordeaux especially if you take the boat taxi there and back along the river A must for wine lovers",
          "Time was tight so up to the restaurant near the top for a coffee and amazing selection of small desserts on a platter all for 10 Euro with really good coffee. The view is excellent and service equally good, you can go to the viewing floor for some amazing views over the city and",
          "I regard myself as one who knows a bit about wine and drinks it regularly. But this place proved that there is much to learn. Through multi media screens one learns about the history of wine cultivation, how landscapes around the world has been changed through wine cultivation,",
          "Good place to visit. The highlight was the free glass of wine near the top of the building with great views and wine! We arrived late (about 5 and had to rush) since we had plans the next day and couldn't get back. I highly recommend even at 20 euro per person!",
          "The building is astounding. The permanent exhibit is confusing and crowded. Not a place for the shy or retiring, as you have to muscle your way to the front of each exhibit to activate the audio on your device. There is no clear path to follow and each of the exhibits is too",
          "This museum is very well done. They use a number of different techniques to convey the message which kept it all very interesting. We spent 1.5 hours here and didn't finish or get to the top where we were told they have a wine tasting. They provide audio devices in a number",
          "If you like wine, put this place on your list when visiting Bordeaux. Beautifully designed, lots of space and some very well thought out exhibits. Everything you ever wanted to know about wine and more!",
          "We enjoyed a fascinating afternoon, finding many interesting facts about wine and viniculture, perfect for a very hot day. Unexpectedly, we were able to stop in the restaurant and enjoyed an early dinner of charcuterie, overlooking Bordeaux.",
          "Worth a visit but we thought it lacked signage and ticket information to know exactly what was available. We didn\u2019t want a full tour, just to go up to see the view from the high floor, we did get there in the end but we still weren\u2019t sure we had done it properly. \ud83d\ude06",

          "We visited the Cite du Vin during our recent trip to Bordeaux. The architecture of the structure alone makes it worth visiting, as well as the fact that it is a good long walk from the center, so you can work off all of the fabulous food and wine bordelais. We opted not to use",
          "This museum provides a good overview of wine history, including but not limited to Bordeaux wine making. Lots of great info; you can spend hours here. The only drawback was that the cafe is outside of the exhibit area, so you need to end your visit to get a coffee/snack. We",

          "If you want to learn about wine in general, and all over the world, this is the place for you. If you want to learn a little more about the wines of the Bordeaux region, this is not the best place. Lots and lots of information about world wide viticulture and wines, but not so",
          "The Cite du Vin is a landmark that can hardly be missed in Bordeaux, as its futuristic and modern design stands out very clearly, but it's not just the outside that catches the eye here. The expositions are curated to be very lifelike and friendly for all ages, engaging the",
          "This is the wine museum and is well worth a visit. Amazing building and fantastic the way it is laid out., all on Level 2. There is usually a temporary exhibition on Level 1 , on this visit it was all about Argentina. Remember to go to Level 8 for the Wine tasting.",
          "This architectural gene contains a very well accomplished theme museum, which as its name states is dedicated to wine and it\u2019s history.",
          "This is must see for wine lovers. Museum is informative and well designed but could work on signage department bit more. Getting between different floors is bit of a challenge as you don't have really clear idea of how your visit should be structured. Then again, these are",
          "My husband and I had seen a few different travel shows in Bordeaux. They all mentioned going to this museum. We thought how can we learn more about wine than we already do? Well it is about that and so much more! Truly interesting and interactive exhibits through out. Buying",
          "We spent about 3 hours here but still did not see everything. We already had the CityPass so our entry was free (as long as we came before noon). The exhibits were plentiful, interactive plus multimedia and held our interest longer than expected. Plus there was a free wine",
          "This trip was ok. This museum consists of mainly videos and interactive things. The smell section was the most interesting. The tasting bar and the wines available are nice. However if a few more tastings were included it would make it worth the money",

          "First my husband was excited by the ideea becouse he is passionated by wines and their stories. The building perfect outside looking, and inside all very good organised but i recomand the activity just if you are a wise , cleaver person. Is an activity to make it if you like to",
          "You can spend 10 minutes or 2 days going around. In any case all there is to know about wine is concentrated there. Tramway takes you there and a walk back along the river is great. Great shop in the lobby area and interesting wine tasting on the top. Repeat visits are never",

          "I enjoyed the introductory English-language wine class and learned new things, in particular about the fascinating history of the region. It felt like a good value. I wish that more in-depth classes were offered more frequently, with an opportunity to try higher-end wines.",
          "This is a good resource for real aficionados of wine. Plenty of tours and workshops. We just wanted to experience the architecture, so for free we were able to explore the bottom floor and the first, which includes a reading room. We took the elevator to the seventh floor",

          "Second visit here after seeing it on a previous visit. Sorry to say but the overall experience was disappointing. The interactive exhibits whilst innovative are difficult to understand and many don\u2019t seem to work correctly. Time for a refresh I think.",
          "Crowded disorganized mess. Logistical nightmare. Be prepared for amusement park-level queues, primarily because the staff cannot get routing right. Be also prepared to queue up for at least 10min to get a glass of mediocre wine. Spend EUR20 on 1 ticket, but all I wanted was to",

          "It\u2019s a very cool building and used amazing technology for some of the presentations but was looking for more information than was offered. At the end of the visit I hadn\u2019t actually learned anything about wine production, tools of the trade or wine as a business.",
          "Poorly organized, no structural overviewThe building is magnificent and the cite du vin is certainly worth a visit, not only for the museum, but also the views from the Belvedere, the restaurant on the 7th floor, the wine-tasting workshops, and the wine shop. The museum has many",

          "Wine is difficult to explain but this museum has come very close to it. I would suggest to plan 3 hours for a visit.",

          "Marvelous building. There is a lot of information about wine but lots of it is fairly dry. There are some interactive exhibits. One the best is letting you smell different aromas. You can tell people put a lot of money into this but if you have some experience with wine, you",
          "Spent a wonderful, but too short, afternoon in the La Cite du Vin. The technology is excellent. The audio guide allows you to interact with the different exhibits and learn all about the history, making of wine and the different terroirs that produce wine throughout the world.",
          "We enjoyed our visite here very much. The museum is very modern and interactive. You get a good introduction to the story of wine, the different wine regions and different types of wine. They give you an interactive audioguide and you can choose how much you want to dive into.",

          "For 20 EUROS you get to enter an ugly and confusing building; watch a tech-savvy but banal and tedious audio-visual display, and get about three drops of wine in a glass that constitutes a 'wine tasting'. Most of the wines for tasting on the day we visited were from South Africa",
          "This is definately worth a visit and the entrance fee. After hours of history, aromas andtales to laugh at you have a wine tasting. You need to put 3 hours to one side for this experience",

          "There is so much information to learn from, but the crowds of people and the need to tap your electronic device to activate the talks means you are left standing trying to find something to listen to. The wine sample at the end was just one small glass. I would not reccomend.",
          "No matter if you\u2019re a wine connoisseur or just zip 3$ bottle of wines, this is a museum you need to visit. And immersive experience that activates all your senses and intrigues your interest about wine! A very innovative museum. I loved the part where you could smell all the",

          "As with other reviews, there was no line to skip! Plus, as I hadn\u2019t printed out the ticket, and showed it on my phone, I then had to email it to the man standing in front of me! This took longer than buying a ticket!! However, the trip was very much worth it",
          "Very well done modern musuem. You can your audio guide at each display and it plays the video in your language. At the end of your trip you go up to the 8th floor for a glass of wine with spectacular views. Entry and tasting are included with the citypass if you visit before",
          "Probably best suited for school trips of children aged from about 6 to 12. My 2 older teenagers became bored very quickly. They do have a wine tasting area on the 8th floor for adults and a free glass was included in the ticket, they offer grape juice for the kids if asked.",
          "The Cit\u00e9 du vin is a good place to visit if you had a couple of hours, it has stories and in depth history of wine. The audio/interactive tour was interesting and very useful mostly, but also a bit frustrating when it didn't work. My favourite part was the scents in glass jars.",
          "Great idea but lacking. Many of the areas were not functioning. You also can't preview or read, you can only listen, so you have to wait for slow intros to see if it is even something you are interested in. It was hard to learn as much as I wanted to because of this, unless you",

          "It\u2019s amazing all the things one can learn about wine while visiting la Cit\u00e9 du vin. Just the architecture is worth it. It\u2019s also a modern museum where you\u2019ll find lots of interactions. We also took a wine-tasting pass (adults only), which allowed us to taste a variety of great",

          "My husband and I visited this museum before going on several wine tastings later in our trip\u2014we learned a lot that helped us get more out of our later wine chateau tours. The exhibits run the gamut from videos to interactive games and puzzles. You can choose from many different",
          "Amazing concept, location and view. The best part is you can go by Boat or Tram and enjoy the best wines of France. Apart from that Bordeaux is one of the best place in France which may not be famous on the list of travelers from Asia but Americans love this place. I was in",
          "Congratulations! Yami is a very professional sommelier, made an excellent workshop and met all our expectations. We highly recommend it and especially with Yamil. There are no lines to get into the museum, there's a coffee and restaurant inside, and they also have different",

          "As a lover of architecture, the building is worth visiting itself. Yes as other reviews have said its all a bit high tech, but its super and really interesting to spend some time out of the sun and learn. The viewing gallery and bar area is great, I half expected a choice of two",
          "Really interesting, everything you want to know on wine around the world and along the time You can enjoy a glass with a nice panoramic view on Bordeaux and buy exotic wine Definetely a place to be in Bordeaux",

          "The wine museum is absolutely worth while. Even if you know one or two things about the wine business, this museum fills in the knowledge gaps. It is an alcoholic time machine in the best sense of the word. It is spacious, has a modern design and is a treat when it comes to",
          "Great place to learn about wine and seemed to be geared towards complete novices. The restaurant on site (ground floor) was great value and the free wine on the top floor was a bonus. Try and visit outside of the weekend so you can fully experience the place. When we went it",
          "If you have an interest in wine then a visit to La Cite du Vin is a must when visiting Bordeaux. With use of modern technology they make so many of the facts about wine growing come to life. You will need a few hours if you want to take in all that is on offer. There is also a",

          "This is a very modern high-tech wine museum and a unique one for sure. If you are a wine lover or surrounded by wine lovers, it may be worth the visit. The museum makes a valiant effort to humanize wine and tells you why there are wine lovers. Highly educational in that it",
          "This was the best experience we had whilst in Bordeaux. First of all the sommelier, Yamila, was amazingly sweet, and extremely knowledgable, also speaking several languages. Shw have us so much information from history and geography to the proper ways to taste wine and pairing.",

          "Took the Line B Tram to Cite du Vin. No queues to get in so easy to get tickets and start the tour. You are given headphones etc in your language and these work with the interactive parts of the tour /exhibition. The information is about world wines (not just those of the",

          "Came here as part of the city pass, really enjoyed the exhibit - it's super modern and informative (you could spend the whole day here, but we squeezed a visit into a couple of hours). Enjoyed the interactive exhibits and, of course, the wine tasting!",

          "Great place to visit. The audio visual experience is well thought out and also involves your sense of smell as well.  I particularly liked the discussion of \"terroir\" which is key component of wine making.",
          "Plenty of things to listen, watch and experience. Can easily end up spending there up to 4 hours. You get to taste one wine of choice on top of the building and it's included in price of the 20\u20ac ticket.",
          "Great visit, plan at least 2 to 3 hours if you wanna see and experience everything. And the view at the top is gorgeous.",
          "Great vine museum,  visited all around and learned a lot about the region. Got to taste at the top and view the city...",
          "Great high tech museum. Worthwhile.",
          "Really interesting visit.  I would think that children of all ages would be bored but for adults with any passing interest you should enjoy it.  The interactive guide in English and other languages is very useful and unlike many French \u2026",
          "Well worth spending 1/2 day here to dive into wine. Content is at a good level - not so basic that wine aficionados would be bored, but not so advanced that you need an M.S. \n\nOne tip - the standard ticket includes a wine tasting at end, \u2026",
          "Gets a little boring along the way. It's better to take an actual wine tour, going to the vineyards, etc",
          "the museum - must visit for any wine lover, nice bistro with Enomatic machines",
          "Great exhibits. Well presented. We learned much about the history and making of wine. It was easy to get to. Be sure to use free audio guides; the museum makes sense only if you take it.",
          "So much fun..loved listening/watching interactive displays, smelling the aromas and of course sampling the wine!",
          "Ok. Technology was a bit style over substance.\n\nWould have liked more detail on how the stuff is actually made! How did the vineyards survive the downturns, wars and disease? How did the wine of the middle ages compare to today? Glass bottles, when did they take over?\n\nNice but disappointly shallow.",
          "Very interesting museum with the added bonus of a glass of wine at the end. You really could spend a whole day here if you looked at and listened to everything. Paticularly like the \" aroma\"  exhibits.",
          "The visit is highly interactive, which engages and immerse the users. The visuals are stunning and the contents really informative. A good time spend I'm here!",
          "If you ever wanted to know hell a lot about wine, this place should be on your list.  Having spent close to three hours (would have loved to spent more time except that we were hurried up by the kids for lunch) I felt quite enlightened all \u2026",
          "For the museum, Average. The technical paddles used to access the information worked poorly. Good concept in places but ultimately tiresome and with no people to help during the exhibition.\n\nHowever the restaurant and service, excellent.",
          "While a little repetative it has a lot of information aranged in an engaging way for adults and kids",
          "Very nice, modern museum. You can really get familiar with wine history, from the ancient Egypt or Greece up until today. And not just history, the interactive part was my favourite!\nService is nice, speak English very well. Propably better \u2026",
          "There is possibility to participate on organized vine tasting in rooms designed for this purpose. The audience can sit around a circle at tables, that have a mini washbasin to use during tasting. At the top it is possible to order buffet \u2026",
          "Attractive and spacious building. Great views over the city from the Belvedere. Plenty of video displays with good seating. Good range of interactive displays. \nUnsuitable for hearing impaired visitors as heavily dependent on audio \u2026",
          "Not impressed at all especially given the entry price. The interactive exhibits are tedious to use and tempremental to reset ready for next person. There are nowhere near enough user terminals so you'll also end up waiting for everything if \u2026",
          "A must visit in Bordeaux. The entire museum is interactive with informative exhibitions (for all the senses). Great for all ages.",
          "Wannabe, underwhelming interior, disorganised exhibition with way too many screens and not enough of real stuff. Don\u2019t buy the wine tasting option as the wines offered are simply not worth it.",
          "This is s must visit when in the Bourdeax region. This place explains away some of the myths of wine making and the differences of where and how the vine can be influenced in different regions around the world. Its not just about French \u2026",
          "Permanent exhibition is very well organized.  You can access free if you purchased Bordeaux City pass",
          "Great museum that teaches everything you need to know about wine. There are many interactive activities about the history of wine and of the city of Bordeaux. You can also have a sample glass at the top floor, where there is a great view and many options to taste, from different countries.",
          "Interesting museum of wine. You must check the days and time for visit and wine tasting for not to pay for nothing if you come late. Also you can buy souvenirs and different kinds of wine there. They have also rare wines. But prices here \u2026",
          "It's a very interesting place with a lot of interesting information of wine. There are history, the texture, smell, wine in each region and a lot more. They also have the device to deliver the information. It's worth going and worth all the time and money if you are interested in wine. Go there, trust me.",
          "Really interesting exhibition about wine but it was very crowded which did make it hard to access/ listen to some of the things. Definitely come in the morning, and book in advance online.",
          "I loved this place. It\u2019s a most in Bordeaux.",
          "This I found mildly disappointing.  The top floor with the view while sipping good wine, yes, that part is cool but the 'museum' part was not so interesting at all.  Certainly not worth the amount we paid for 5 people.  I was expecting real \u2026",
          "Very nice architecture of the building and a quite interesting exposition with audio guides for foreigners, although the headphones isolate the members of the group. A major weakness is that you have to wait for the animations to finish for \u2026",
          "You can learn different wine cultivation, ethics of having wine here through different visual medium. Not much physical work flow or objects to see.",
          "Fantastic value. Lots to do, see, listen, smell and taste. Can recommend the tasting experience",
          "Huge space, very interactive, surprisingly loads of stuff for children. However, quite expensive for a museum.",
          "A lot of interactive things to do and see. Making education on wine more interesting.  And the icing on the cake is having a free glass at the top whilst taking in the views.",
          "Allow at least a half day. The interactivity is great. Take one of the classes if you have time.",
          "This museum is very modern and interesting to look at but overall we were disappointed. We didn't learn anything new about wine as it was all very general information (wine tastes different from different parts of the world....). I didn't \u2026",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Cite du Vin. Very informative and they have a fair price on wine purchases from around the world",
          "After reading some reviews, I wasn't looking forward to the crowds there. I was willing to suck it up to visit. To reduce some headache, I bought the tickets online to avoid the queue. When we got there just after opening, I was relieved \u2026",
          "Absolutely a museum where you have to go when in Bordeaux. I am not a huge museum adventurer but this one has everything. Also for the people that are not really into vines. I drink vine occasoinally but I am a way more paassionate tea \u2026",
          "I\u2019m so confused. So much information, great technology (maybe too experimental/conceptual) and an amazing building but I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019ve learned how wine is made-that wave-your-hand-over exhibit didn\u2019t seem to work consistently. \u2026",
          "Interesting, could spend a very long time wandering",
          "This building looks a lot like the Guggenheim but in this case of wine... \nWe started the experience from the rooftop were you are invited to try a glass of Bordeaux wine. From there you can see the city from an upper position and enjoy the \u2026",
          "It wasn't busy but felt busy, found it awkward to navigate. Went for a tasting up on the 8th floor but the lines were not clear and many people would just push to the front.  View was nice though. Easy to get to on the B train. Found it interesting for the most part and very interactive. Great for family groups.",
          "It's a nice experience. It's all about going around watching movie clips and some interactive stuff. Didn't do everything but managed to do most stuff.\nQuite cold inside.",
          "Very nice place for get knowledge of wines (but not for Burgundy). Restaurant Le 7 is very good.",
          "Interactive and fun museum dedicated to the wine \ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf77\nI had so much fun with all the features and technology they have. I also learned so much about wine ! Love love love. \nAt the end they have a wine store and right across the street there is a beautiful market to have a glass of wine.",
          "Very interactive. Beautiful rooftop",
          "Not really worth a visit, it's a tourist trap. You won't learn much about wine, and listening to all of the audio guides gets boring quickly. The building itself is also quite bizarre. You do get a glass of wine at the top floor at the end though, which is nice, but the views are disappointing.",
          "One of the best museums I ever visited. Go on a day where you don't have much to do because I spent 4 hours there just learning everything I could about wine!! Amazing!! The entrance is free with the City Pass and gives 1 wine tasting if you arrive before mid-day.",
          "Excellent experience, great use of technology and very informative exhibition on the history of wine. The building is stunning. A must see if you're in Bordeaux\ud83c\udf77",
          "Fascinating history of wine. A real pity that they don't have the wine that we tasted at the end available to purchase in the shop downstairs.",
          "A little out of the way to get here, but a lovely walk along the river from the centre of Bordeaux (or you could get the tram). \n\nInteresting looking building and clearly a lot of thought had gone into this to showcase wine. So if you're \u2026",
          "nice to visit for people looking for wine history and local tasting, better in the morning time as some of tasting may end up earlier",
          "A very informative and interactive museum about wine and it's history. Great place to spot by for a couple of hours if you are a wine enthusiast.\n\nFor 20 euros per person, you get access to the museum and a free tasting of your choice of \u2026",
          "Excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Too many things to see and do in one visit. The glass of wine at the end was a very nice way to finish our tour.",
          "Great city views from top lounge. Interesting information.",
          "Cite du vin is fascinating! I absolutely love their innovative displays. We spent 5 hours there and still didn't see everything.",
          "We went on a multi sensory wine tasting which cost \u20ac20 (student price I think? It was \u20ac32 for the museum as well as the wine tasting; a little too expensive so we just went for wine tasting) \n\nIt was an immersive experience, with visuals, \u2026",
          "Very clever from a technical point of view, with interesting information and exhibits, but on a busy day every audio guide section starts half way through because another visitor is already using it. Means you either have to wait for it to restart, (between 1 to 10) mins, or just loose bits.",
          "Amazing experience at this placr ! Take your time to learn all the secrets and knowledge about wine, grapes and vines. If you are a wine lover it's our place. The exhibition have many high tech supports . Everything is translate to English and other European languages including audioguides .",
          "Great place. You could spend days here learning about wine and history.",
          "It is nicely designed, with interesting and informative displays. A nice way to spend a rainy Sunday.",
          "Very nice museum. Sometimes a clearer guideline conducting the visit is missing",
          "An absolute must for any wine lovers. It's free entry and very easy to get to from the tram too.",
          "I love all the interactive features inside! Very educational!",
          "Fun place for families. There are 3 parts: a rotating exhibit that ended up being glass, an interactive exhibit and then Belvedere upstairs for a small glass of your choice of wine. \nThe exhibit downstairs was incredibly interactive. You \u2026",
          "Really disappointing.  We had hoped this to be a highlight of our visit to Bordeaux. Very expensive entry, additional costs for access to other parts of the visit. \nThe wine tasting was poor indeed. You purchase your ticket along with your \u2026",
          "Very nice place, also for families with children.",
          "Educational; learnt a lot about wine. Very interactive. Fun for adults and kids too. The view from the 8th floor is magnificent. Time just flew by. Also quite easy to access with the city pass",
          "A fantastic museum, not at all like I imagined. The most interactive museum I have been to thus far. Very interesting, not just for the lovers of wine. I spent more than 3 hours there and still didn't see everything.",
          "Impreasive. The view from the 8.th floor is wonderfull and the restaurant from the 7.th floor is perfect. Very tasty food and fair price. An impreasive list of international wines for everybody.",
          "I think it's a must! The building is modern and beautiful, the showroom is amazing, there is a lot of things to see. The belvedere 360 view is not as I expected (not the best view of Bordeaux). Wine tasting atelier was an incredible experience.",
          "Absolutely stunning. We tok a different wine tasting work shop and it was marvelous. Architecture of the building is WOW! Museum it self is also wort to see!",
          "A tedious way to see a museum. Much slower than simply reading.  Good views from the 8th floor",
          "The staff were friendly and saw that I had trouble walking so asked of I wanted to borrow a wheelchair as it was a long walk round exhibition. It was also interactive so very informative and accessable.",
          "Well executed fine dining level French cuisine with a good wine list and a great view",
          "First one bad thing: We had just limited time to spend on exploring and too much was wasted on gimmicky, half-broken, annoying interactive pieces. These are so unnecessary, given the amounts of crowds, especially at the beginning. The \u2026",
          "Had a lovely meal at Restaurant Le 7 with great views. The water was expensive though at 5 Euro 50!",
          "Such a fantastic place !!",
          "Too crowded i couldnt see or learn anything. For 20 euro per ticket you could do much better!!!",
          "Great in depth museum about wine, very interesting sensory workshop with 4 different wine tasting and comparison.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours. Very modern with an immersive permanent exhibition. Also learned a bit about wine. Plus a nice glass included at the bar up the top. We went with our 6 month old baby for those wondering if it's suitable.",
          "Very special architecture, lovely exhibition, very interesting. Take your time to enjoy all the different parts of the exhibition. Enjoy a good Glas wine afterwards on the 8th floor with a nice 360\u00b0view on Bordeaux.",
          "Good selection of wine. Great small plates. Chocolates were lovely",
          "Overrated!!!  For \u20ac20, I expected more than semi-functioning equipment and a 1/2 bottle of wine.  This place is cool (futuristic building, etc), but I walked away learning nothing new about wine.  I\u2019d suggest the Vin and Negoce museum instead, that was much more educational.",
          "Very posh location, if you like this kind of place",
          "This has got to be the worst museum I\u2019ve been to. To think that this is a wine museum in the middle of France, the presentation and topics covered were more like corporate presentations. Tedious, boring and completely not related to the joy \u2026",
          "Great exhibits and technology. Very poor layout and planning for \"how to see\" the museum.",
          "Well done. You have to visit.",
          "The place is nice but the experience is ruined by 1h waiting to enter despite having bought the ticket online.... you brag of being innovative and then you don't have a simple technology in place to read the City Pass and online tickets or hace more than just one cashier to process the tickets.",
          "Very digital interactive museum. Probably the best experience I've had in a museum. Totally recommend! They should add more wine tasting and not just one glass tho...",
          "Excellent explanation of wine history, culture, the wine making process, and the historical events sorounding the production of wine from the beginning of recorded history forward.",
          "It was a truly multi sensory experience. Not only the usual dioramas, etc. but the place has a number of experiences where you can experience smells. High tech audio devices translated visual and auditory displays into your preferred \u2026",
          "The people who created this exhibition were definitely wasted on wine. Interesting content but worst execution ever! 20\u20ac and everything is electronic. You have to wait your turn for a series of hundreds of videos. Your cannot go at your own pace. Don't go if you are mildly claustrophobic.",
          "A bit pricey for the entrance fee. \n\nEasy to find as many trams pass by this area or you can have a leisure walk from the outlet area and buy some for your shopping. \n\nIt has clean toilets but no free wifi in this building provided for \u2026",
          "An amazing experience of all senses. Take 2-3 hours and go in early afternoon when it is not as busy. Not to be missed!",
          "The display is detailed and extensive - a bit more than we could handle in an afternoon.  All of the displays are electronic and audio, which is cool, at least at first, but after a while we didn't use the audio much and ended up skipping \u2026",
          "Overall, a great museum. Super high tech and interactive, though I did miss some of the more regular museum experience (like the simple wall panels providing overviews). The permanent exhibition is very large, takes btw 1.5 / 2hrs. The \u2026",
          "We went on the wine cruise down the Garonne from here. We thought we would hear the story of vines in Bordeaux and it's development as a wine centre but it was all about the history and buildings in Bordeaux.  We did taste two pleasant wines. Overall we didn't think the trip was value for money.",
          "Great place to visit in Bordeaux and Well Done for the fantastic staging. Despite few missing wine location in world ( Swiss wine ...what!!!.....Madagascar...what!!!)",
          "Fascinating and well constructed exhibition.  Free samples could be larger tho!... And pay a visit to the indoor Market on the other side of the road, its amazing!",
          "Very contemporary museum of wine and vintaculture, with tasting rooms, exhibits and a beautiful rooftop restaurant. You'll spend the better part of a day here but save some energy to explore the neighborhood.",
          "What a truly amazing place! Leave here having had a fun time and knowing more about wine than you ever thought possible. Well worth the 20 Euro admission price. Amazingly well executed exhibits that are at once fun to see and nicely \u2026",
          "Pretty good. A lot in there about the use and transportation of wine through the years, not a huge amount on the manufacturing process. :)",
          "It isn't physically large, but there is an incredible amount of information packed into the space. It's sleek, stylish, and very cool. We only spent 2 hours here and I think we could've easily stayed twice as long",
          "A must go! Even if you don't drink wine! Loads of interactive features which keeps it interesting and fun for all while learning about the history and the art of making wine! Plus it comes with free wine tasting once you're done learning. Perfect!",
          "Excellent museum in a beautiful setting. The 8th floor gives a totally different perspective of Bordeaux. We had breakfast across the road in Halles de bacalan which set us up for the day!",
          "Crowded disorganized mess. Logistical nightmare. Be prepared for amusement park-level queues, primarily because the staff cannot get routing right. Be also prepared to queue up for at least 10min to get a glass of mediocre wine. Spend EUR20 \u2026",
          "Exhibition is well set out and the interactive guide works well. I thought there would be more info about the process of making wine. Tasting on the top floor worth it for the view. Only one glass though!",
          "Beautiful place,  we had a lovely light lunch on 7th floor with great views of the river and city.  Pressed for time,  we did not have enough time to see all the exhibitions . Will definitely return.",
          "Good fun. Can be a bit contrived if you already know a good deal about wine.",
          "If you are a true wine-nerd, then you can give it a 5 stars.",
          "Paid \u20ac20 (student price) for a multi-sensory wine tasting experience. The staff was very knowledgable about the wine and the different scents and notes in each. We were given 4 different types to try.",
          "Excellent interactive audio and visual presentations in a beautiful building however really only found about 25% of the displays interesting.  Free wine at the end made the ticket price a little more palatable.",
          "An impressive iconic building that sits on the river. However i found the tour to be overrated and expensive. It's unusual, but i found myself bored within 10 minutes. \nThe ticket does include a wine tasting. This turned out to be quite \u2026",
          "Informative museum and lots to see. Self guided tour around the exhibits. The wine tasting on the 8th floor was the highlight. Great views across the river and the city. Good range of wines to chose from too.",
          "Defiantly worth the trip. We paid 32 euros each which included the \u20ac20 standard entry fee and the hours wine workshop. Note, the only English workshop was at 4.30 pm. We arrived at 12.30 so had little while exploring and having lunch which \u2026",
          "Too expensive for watching computer screen. The visit consists only to go from one screen to the other. After the building is very nice but it s not worse to spend money for the visit.",
          "Nice building",
          "Must visit for wine lovers. They also have nice selection of wines from all over the world",
          "What a fantastic space, full of interesting exhibits and a stunning view from the 8th floor.",
          "The main exhibit is a series of videos talking about different wine regions. The observation deck is on 8th floor. You get a complimentary glass of wine. All for \u20ac24 per person.\nTo me, it is not worth it. The building is the most beautiful \u2026",
          "Nice place to showcase the history of wine and the wide cepage types",
          "Very good. Worth a visit.",
          "Modern, fresh, evolving and end-to-end AMAZING experience. Highly recommended and an absolutely must see at  Bordeaux.",
          "Impressive use of technology. Enough activities to occupy us for many hours.",
          "The building itself and multimedia exhibitions are impressive. The degustation ticket is a scam - 10 Euro for 50g of wine. Better to take  a glass/bottle of wine in the Bacalan Hall, just opposite Cite du Vin.",
          "If you\u2019re coming to BORDEAUX, you need to take 2 to 3 hours to see this place !! Awesome!!",
          "Nice small museum, a must-see for wine lovers. Entrance: 5e for students and the wine tasting at the end was even better than the museum itself! Thanks to the welcoming team for the simple explanation of the long and complicated -for someone who knows too little about wine- history of the 'Bordelais'!",
          "Did the 1hr workshop, fairly interesting but a chateaux wine tour would be more enjoyable.",
          "Nice interactive exhibition. Beautiful museum",
          "It was a cool concept for a museum to be interactive, but it was poorly executed. My biggest complaint is that it isn't novice friendly. There were a lot of people there which made it difficult to do the interactive activities.",
          "Amazing workshop and wine tasting with Yamilla ! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and passion with us !",
          "Lots of fun and a free glass of wine with a view at the top!",
          "If you went to Bordeaux and you haven\u2019t paid a visit to the Wine Museum, you have to go back ! It is very well organized, you learn a lot of interesting stuff about wine in interactive ways and you can wrap the visit by tasting some wine while admiring the city view from the Belvedere level. Overall, an amazing experience !",
          "Bordeaux Wine Museum!!! Enjoyed a very nice experience here! Starting with outside  the design, which is very unique, that resembles a decanter. Inside is very interactive and informative. Allot ample time to engage everything, there's alot \u2026",
          "I\u2019m only giving it 4 stars because, as already something of a wine connoisseur I didn\u2019t learn anything new. The experience, however, was top notch, 5 stars. If you\u2019re new to the world of wine, its definitely a must!",
          "Beautiful architecture but I was dissapointed by the exibition.",
          "You have to really want to know the history of wine and hand a couple hours to spare, to truly enjoy this museum. A lot of work had been done to truly make this a high-end tourist attraction and it really is a fantastic museum, however, \u2026",
          "Le Cite du Vin is a very interesting take on the concept of a modern museum. The permanent exhibition is a sight to behold. Innovative and interesting. I don't like museums in general, but here we clearly have a work of art that doubles as a museum. So if in Bordeaux, make sure you check it out!",
          "Busy but very interesting and educational. Most parts were above expectations.",
          "Educational, and great use of technology to make the exhibits accessible to those of us with limited command of French. The building itself is worth the trip.",
          "Amazing and so interesting. So much do see and do. Very interactive!",
          "A must visit place for this world famous wine region. We thought we would spend 2-3 hours there and realize we could easily spend the whole day exploring the place. The museum takes you to the world of wine, through the rich history and \u2026",
          "Very nice museum on wine. The main expo is very accessible. Mostly composed of videos it will take you on an educational voyage. Plan to spend at least 3h there so you don't feel rushed. You can easily spend a full day if you want to see all the material.",
          "Good place to learn more about wine. 3-4 hours are necessary to go through all the interesting information. A restaurant with a good price value ratio is a must. There you have the chance to taste several Vin types in small/medium/large quantities. \ud83c\udf77",
          "Great ideas but several issues. The building is interesting and worth the entrance for 20 \u20ac (incl. glass of wine at the end). Snack bar food is poor, but decent drinks. Audio guides are horrible when it\u2019s busy (always dependent on persons \u2026",
          "Definitely where the true wine lover goes for their pilgrimage.",
          "Super, well worth the entrance fee, could spend hours here. Very interactive.",
          "very well planned, modern and educating wine promoting center, with a lot of thematically selected showcases. temporary exibition is less impressive. \nexpensive, to my taste :)",
          "Such stunning architecture and very fitting for the famed City of Wine. They\u2019ve made a lot of effort to capture the end to end experience of wine making, and it\u2019s such a pleasure to walk around the exhibition to learn more. Enjoy a casual \u2026",
          "Pros: building is cool, great view from top floor, lots of interactive exhibits, creative ideas. \n\nCons: Pretty overwhelming amount of info, would've appreciated a less random layout to better focus on my interests. Waiting for others to finish viewing something grew tiresome. Glass of wine at the Belvedere was skimpy and not great.",
          "Amazing views of Bordeaux and the exhibit is incredibly full of information in several languages. The interfaces are a touch confusing but worth figuring out.",
          "Cool museum, but parts were a bit cramped",
          "A beautiful modern museum about the history of wine, finished with a tasting at the terrace (8th floor) with a view to the city - wonderful experience, I just wished it was less screen-based, which makes me a bit to tired after a while!",
          "Great exhibition. Plan at least two hours for your visit and pre book online!",
          "Good museum but could be better",
          "Wonderful experience....need 5 hours to do a proper visit",
          "Perfect escape on rainy day",
          "It's an interesting structure and showcases nice contents but it is way too crowded and there are very long lines at the caf\u00e9.",
          "Nice museum about the region and wine / wine making process in general. It's a bit controversial to the area due to the expense of visiting, area and heavy multimedia influence. That said, the building design is really beautiful and modern \u2026",
          "I was so disappointed. A lot of work and research were done but the problem is that everything was awfully presented, there was zero organization. I think they should review it from scratch. Concerning the 8th floor, the view was normal and the staff were not so generous.",
          "Wine has been at the heart of civilisation. A feature of everyday life, a mainstay of social events, a symbol of celebration and sharing...",
          "Unless you're really into wines and a lot of details around it I don't recomend... the French are generally quiet pedantic about the food and drinks they produce so get ready for a full on explanation about wines which can take a long time. The building is great, so is the view though...",
          "Great museum to visit, a lot of info about wine. The entrance is 8 euro is worth, or 20 euro for  1 glass of wine at the 8th floor is too much (We thought it was wine tasting.)",
          "Wonderful experience for all wine lovers. Liked the history exhibit as well as the Smell experience.",
          "Housed in an extraordinary building accessible via the excellent tram system.  Very slick and professional exhibition which was very interesting and informative.  There are interactive exhibits - some were a bit hit and miss!\nAt the top of \u2026",
          "Very nice museum, with permanent exhibition and temporary one. You can go through the history of wine, from the very beginning to the modern time. There are videos with an interactive guide explaining you all the steps. For 20 eur you can \u2026",
          "Great talk on the history of AOC",
          "Very nice place if you want to learn about wine",
          "A must visit when in Bordeaux. The view from the restaurant on the 7th floor is a killer. The food at the restaurant was delicious especially the 'couteaux de petoncle' as a starter.",
          "It was really nice and the vine was teasty but it is expensive.",
          "It's a pleasant museum but over-priced, and the information is rather shallow and generic.",
          "Very cool wine museum. Interactive and informative. Could easily spend the whole day here.",
          "Nice building, i wouldn't suggest the ticket though",
          "It was a beautiful self guided tour.  And the staff was very helpful.",
          "Fun and informative, the upper tasting room has some nice views.",
          "The architecture is stunning and was worth going to look at the building purely from a design perspective. The shop had a good selection of quality gifts and there was a well stocked wine boutique. I bought a few nice gifts here for family \u2026",
          "20 euro at first I thought it was expensive, but considering the time it takes to see everything and the free wince glass, that\u2019s actually OK. At least half a day to ease everything",
          "Unexpectedly interesting.  A total surprise, exceptionally good!",
          "Fine place to visit. You get a free wine sample to drink with a view of the city.  Not a total tourist trap but it is not the Louvre either.",
          "Very high technology presenting about the wine.so impressive..people can drinking smelling touching talking  and listening everything about the wine.don't miss this place.",
          "As the most prominent wine attraction in one of the most well known wine regions in the world, I had some high expectations. Unfortunately I felt like this was a bit of a tourist trap, where the business of tasting wine is very expensive \u2026",
          "Great architecture. It's unfortunate that there is no ticket to visit the roof, you have to purchase a full and expensive exhibition+roof ticket, which was not what we wanted.",
          "We completed the introduction to wine course for 15 euros on the very first day we arrived. This is an awesome way to begin your stay in Bourdeaux especially if you are planning on visiting Saint Emillion and Medoc as it gives a great \u2026",
          "A must visit when you are around Bordeaux. A time and space travel into the history of wine. You should count around 3 to 4 hours in order to enjoy all the interactive display. At the end of the visit you can enjoy a nice glass of \ud83c\udf77 on the top of the city.",
          "A very immersive experience in all aspects of wine appreciation, the 4hrs that we stayed there was not long enough.",
          "Wine Castle, couldn\u2019t be better than this \ud83d\ude0d \ud83c\udf77 \nWas free entry for limited area, \nBut if you wanna explore everything there\u2019s entrance fee, but it\u2019s all worth it !",
          "If you don't know the basics about wine making then this is a great place to go. The building is amazing but the exhibit is lacking as it is only Audio Visual. Design for more of a video game generation. Not a lot of good facts and takeaways that someone who knows a little bit of wine wouldn't already know.",
          "A real must for wine lovers. Very educational and quite humorous. Where else can you drink with Voltaire and Napol\u00e9on when being serenaded by Mozart!",
          "It could have been a great experience... The building is beautiful and the idea of an interactive wine museum is great in this area. But. The permanent exhibition was weird... It would have taken very little effort to make it interesting, \u2026",
          "Gives a very thorough overview about all things wine in an interactive manner. Museum was crowded (overly so) and this has a negative effect on the visit.",
          "Very interactive experience where you can learn a lot about wines from all over the world",
          "A nice place to discover wine in all its forms: history, smelling, and tasting a glass at the end of the visit. Beautiful view at the top during your enjoying tasting by the way \ud83d\ude09\nA long and pleasant walk awaits you along the quays to the city center. Otherwise, given the distance, it will take the tram.",
          "Very good food, fresh local produce, the best wines in the world.",
          "This is a true celebration about the wine industry..not just  in France..but the whole world. It is a total class act and nothing like it anywhere else. A symbol of wine and life!",
          "Not actually a museum but an advertising \u201efoundation\u201c you have to pay 20\u20ac for. (Their words, not mine!)\u201eMulti-Media\u201d used out of laziness, with no benefit whatsoever. No information beyond buzzwords and stating the obvious or stereotypical \u2026",
          "Interesting architecture but too expensive,especially considering that one can by great wine all over France for way cheaper.",
          "I'm praying for some rain in California",
          "Great history and  anything you want to know about wine, plus buy and try. Wonderful place!",
          "Interesting place to visit. Wish the tour was more organized. Exhibits, while all focussed on the wine industry, was a little haphazardly arranged with no over riding theme.",
          "Exceptional museum, a real experience! Digital, instructive, fun, interesting, gorgeous and stylish. It was difficult to leave the exhibition... fortunately the glass of wine on the belv\u00e9d\u00e8re bar on the 8th floor is the perfect way to end the visit! Definitely recommend.",
          "Good to visit and have the fish marketing in front there. It is well organisation for inside the museum but it looks awful landscape and walking path surrounding.",
          "Cool museum. A must for wine lovers!",
          "Expensive for the experience. Not a WOW! In sight.",
          "We loved the experience and the story. It's a might fine building.",
          "Interesting but too much technology that causes media overdose :) amazing views.",
          "Interesting museum with lots of interactive experiences. Downside is that the full expatience of wine is not complemented with a more extensive tasting afterwards. One glass to confirm all you learned in the exposition is thin by any standard.",
          "Really great museum. The permanent exhibition can keep one busy for at least four hours.",
          "Lots of info on local and world wide viticulture.  Glass of wine included with entrance fee which you can sip while on the 8th floor viewing platform.  Exhibits are fun and interactive, but rather crushed with the large amount of visitors even in winter.  Good restaurant with views.",
          "You could happily spend half a day here if you want to learn about wine. There is a lot of info to take in. Maybe it's a good idea to break it in half by heading up the the deck to have your glass of wine included in the ticket. The ticket \u2026",
          "Excellent technology. The place is huge. Great interaction.",
          "Over-advertised and a little pricey. It's good, but personally I didn't feel like I learned more than I would have watching youtube videos. No prior wine knowledge (oenlogy) required, it picks up at zero. So if you already know a bit about wine you won't learn much.",
          "Conceptually the multi media is fantastic but I'm afraid it's fairly chaotic if crowded. While the touch info spot is great it doesn't work for a few 100 at a  time and nobody is willing to Q. It's definitely  worth a visit and is very \u2026",
          "If you came to bordeaux for vacation it's a worth of visiting this museum, especially if you love wine! \nIn the shop of the museum there are wines all over the world. \nThe view in the last floor is really fantastic, all over the city and the river.",
          "It is useless to go there.. Waste of time n money",
          "Excellent place to visit. Allocate a lot of time to see everything",
          "Good place to visit when in Bordeaux, easy to get to using the tram, which is fast and cheap.  Lots of different exhibits but when busy some can be difficult to access.  This is interesting but an hour and a half is probably long  enough. Building architecture is amazing as is the belvedere bar where you can receive a free wine sample.",
          "Very interesting museum and exhibition. Tasted M\u00e9doc vine. Very nice",
          "Best place to learn about wine and winery",
          "Huge place, you will need at least a full afternoon. Take your time and enjoy!",
          "A really great experience and way to spend time in Bordeaux, interesting and interactive exhibits, classes and delicious wine.",
          "No Real Ale sold here",
          "Excellent way to spend half a day",
          "Very interesting architecture and intriguing design of internal spaces. The 8th floor panoramic space is well intensified by mirrors. The use of bottles as ceiling decoration is too explicit for me.\nThe permanent exhibition on the second \u2026",
          "The price is very high for the musuem and interactive guide! I would personally prefer a vine yard visit with sommelier instead  \nThe Belvedere view and drink is the highlight :)",
          "Well it's not my cup of tea .but it was refreshing .to see ,a museum  of art .smell touch and hearing . The 5 sences  .the tasting area was closed to the public .and 20 e out of pocket .parking was difficult and just trying to find the way in .",
          "Beautiful place. An unforgettable experience.",
          "Very interactive place to be. We had 2 hours but only saw 50% so take your time to go there. Loved every minute but the glass of wine included in your ticket is disappointing and the staff up there at the 8th floor didn't care about giving information.",
          "Such a fun place! Spent two hours here and barely made a dent, so much to see and so much to learn. Must visit if in Bordeaux. Definitely make sure to head up to the top floor for a great view and wine tasting (included in ticket price)!",
          "Interactive fun, all about wine. Don't forget to go up to the 8th floor to catch the views and get the glass of wine included with the admission ticket.",
          "Extraordinary place to visit.",
          "If you do the main floor it starts pretty slow but gets really interesting. If you're doing it looking forward to the tasting portion, \"glass of wine\" just know they measure it with a thimble, the view isn't very nice and you can't buy \u2026",
          "Brilliant day out! Couldn't recommend more highly, it's an interactive museum with wine. What's not to love? The architecture is also incredible.",
          "Really interesting, not french centered. Our 10 years old daughter  liked it very much.",
          "Wonderful experience learning about wine around the world. The interactive exhibits were really informational and I enjoyed the history and influence in culture portion. At the end of the museum head up to the top floor to look at a panoramic view of Bordeaux while sipping on a taster of wine!",
          "We were on a wine \"Vineyard and Chateau\" Tour of Bordeaux and this was a perfect way to start it. Interactive and exhaustive history of wine and the process of making it. Gives great appreciation for how wine in intertwined with history. Don't miss this if you have ANY fondness for wine....OR history.",
          "Shows in his exhibition winemaking techniques from all over the World. The go to place in Bordeaux to get a broader understanding about Winemaking in all its aspects and also in a historical perspective. A good visit for Sundays since a lot \u2026",
          "Okay, I am not a huge fan of museums but this one is very very well designed. The museum is very interactive with an audio \u00ab guide \u00bb that works with the exhibits. It is not all about Bordeaux wines (in fact, surprising maybe not enough). \u2026",
          "A really great place, \n\nIt is a mine of information about wines all over the world. It is really interesting how it is brought to you. Through innovative way like globe manipulation, holograms, movies, models and so on. \n\nIt is a bit \u2026",
          "Great place to learn about history of vine and its infuluence on culture and life. Interactive exhibitions.",
          "Great experience",
          "Soul of the City of Wine. Wine cellar entry for free and museums and the rest for 20eur",
          "The permanent exhibition is quite good. Service on the wine tasting is awuful.",
          "good exhibit with interactive elements. reccomended for people that are sensory engaged",
          "Good display. Great views.",
          "Amazing, from basic to advance, from local to global, worth 2-3 hours easily",
          "The museum was very technical. The wine tasting little  it disappointed as we only could try one wine out of 12. The was very interesting history of Bordeaux wine. I think price should be reduced to \u20ac15.",
          "Good experiences, individually priced. Expect to spend 20-50\u20ac per person depending how much time and wine....",
          "Red wine warm ,white wine not cold enough, very poor for wine experts !",
          "fantastic visit. We only had 2.5 hours to spend there but would have loved to spend much more time. We will go again. Definitely worth the 25 Euros.",
          "Building is nice, but exhibition is too \"modern\" and hardly usable. You have audioguide with which you start various videos and presentations, but most of the time you come to one place in the middle of someone else watching it, so you have \u2026",
          "A complete travel in the wine culture! Definitely recommend! Courses, workshop, history, experience, wine, safety, food, good experience",
          "Not a normal museum. Interesting tech, but best thing is the smelling exhibits focusing on the flavour components in wine. Very good.",
          "Good show. You need more than 3 hours to look at everything....!",
          "Probably the best museum I've visited. An exciting building with fascinating, innovative and entertaining exhibitions, about wines produced world wide.",
          "This outstanding museum teaches everything you need to know about wine, it's surrounding culture and history in an amazing interactive museum. Thoroughly enjoyable for anyone of any age I highly recommend the visit it truly is an amazing \u2026",
          "This wine museum is so much more than that.  Great view of Bordeaux from the top floor (where you end your day with a small glass of wine, selected from many countries).  Le 7 restaurant is worth a visit (their weekday lunch special). But \u2026",
          "Great and interesting but not enough wine tasting!",
          "One of the \"things to do\" when visiting Bordeaux, interesting insight into how the wine business started and how it continues to survive. A great view to finish off the trip looking out over the town.",
          "Incredible Museum! Informative, hi-tech, stylish! Highly recommended!",
          "Very, very interesting visit...",
          "Great experience here. Highly recommend visiting this musuem before going on wine tours, especially if you're a wine novice like I am. The museum had a great layout with fantastic exhibits covering every aspect of wine from history to \u2026",
          "It's a very interesting museum. Demonstrations are well organized and presented in a very interesting way.",
          "So much to see!",
          "It is expensive to get in and if you are a group it can be very expensive. It is however interesting to walk around and see the exhibits and the history or wine making and vineyards around the world. There are many Interactive exhibits \u2026",
          "Bit disappointing. Good parts and bad. Be good for a wine novice",
          "A good place for the wine lover.",
          "Outside more attractive than inside",
          "The best wine museum ever! We did the temporary exhibit + permanent. The ticket price includes a glass of wine to enjoy at the top of the building with an outdoor balcony overlook. Fun, educational, very interactive.",
          "Worth going...everyone will tell you so...wasn't wrong.",
          "A really interesting place to visit. Go there if you love wines or if you just want to know something about wines. With or without kids.",
          "Good looking from the outside.inside is ok, nothing special. The temporary tour is a joke. There nothing to see or to know. Only few soil and rock samples and some old pictures. It should not be priced ticket, not even 1 EUR",
          "Fully enjoyed. Love this place. I could feel how French loves wine.",
          "Place to visit when you go to Bordeaux. GOT out knowing a lot more about Wine than when I entered",
          "Tasty wine and an unforgettable experience",
          "A fountain of knowledge in this venue Did not realise there was so much to learn about wines from throughout the world.  Respect to wineries. Only negative is the servers of the wine sample rush through the selection and if you don't like \u2026",
          "Very nice location to learn and admire something about wines.",
          "This place is like a crash course about wine.  *Everything* to do with wine.  Makes good use of audio and video combined with gesture recognition to communicate information. A visit is well worth it particularly if you are interested in the \u2026",
          "Positives:\nInteresting building. Nice view from bar. Aroma jars were very good. \nNegatives:\nEveryone keeps mentioning \"over ten hours of audio\" and that's the problem... It would be better if there was, for instance, 2 hours of audio that was well organised and edited.",
          "I didn't really like it. I found it expensive. Didn't like the shop either. I guess the building is a modern piece of art, but I didn't find it that impressive",
          "Nice place but the entrance is very expensive. The building is simply spectacular",
          "Some of it was good but if a point was busy you either waited ages to get on it is skipped a bit of the wine story. Amazing view from the top though@",
          "A very good place to visit, a place where you can come across different types and tastes of wine",
          "Very modern, informative and interactive. Good fun for kids, too.",
          "An 8\u20ac museum charging a 20\u20ac entrance fee. There are interesting tidbits but overall not worth the time or money. Very interesting mix of multimedia displays. Some are well done. We had technical issues with both of our automated tour \u2026",
          "Very good technology",
          "Wonderful place to discover Bordeaux's wine",

          "I'm not a wine connoisseur but I had a Bordeaux City Pass for the day which included free admission prior to 12 noon which saved me \u20ac20. I took the tram to the end of the line and then walked a short distance to the Wine museum. There's \u2026",
          "Sadly, my time at the La Cite du Vin museum, was poor...the worst museum I have ever experienced, anywhere in the world.\n\nWhy so poor?\n\n1. The audio headsets provided by the museum, do not cover your ears, so you can hear the sounds around \u2026",
          "Didn't go in - looked ersatz and costly. Contrivance.",
          "If you are a wine lover, this is the museum for you. You can find anything about wine - the history of wine, how wines are produces, types of wines, wine regions around the globe, etc. The museum has some interactive exhibits and you also \u2026",
          "Wonderful place. Everything you every wanted to know about wine. Great presentations and you get a tasting too!",
          "The museum is okay! Its clean and we'll designed. There are lockers to  store bags which was nice! I would recommend not going during peak hours. There are headsets needed to interact with the exhibits and if there are a bunch of people it \u2026",

          "Interesting museum of wine, lots going on to keep you entertained",
          "Excellent museum. You can spend the day there. If you stay nearby I recommend you go there a few times as there is too much to see in only one visit",
          "Restaurant at 7th floor has a delicious meals and fantastic view!",
          "This is a very modern approach to creating a museum from no actual permanent collection. The audioguide doesn't always work seemlessly but it is a good way to enhance the visit. Enjoyed the immersive visualisations. Thought twenty euros was quite high as a price point though.",

          "The building is nice and the views from the top are quite good, but as it's far from the city center they're not as spectacular as one can expect. In addition, to get to the top (level 8) you must pay the ticket for the museum+tour. If not, you can go to the restaurant (level 7) with good views also, but paying the service.",
          "I would like to go 3.5 stars. It's a nice museum with interactive exhibits, but it's heavy on the history and wine's place in society. There are some interesting workshops that cost extra.",
          "Very high tech but not everything works as it should. Many videos that are not very informative and rather childish. Could be selected better for a better rounded experience. A bit pricey for the experience as well. Half the price would be \u2026",
          "Beautiful building architecture but message somehow secondary",
          "Cool interactive exhibits but working with them is not very intuitive. Would recommend buying a few extra tastings for your time on the observation deck as each ticket only come with a single glass. There are many wines from many countries to choose from and it feels like you\u2019re missing out to not get to try at least a few.",
          "Lots to see, very interesting place to visit.",
          "Fairly good and worth going.  Interactive exhibits are slow and awkward when crowded",
          "Really a great museum about wines and vines in a futuristic building. It's about 2.5 km far from the centre but there's a nice walk along the river to get there. A lot of interesting videos and interactive material, you could easily stay \u2026",
          "Spectacular modern building housing temporary and permanent exhibits.  We only visited the temporary show featuring music related to wine.  Interesting!  There is a restaurant at the top of the building with great views, but the cafe is on the ground floor.",

          "On all the tourist guides (online and otherwise) list of the top things to do in Bordeaux is a visit to the Cite Du Vin, housed in an impressive building on the riverbank and a monument to all things wine.  It covers the history of wine, \u2026",

          "Excellent visit  nice drinks afterwards too",
          "So much to see, read and smell. 2,5 hour was way too short for us. It is quite pricy to enter I think, but with discount we decided to give it a shot. Then it was a pity we had to catch a flight, so we could not stay longer. Could have been a full day trip in our case.",
          "I thought it would be a short one hour visit but the creativity that they put in curating the different aspects in wine production, history and culture was actually interesting enough that you would stay longer.",
          "Absolutely love this museum! It's interactive, fascinating, and the staff is very helpful  You'll learn a lot about wine from its rich history to identitying various types!",
          "This museum is ok. The technology is fairly advanced but doesn\u2019t really work with crowds of people. Even with the student discount I felt the price was fairly high given the museum exhibits and singular wine tasting.",
          "Great day out - you get your own headset which you scan for each information point in your own language which was really interesting (which we might not have done if it wasn't free). You also get a free glass of wine with your ticket!",
          "The interactive bits are great but some other bits were a bit long",
          "This place is simply amazing. Really interesting exhibition with a digital assistant that works... Most of the time. The interactive items are so well done and the wine tasting is a nice feature. The food situation is weird. Either high class or burgers. Nothing in between.",
          "Lovely place. Pity about the rude security guard outside. Does not care about tourists, more interested in giving out about his job and having to deal with tourists. A little bit of manners goes a long way.",
          "Had a hellova experience at the Cite Du Vin. Crashed my drone on top of the museum and I had to hire a climber, who requested to be paid in wine, to retrieve the drone. The police were called and the drone ended up being destroyed due to \u2026",
          "Interesting and good interactive experience, but the temporary exhibition was rubbish",
          "A good place to learn how wine has evolved and flourished since thousands of years, and what different influences have shaped it.  Note that there are no wine tasting facilities as part of the standard offerings.  We later found a shop downtown that could sample 1-35\u20ac tastes of typical to expensive collector wines called Max.",
          "Great experience.",
          "Only interesting if you don't know anything about wine... the best part is the shop where you can find wines from all over the world.",
          "The building itself is already very interesting and attractive. the exhibits are highly  interactive and interesting. It'd be great if there is English workshop but as I visited in October,  only French ones are organized.  It shall worth joining one.",
          "In vinas veritas...",
          "Very nice. Good place to visit.",
          "I find wine fascinating.  This place was over the top in a a good way.  I spent the full day here and forgot to leave room for the free wine tasting on the top floor.  :(  You can\u2019t leave Bordeaux without spending some time here.  If anything, head straight to the interactive displays.",
          "One of the best museums ever. It's great to learn about wines from around the world, sample some and purchase from a huge range. Innovative interactive displays to help understand wine colour, taste, smell, texture and so on. About \u20ac20 per person.",
          "The place that you must visit while you're in Bordeaux. You will find not just a culture of wine but even all sorts of wines from all over the world in the store.",
          "Prefect for anyone that loves food, pork, duck, wine or beer. Not that great for vegans.",
          "First of all i expected the museum to be bigger. However everything has been done very nicely. Most things are interactive like talking to virtual wine makers and you'll get a device which will tell you stories about objects or show you \u2026",
          "Spend your money on a vineyard tour instead. \n\nThe two tables where you can smell the different aromas of the different wines are interesting (although I know what chocolate smells like, so I'm not sure why smelling it through a copper tube \u2026",
          "Extremely well presented and enticing deplays\n Lots of information.",
          "Really good food but the tour was very boring",
          "Love how interactive it is but being crowded makes it hard to get around and see everything. Also, some wine tastings throughout would have been nice!",
          "It\u2019s good. The museum is quite modern, but it was a bit too crowded. At the end you can try one wine of your choice.",
          "Interesting place to visit even without a deep interest in wine.\nIt's all indoors so good for a rainy day.\nAdmission includes a glass of wine which is nice and enjoyed with a great view up on the 8th floor.\n\nThe closest V3 station was full when I arrived. The next closest is not far - about five mins walk.",
          "Interesting mus\u00e9e with everything you need to know about wine",
          "If you do the self tour, you get a head set that allows you to choose your preferred language. You just point it at whatever you want to hear about. It's all very interactive and you get a glass of wine at the end! Of you have a City Pass, it's free if you get there before noon.",
          "Good bt too costly for 1 personne 20 Euro too taste wine",
          "Great place for wine lovers. Plan some time. Only for the permanent tour you can spend 3 hours.",
          "Interactive museum.  Worth putting a few hours aside for.",
          "Good education center, fun tasting experience, and wine shop.",
          "Strongly recommended. On top of the rich and super interesting materials presented. You get to listen, watch, interact, smell and immerse yourself in artistic visuals.\n\nThe technology is amazing - and by itself is an amazing experience. \u2026",
          "Lovely place",
          "Not worth the visit. It can't be considered a museum since it's made of a rather limited, fully multimedia exhibition that does not justify the \u20ac20 entrance in any possible way. All you are going to see is a poorly organised collection of \u2026",
          "Cleverly designed to combine seriousness and light hearted moments. Absolutely worth a visit. Special tablet guide for children too!",
          "The best wine museum I have ever visited. The interactive exhibits are very good.",
          "Disappointed. For children only. I expected to find out something new about the wine (how to taste properly, how to distinguish the color, something about the smell, how it\u2019s made- well at least some useful information)but there was noting except nice pictures.",
          "Amazing building.  Interactive and educational displays.  View of the city from the observation deck",
          "Cool place but didnt make  us taste any wine",
          "Amazing experience!",
          "Amazing place. You should stay full day if poss. There is so much to see which is why the ticket price is worth it. Also you get a free glass of wine on the top level. We're not big on wine but really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Really great understanding of how wine is produced and the differences between different types or wine, bottle and production styles. Very insightful.",
          "Very interesting and impressive exhibition. I love the part where you smell the perfume notes. The wine is great as you can expect from a such place. The view is gorgeous as well.",
          "Wish I\u2019d spent my 20\u20ac on wine rather than on this museum. \nNo written content and using the \u2018high-tech\u2019 audio displays felt like a barrier to any enjoyment.\nLeft after 30mins feeling ripped off.",
          "Very cultural, great experience!",
          "Don't understand why only has 4. For foreign visitors, the large variety of languages in wine explanations is such hard to find anywhere else in France. The knowledge is not that in details but in a very wide range, not only about Bordeaux \u2026",
          "Interesting building.  Tram b goes straight there.  Parts of museum were very good e.g. smelling section and history of wine holograms, but it is only 1 floor.  Included glass of wine on 8th floor was below average quality and we had 4 different options. Good view though.",
          "You can be a total expert in wine after this awsome digitalized museum. Brilliant experience. Get an audio guide and listen to everything. You will be able to taste and smell wine THE right way.",
          "Great visit! A must-stop in Bordeaux!",
          "Great!",
          "Nice architecture, but the visit is not worth the money. The exhibition is disappointing, especially when you have expectations to learn more. Overcrowded.",
          "Amazing place to know the history of wine, scent all posible scents a wine can have, and enjoy a beaytiful view of Bordeaux city river. Me and my wife spent around 2 hours and only explored a part of the museum. There are many audiovisual \u2026",
          "Great if you're interested in the history of wine and its various regions. Wine tasting on the top floor offers a great view but for the hefty price you're only afforded one taster. Shop on the lower level is very expensive.",
          "Great experience.",
          "View was OK, many many many vine Infos. Interesting presentation techniques. Nice place for technical enthusiasts",
          "Good wine classes",
          "Entertaining and informative, athough I found it difficult to actually learn and retain knowledge, as technology can be distractive. I would recommend classes at l'\u00e9cole du vin and \u00e0 good book instead.",
          "The best museum of wine I ever visit, and museums in general is the masterpiece. Looks like modern but made of wood. Place ro visit in Bordeaux as must"

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "Close to the centre of Bordeaux and the main tram station. A spectacular fountain that was rebuilt after the war includes lots of sculptures of horses but worth a visit and a photo opportunity.",
          "Great photo opportunities. Lots of different elements to take in. An easy walk from anywhere downtown.",
          "Amazing pieces of art which were removed in 1943 and returned in 1944. pictures can be seen in the Museum Aquitaine ...",
          "The monument is well worth your time spent viewing it. There is information regarding it. We sent atleast an hour of our day there.",
          "A fantastic fountain to take pictures of. Looks great during night or early morning. Has a lot of details and is very impressive",
          "Not sure of the history behind this monument but it was pretty spectacular with its grandiose horses and spouts....reminded me of Napoleon....sure he had something to do with it.",
          "We came across this amazing very large sculpture during our day strolling around Bordeaux. It's well worth a visit, and has very interesting links to the course of the French Revolution and Bordeaux's role in it.",
          "Wow this is an amazing bit of sculpture! Really stunning, you can\u2019t stop looking at all its features and then you see the back is just as impressive. Great to have some funny photos taken if nothing else!",
          "As we walked closer, the Monument seemed to grow in size. Only close in did the other side appear. Many beautiful sculptures and figures of lions, humans, and fish. It is very tall and well lighted in the evenings. We stayed about twenty minutes to look and walk around all",
          "we went on a walking tour and met here, interesting history of the monument and probably a must see.",
          "Absolutely stunning fountain and a must to see, easy to visit as it is very central. Go early morning as you can take photos before the crowds arrive.",
          "The kids liked it and asked taking pictures... A beatiful fountain. The images are interesting. Nearby there is a gorgeous trees boulevard.",
          "Bordeaux was all we expected ( having just seen it of a Rick Stein programme) It is stunningly beautiful, with gorgeous buildings and a lovely waterfront I chose the this monument and fountain as it was one of the first places we really stopped to look at With its mythological",
          "I loved it!! It seems to me is a complet, perfect, wonderfull monument!! Is like a perfect love story , like a beatifull dream!! Is lovely in the sunset, and becouse it was so nice i visit it again in the next day on the perfect light !! Big , complet, with many details . You",
          "A beautiful monument that is even more interesting when you have a guide o explain it. Can even go inside on certain Sundays.",
          "What a fantatsic display and fun area to relax by/around for all the family. Cool water spraying everywhere but is very tempting to step into pool areas to cool off but Gendarmes watching carefully!",
          "So, this is just a fountain, but the sculpture of the fountain is grand, interesting, and moving. It was not far from the water mirror (by European walking standards anyway). We were just walking around when we came across this monument, so that probably made the experience even",
          "This was so close to our hotel so we headed straight to it after we got settled. One of the coolest fountains I've ever seen. There is so much to take in we walked around it 3 times!",
          "the area around the square is pleasant and the fountain absolutely great. When visiting bordeaux you cannot miss it.",
          "I was impressed by this fountain. I saw many in my life and this fountain is really unique and grand. I took lots of photos from the both sides of it to remember in details. Find it and you will enjoy the view!",
          "Set back from the river this monument is magnificent. Especially the statues and fountains at the base.",
          "Well worth taking this impressive sight in during your trip round Bordeaux. And of course make sure you take the obligatory photo of the column coming out of your partner\u2019s head!",
          "This is a must see monument if you are visiting Bordeaux. It is full of grandeur & can be seen from many places in the town. A truly unique fountain of 2 halves, with a statue of Liberty breaking chains atop a large central pillar. Check it out.",
          "We were very lucky to have this as part of a walking tour so all the various aspects of the fountain and the many details were explained to us which really brought it to life. This was taken by the Germans in WW2 but smuggled back the Resistance and then of back together and",
          "Very striking monument whether by day or night and worth visiting because it is a monument to those who tried to advocate a peaceful form of Revolution and ended up losing their own lives. The fountain is lucky to have survived - being been taken apart and hidden during the war",
          "This looks like your usual monument and fountains but stay awhile and look again! It's worth it. Reading the plaque, tells us that apparently they 'lost' the bronze horses for scrap in 1944 and they were due to be melted down but heyho - they were found! They were restored and",
          "Placed in the beautiful of Quinconces, highlighted in a large and sandy square, is a landmark of Bordeaux, and of the very France. After all, it is an architectural and artistical memory of Girondines roll in the French history. By the way, the scupulteres by themselves, have",
          "Detailed bronze designs in this fountain make for a very attractive photo opportunity. Right at the end of the enormous Parc de Girondins by the river a very short walk from the tourist office.",
          "The monument has amazing bronze sculptures of horses that seem to be galloping through the water fountain, alongside with the troops. The column raises and carries a statue representing \"the spirit of liberty\". This place was erected as a memory of the French Revolution. A",
          "One of the most beautiful fountains I\u2019ve seen and loaded with meaning (make sure to get a guide or read about it online). Well worth the visit.",
          "The place, the monument and the surrounding shaded alleys should not be missed on every city tour. Easy walking distance from pont de pierre and place de la bourse.",
          "It was a boiling hot day when I saw this and the fountains were a blessed relief. I learned later the whole statues, I believe in various parts were ordered to be melted down to make weapons etc during the war but after being dismantled someone managed to hide them until the war",
          "This remarkable, imposing, and artistically crafted monument of the moderate Girondins, who resisted the inception of the inception of the Reign of Terror, is a fitting tribute to their sacrifice, one that should be saluted and remembered. The majestic power of the bronze and",
          "A good place to pick up some interesting French history. The Monument is to leading men from the area who were killed during the French Revolution. Centrally located and easy to find. There's a big, rather dry and dusty area between the monument and the river. Not much by",
          "One of my favourite places in Bordeaux (and I live here). This fountain is simply amazing and never fails to impress.",
          "worth walking all around it. Beautiful architecture,amazing details. The fountain is wonderful on its every angle",
          "The statues of sea horses and people on either side of the Statue of Liberty in Quinconces, are very centrally located and can easily be visited. I would recommend you to go near and admire the beautiful statues in detail, especially the sea horses. The statue was fortunately",
          "This is a weird fountain and for that reason alone it is worth seeing. It was hot when I was there and people were swimming in it. Good to read the story behind it as it makes the fountain come together. Takes 15 minutes to see and is in walking distance to a lot of sights.",
          "A truly magnificent memorial. There are some bi-lingual plaques to give you some historic background. The level of detail is lovely, with variations on either side.",
          "Not withstanding the beauty of Bordeaux, this monument is amazing. The majesty of the monument with all the various figurines is admirable. One cannot just standby and admire the fountain.",
          "Definitely an interesting monument to go visit. It\u2019s fascinating all the different characters that surround this towering monument. Fountains flowing on both sides.",
          "A very big statue with a horse in the middle and some water spraying around it! No need to go Close by you see it better in a distance!",
          "The richness of decoration of the characters at the base of the column is revealed when looking at the fountain close by. The glamorous monument was built where the historically significant Trompette castle stood for centuries reminding of the English reign, best to be forgotten",
          "This monument sits proudly at the apex close to the center of Bordeaux. Looks like the Trevi Fountain! This is another must see. Recommended.",
          "The history of France is right here! The struggles, revolution, re-building and looking to the future with education and hard work. Gorgeous but do much more! Breaking the chains of oppression! Liberty!",
          "Whilst ambling around Bordeaux taking in the various sights we stumbles upon this Structure. We grabbed a coffee and marveled at the architectual brilliance and engineering that makes this a 'water fountain'. So many things to see whilst walking round it.... Well worth seeing",
          "As we were walking away from the center of town we encountered this amazing fountain. It is dedicated to the French revolution. The sculpted figures are fantastic.",
          "Lots of history behind this monument, not least of which connected with the Nazi occupation and the resistance hiding the statues so they could not be melted down for armaments and only re-erected in the last ten years. A good meeting point as it's next to place de quinconces",
          "Located near the tourist information centre is this amazing monument to the Girondin faction of the French Revolution",
          "You cannot miss noticing this huge monument when walking or driving on the main water-front promenade of Bordeaux. Nice place for some photos",
          "Unfortunately construction around it, but it is very well preserved monument. Nice historic site to visit.",
          "Located next to the Quinconces tram stop & the daily flea market this monument takes you breath away.",
          "Lovely piece of architecture and it is certainly worth seeing but why are the fountains not spraying water,it appears that most of them in the city have no water running at this time.",
          "The Monument aux Girondins is a spectacular double statue on either side of a column commemorating the Girondin faction during the French Revolution and by extension the people of the region. It is at the Place de Quinconces in central Bordeaux and forms one of the major icons",
          "The work on this fountain is really good but the fountain wasn't running in March. From the photos of it that I have seen from our friends this is really fantastic when the water is running. But even when it is cold this is nice to see and it would be better if there wasn't a",
          "Bordeaux was one of our 2018 cruise stops... and Monument aux Girondins was an absolute highlight of our two-day stay!",
          "A most impressive sight to which we were taken by our guide; we had the advantage of good weather and blue skies which enhanced our photo-opportunities. Impressive.",
          "I can imagine this must be an impressive sight in summer when the fountains are in operation. However in April they were not - there are some stroking statues: the Girondins were a faction within the revolutionary assemblies. Another issue that detracts from the monument is the",
          "This statue is really very impressive, details worth seeing the very closely. Unuckily we were missing water inside of fountain and in the square there were carusels.",
          "It's a beautiful impressive monument, with fountains and great sculptures. It's on par with the beautiful monument in Lyon. Walking around the monument will give you a great feel of the splendor of it.",
          "When we were in Bordeaux, they had a catnip going on near the monument. So it wasn\u2019t tremendously peaceful, but it was a nice place to stroll. And the fountains are elaborate and intricate and interesting. A short walk, and you\u2019re near all the shopping, the Opera, and more.",
          "This is ideal for when you want an explore and to stretch your legs after being in a hotel. Has a wonderful atmosphere, a very fun place to visit would definitely recommend.",
          "The life and animation that is captured in these two great tableaux is totally stunning. At first glance, the two sides are similar but everything is different. Look for the details",
          "This historical fountain is massive and impressive. The different angles of this structure are very detailed and most interesting.",
          "Our tour guide talked here for quite a while. Fascinating history of Bordeaux and an intereting fountain monument.",
          "Right by the tram stop on the way into town, very cool and nice to have a walk around early morning.",
          "One of the \"must see\" places of Bordeaux, the fountains are truly amazing and you will be hard pressed to take a few dozen pictures here",
          "A most stunning monument to people during the French Revolution. It is a strong, forceful tribute and well worth taking a short detour to view",
          "Fascinating monument, with so many figures of people and horses. There is so much detail that it's hard to take it all in. Take some time to walk slowly around to each of the four sides. There is so much history represented here. The sculptures are really fantastic. We",
          "It is in a park and is a very nice looking monument with all th fountains spraying water it woth looking at when going by",
          "This large and beautiful fountain, close to the city centre, is well worth a visit and offers a great photo op. The sculptural work is elaborate, dramatic, and very striking, although the surrounding square is bland and unimpressive.",
          "Wowie! I could spend several hours just drinking this all in. The visuals are mind-numbing. Where to start? How about the horses with bird-like claws ... our guide says the horses are reverting to the sea. Okay, that works for me. On top of a very tall column is a lovely",
          "A magnificent fountain within walking distance to city centre and at no cost. Pity about the surrounds but its worth seeing.",
          "really cool monument. great stop while you're walking around the city. near the transit center, just a short walk from the Water Mirror.",
          "What an amazing structure with a very interesting history. I would expect to come across something like this in Rome or Paris ; not Bordeaux.",
          "Incredible fountain and figures..beautiful sight and fascinating history..well worth visiting..incredible detail!",
          "Came on a beautiful sunny day and went on a walking tour to see the sights of Bordeaux. This large water fountain with monuments is a well worth a stop.",
          "This one beats Rome, Paris and London hands down! The Girondins in many ways represented a lot what this city has stood for through the centuries and that shows. The Bordelais really have pulled out all the stops to honor their past heroes...we were impressed!",
          "Buy a week long tram ticket which will enable you to use trams,bat boat and buses Also useful to return to airport.Costs approx. 7 euros,well worth it.",
          "Two large sculptures on each side make this a fantastic place for photos .There isnt really enough information about the actual figures but it is spectacular none the less.",
          "This impressive monument would be minus much if the resistance had hidden the metal from the Germans. Hooray! Stand well back and it looks even more impressive. Well worth some photos when on a visit to Bordeaux",
          "This was a surprise to us as we walked up from the river! When we took a guided tour in the afternoon it was explained to us and the history makes it even more remarkable. Great that the iron fountain was not melted down for theGermans.",
          "We were walking around Brodeaux and did stop by the fountain, walking distance from the river and the shopping district. Lots of water, good photo ops",
          "Loved this monument and fountain. Returned twice just to gaze at all the sculptures in the fountains and to admire the view across the square towards the river",
          "On the edge of the old town and close to the public gardens, worth a detour to see this very elaborate monument",
          "This was very beautiful to look at. It was such a hot day when I visited two weeks ago that I was tempted to climb the short fence and jump in! There is also a staircase to climb to see the fountain from a different angle and also another set on the opposite side that provides",
          "The sculptures of that fountain are very nice and have a nice story to tell. Located on a large square, close to the st Catherine street and the river, must take a look.",
          "We took the tram from Pessac where we were staying. Always a good way to see a city then you can choose where and when you want to get off. This was one of our stops. Fabulous fountain and monument. A must see",
          "Very impressive sculpture but unless you\u2019re specifically visiting fountains and monuments it\u2019s not somewhere to had for specifically. The open space wasn\u2019t used for anything while we visited but could be great for many things.",
          "Saw this from a distance as it was about 39 degrees and no shade but I am sure you would get a shower on windy day.",
          "There is a really nice walk along the river in this city of nice walks. This walk is ideal near the end of day when the locals are picnicking in the flower park or jogging along the river, children playing in Le Miroir d'eau. We started near the Porte Cailhau walked pass the",
          "The monument has great features and history. The large square is just an open area with little shade. However it\u2019s easy to find from train station and with a car park are (which is shaded) its a great place to start your Bordeaux tour. There is a main square with cafes,",
          "This is a remarkable, spectacular fountain with so much details standing at the end of a big park, on the opposite side from the Garonne river and the ferris wheel. It commemorates all the fallen Girondins who gave their lives during the French revolution. The fountain is split",
          "The fountain is huge, actually two fountains linked together with gigantic statues of revolution heroes and horses and children. You want to jump in on a hot day. But at least when there is even a bit of wind you can get water spray by climbing up the stairs. Want to look at",
          "A beautiful and very impressive water feature - the only downside was that we couldn't jump in and splash around in the 30 degree heat of summer!",
          "This fountain was top of my 'to see' list when we visited recently and it did not disappoint. It was stunning to see in real life and lived up to my expectations.",
          "This magnificent fountain is very special to the people of Bordeaux as it tells the story of locals who died in the revolution. The fountain itself tells many stories and has an array of great works of art.",
          "The detail of the horses and bronze figures is wonderful and it is on Place Quinconces with a big wheel at the other end of the square",
          "Even walking around this monument slowly and you still won't see every bit of its magnificent detail.",
          "A really impressive fountain, complex in structure but a beautiful piece of art telling of a very interesting history.",
          "Well worth a visit as its a very impressive monument however I wish we had done a little homework on its history before visiting.",
          "Very impressive monument in Bordeaux, it is well worth studying the history of this before visiting or at least at the time. The fountains I believe close down in winter or times of frost.",
          "Really lovely fountain , lots of good photo opportunities . Kids can paddle in it . The surrounding area used to be green but now looks like a car park so not as nice",
          "Lovely monument with magnificent statues and fountains. Tells an interesting story about the fate of the Girondins following the Revolution.",
          "Worth a trip by this beauty! Currently some construction going on along the road but doesn\u2019t interfere very much. Get close. Study the details in this great monument.",
          "Lovely attraction, walking distance from the river, easy to get to and from. Great stop on a hot summer's day, to have a sit down and enjoy the monument",
          "Go with a guide, read the plaques, see the detail in the sculptures, zoom in on the Liberte. So much to absorb here. Vive la liberte!",
          "The Monument aux Girondins is located on Esplanade des Quinconces. Its prominent position in the park made it be easily found from all sides. It is right next to the trams terminus and not too far from the Grand Theater. There are a number of impressive sculptures around the",
          "No charge to see this monument but once you have admired the impressive sculptures and the water fountains associated with it, that's about it. Easily found near the Quinconces bus and tram terminus and a short walk from the Intercontinental Hotel.",
          "In a very prominent position and easily viewed from all sides. It would have been nice if there had been some seating nearby. There was plenty of space for seats but none to be seen.",
          "In the winter it's shut off so the water isn't flowing. In May right now there is no carnival or distracting backgrounds, it's just the monument and there is so much about it to see. Not one statue is alike on either side.",
          "Definitely take a quick pitstop here to see this historical monument. It is absolutely beautiful with an interesting history. Read the placards to appreciate how lucky we are to still have this around.",
          "Nice to see this beautiful monument with water fountains. Plenty of tourists taking photos and many coach parties passing through.",
          "Spectacular monument in central Bordeaux City, just off the river promenade. There is a semi annual open antiques market adjacent to it.",
          "Lovely park down by the river. On the Saturday of my visit there was an antique market taking place with lots of very interesting stalls. I even purchased a small item and had fun bartering.",
          "i was very surprised by the size of this fountain i remimbered the fountain in Rome felt that I should drop a coin so that I would return. the horses are so beautiful the entire fountain is a sceptical This fountain and the tower column erected was to honour the Girondin",
          "A grand and dramatic monument with an interesting wartime history -- currently surrounded by road/tram works and a lot of dust. Don't drink the water.",
          "Two sides with a ton of details, much to see. I wish there was more info. To think this was almost destroyed by the Nazis.",
          "It was worth seeing because we were in the area but I was more excited to see the huge antique/flee market that is right next to it. Allot of interesting furniture, art, tools, toys, clothes in 4 long rows with dealers on both sides",
          "Must see fountain with beautiful statues. Generally quite busy in the area and there is currently construction going on by it.",
          "We are very lucky to be able to see those more than beautiful fontains because in the second war the Germans decided to move those beautiful two. The decided to melt them to form weapons but the war was at the end and they moved back them in France.",
          "Near antics market area beautiful and impressive monument. Lot of antic shopping possibilities and snacks.",
          "Came across this on Sunday as we wandered around the Antique Fair area. A lot of detail in the sculptures and really good to have a plaque in English telling you the history of them.",
          "The fountain was not far from shopping area. Nice backdrop for pictures. Looks like the city was setting up for an open air market near the fountain,",
          "Right in the centre at the front of the park and surrounded by cafes. There was also a flea/antique market to wander around which was quite interesting.",
          "a monumental fountain complete with column like the one at the Bastille in Paris, topped with Freedom statue, surrounded by allegorical figures on each side, the French rooster, bas-reliefs of Bacchus, god of wine. You need a guide to explain who is who - and maybe you will get",
          "This a truly extraordinary monument to the 22 members of the National Assembly executed in 1792. On opposite sides, bronze horse-fish of amazing liveliness are captured leaping from the water, pulling a chariot, and about to crush figures representing Lie, Ignorance and Vice.",
          "Another must see. Grab a bottle of wine and some snacks and sit in the park to enjoy this beautiful sculpture.",
          "Don't miss, great they found the horses in Angers after the way. You see this column from so many angle framed by the streets that emerge from Place des Quinconces. created between 1894 and 1902 in honour of the Girondins, a group of moderate, bourgeois National Assembly",
          "Winter is hard on water features. Along with the Water Mirror this fountain was waterless. This fountain however looks amazing even without its jets of water. Beautiful detail in the men and Cupids and numerous hippocampus.",
          "what a mess... as important it may be, and as impressive it is as a piece of work, it's really a mess. who would want something like that in his/her garden?",
          "There\u2019s no water in the fountain so it looks less spectacular than when it would have water inside. However the sculpture is very interesting.",
          "Late in posting this review, in August the fountains were going full force. Surely it isn't the same here without water,",
          "We visited in March. I really wish that the fountains would have been on! Not sure exactly why they weren't. I am sure it is a much more spectacular sight to see when it is operating but nevertheless beautiful.",
          "It's a beautiful fountain with nice sculpture, however with not much else nearby, it's a bit out of the way. We visited in the summer, and due to the heat, there were some naked teens & children playing in the fountain water. We thought it was funny, however the police did not,",
          "We were unlucky to have bad weather and no water but still the fountain iss beautiful and everything about it is stunning i want to go back and take more pics as i was in a hurry i could not appreciaate it properly. Cant wait to see it again one day",
          "Challenge to get a good photo and not to get sprayed. Many different angles to take. Good access from all sides.",
          "Has a great story about how a railworker stole rail car from germans with statue inside of car to keep it in France",
          "We came to see the fountains when it was already dark. What an impressive and glorious sight! Figures spouting jets of water everywhere in a truly magical display. A monument to those beheaded, I believe, by Robespierre.",
          "This is an interesting monument with lots of interesting details, once you stop to look closely. What initially appear to be horses are actually some mythical creatures that are part horse, part fish, part sea creature. The hooves have 'fins' on them and their rear ends are",
          "The fountain is large, impressive and beautiful. A month long festival/fair was going on next to the fountain which detracted from the atmosphere.",
          "I never knew the history of the massacre of the Girondins until the tour guide in our TukTuk related it. It was genocide. This monument was built to commemorate those who were killed. When I was there, a fair occupied the whole of the Esplanade des Quinconces, rather obscuring",
          "I loved seeing the fountain and walking around it both during the day and at night. It is beautiful!",
          "Simply a very stunning monument in the heart of Bordeaux, it's well worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "A great fountain, with whimsical creatures, horses, and mankind. On a sunny day the photos are great. The monument is located right beside a big square, where a local fair company was setting up its rides when we were there in late September.",
          "A really over the top monument and fountain. It is spectacular and well worth a stroll around. I visited early in the morning, when few people were around and enjoyed the peace and quiet. Later in the day it was busier and noisier, but still worth a visit.",
          "The history behind this monument is more interesting than the monument itself as it is a tribute to the local revolutionists who were killed by the Robbespierre faction.",
          "A lovely and impressive fountain dedicated to founders of the revolution, it was nearly lost during WWII and sold for scrap. Restored after it was found in a store house after the war, it is truly grand and quite well located to other tourist attractions.",
          "This is a dramatic set of sculptures, flowing water, and an impressive tower that attracts tourists and locals as well. Worth spending a half hour marveling at it.",
          "There are so many details and so many symbols that if you read up a little before visiting, you get more out of what you're looking at. You can check out the visitor's information site or even Wiki will help.",
          "I recommend that you go and have a real close look at this monument as the detail is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring - I could have stood for so much longer and just looked at this without a problem It is just eerie that it is in a huge expanse with nothing else there",
          "By any standards this is magnificent fountain to the memory of the Girondins and revolutionary France. Spectacular horses rear, water splashes and a heroic column dominates the scene. Its impressive and visually stunning....",
          "Just beautiful with wonderful activity around this monument. Made for a quite walk around. We enjoyed this on a Sunday with lots of family enjoying the area.",
          "Intricate monument with great fountains and night time lighting, subdued rather than spectacular but never the less interesting. A good place to meet up before town.",
          "This took 8 years to build and when you look at it that is not surprising although why build a monument to the Girondins who were done over in the reign of terror over 100 years before. Presumably it was a statement of French nationality in the Eurpoean hotbed pre First World",
          "The Monument aux Girondins is a very intricate and interesting statue in a much larger garden. The garden is unique due to the pattern of the tree planting; the statue is interesting for a whole host of reasons. To me, the most fascinating historical aspect of the statue",
          "This is a magnificent monument to remember those who have lost their lives during the French Revolution when those who opposed to behead the king and queen were beheaded themselves.",
          "This is a large, historic monument/fountain near Place des Quinconces and within minutes of the Tram/Public Transport Office where you can purchase Tram/Bus passes. We got the 7 day unlimited pass for about 13 euro each. If you use it 2-3 times/day it is well worth it.",
          "Well worth looking at if you're in bordeaux as it is really big and intricate on the bottom part where the fountains are.",
          "This is situated in a lovely setting around a green area. A lovely place to sit and enjoy the views and to eat your lunch.",
          "This fountain is very grandiose and well worth seeing. Unfortunately there is no plaque telling you it's history so look it up before you go.",
          "This is an awesome fountain, look closely at the detail. We loved it here, spent a half hour and were amazed, just real nice.",
          "A dramatic fountain that sits at the top of a large avenue representing part of the city's history and heritage. Well worth viewing during a city break.",
          "We had noticed this whilst catching the tram at the Quinconces stop and I had to investigate further. The fountains were beautiful and it was an ideal place to stop and reflect quietly for a few minutes. The display given by the fountains was most therapeutic.",
          "Beautiful artwork, although some might find it a bit over the top. Great fountains as well and interesting because it memorarizes the role of the Girondins during the French revolution",
          "A real magnet on a sunny day and quite rightly so, it is stylish, beautiful and there is so much energy in it with the horses \"leaping out\". One of impressive monuments of Bordeaux.",
          "This fountain is absolutely remarkable. The horses are enormous ... you can't really tell in this photo .. and the spray from the fountain was appreciated on a hot summer day.",
          "The fountain reminded me of the Palace at Versailles. Important within the context of the French Revolution and the mass execution of the Girondins that began the Reign of Terror. Whether or not you know the history of the Monument, it's a beautiful fountain.",
          "This has got to be one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN IVE EVER CAME ACROSS. I took so many photos here that my boyfriend got angry. :)",
          "Amazing monument with two large water features. If there is a down side, there is lots of litter about and the rest of the square are was taken up with a circus, detracting from the view. Worth a visit.",
          "Amazing fountains in bronze, superb detail, luckily not removed by Germans in WW2 to be made into armaments!",
          "Imposing monument to this SW political group and their fall in the Terror. Water from nostrils, breaking chains, oversized features, All visually superb. Even Thomas Paine would have appreciated this monument, and Charlotte Corday would have been impressed",
          "The Quinconces area is being landscaped currently so the monument is surrounded by activity. Liberty breaking her chains stands proudly, overlooking the dusty esplanade and is rightly appreciated by tourists and locals alike.",
          "A wonderful work in pleasant setting spoilt somewhat by the paving work going on which when complete will be worth the current disruption. The monument itself is unaffected. See if you can spot boy on mobile phone!!!",
          "Love it. Dramatic and big and stunning. Walk all the way around it and enjoy it from every angle it's just wonderful",
          "Wonderful statues. Lots of water and in all very beautiful, great for photographers too! Situated within easy reach of a good cafe and public spaces, easy to reach by tram too.",
          "We found our way here on a beautiful, wall-to-wall blue sky day when rainbows were to be found among the statues. Hard to believe we spent the best part of an hour viewing this absolutely wonderful monument.",
          "Great target for a photographer on a sunny day. Sculptures are full of little details made with utmost precision. The fountain makes it even more special.",
          "I think you all will enjoy this monument !! Check it out from every angle. Hopefully the water will be running when you are there.",
          "Beautiful monument that can be seen from most of downtown Bordeaux and a great fountain. The details of the fountain are amazing. Won't take long to visit, but should be on your list.",
          "Lovely place to sit on a hot day as the wind blows water spray to cool you down. Carvings are lovely. Funny to see water coming out of the horses nostrils!!",
          "Lovely to see this fountain . Fabulous history and glad its restored . Interesting details in the water sculpture . Sad to see a few empty drink cans and bottles around it thou that is a problem in most major cities.",
          "Beautiful piece of architecture, design and art...worth a visit, even in the rain! The park and walk behind the monument is beautiful as well.",
          "While we were walking in Bordeaux and discovering that beautiful city we saw this amazing fountain. It is really worth visiting and making a few photos there :-)",
          "Great to walk around the fountain and look at the multiple metal sculptures all around the huge column. Even more interesting to read that all the statuses were removed in the war to melt down for the war effort. these didn't get to the smelter and were all found intact in Anger",
          "You must see this beautiful monument. More importantly you must have the monument explained in detail, i.e....the horses feet, some are dragon feet, some are mermaid feet. There are 3 men at the base that are symbolic to truth.",
          "Really nice fountain. Gorgeous, particularly in the right light (e.g when the sun's going down). Managed to get a couple of good photos.",
          "The central column of this monument, with it's elegant, winged occupant, is visible from all over this end of Bordeaux. But the real treat, for me, came upon closer inspection. At the base of the column, there is a massive, elaborate and heroic landscape of statuary - horses,",
          "Be sure to see this amazing monument in Bordeaux, a short walk down from the Place de la Bourse. It is a wonderful sight to see.",
          "i was amazed to see such a beautiful fountain. like wow, this was one of the best if not the best fountains i have seen in the world. this fountain is with the moment so looks very beautiful. it is worth seeing because it has some history attached. i was fine with english but",
          "One of the best set of fountains I have seen. Although not enormous they are set at the foot of a soaring column in front of an open expanse, an impressive location. The detail is impressive, water spouting from the horses nostrils, the sculptured human forms in metal. So nearly",
          "I love this monument but would have wanted more information about it. There were signs in French and in English, which are very good. But I am so curious of every statue in this monument and wished I could read about it right there. Anyway, it is time for me to google and find",
          "Worth seeing it as part of walking tour or bus tour because there is a lot of history and symbols you'll miss, otherwise. The Germans planned to melt the statues down in their armaments factory, but the Resistance saved them. Take the time to walk around and look closely at",
          "Have a close look at this fountain. The horses are fantastical and the detail amazing. During the war it was going to be melted down for armaments but the Resistance saved it thank heaven",
          "Quite a grand edifice interersting sculpture .. over the top .. something to see on youray some place else..",
          "This landmark of the city of Bordeaux is a must see - with water coming out of the horses nostrils and the statue of liberty standing atop the 43 metre high column",
          "Can recommend a visit whilst enjoying Bordeaux. The fountains are very pretty and an excellent place for a photo-opportunity.",
          "Magnificent monument well worth taking the time to visit. It is situated in a vast square which in itself is worth a visit",
          "Worth going to see, A very big square past the water fountain where events are put on or shows. The fountain depicts various statues and meanings of life.",
          "We really loved this park which was behind our hotel. There was lots of antique stalls to visit as well as a number of food outlets servicing meats and cheese. We enjoyed lunch and breakfast here during our stay. We loved the fountains with the horses around the monuments. Worth",
          "We wandered through Bordeaux, and found this beautiful fountain. A welcome surprise around every corner in this beautiful busy city.",
          "Lovely monument in a quiet part of town, just unassuming in its grandeur - we loved it, and would recommend any visitor to Bordeaux to make sure that you don't miss it.",
          "This monument is beautiful but even better it puts you at the start of the most epic wine tour you will ever take. As an added bonus it's right near a flea market that will introduce you to art and furniture extraordinaire. I would highly recommend leaving the monument and going",
          "Wow. This could be easily overlooked but it is well worth seeking out. It looks better in real life tgan it does in any photo! 1759",
          "A marvelous example of a water feature combined with sculpture. I can be walked around and you can visit the nearby flea markets. TIP-Be careful buying food from some of the vendors here.",
          "Really beautiful monument, near and antiques market. Cool location and its not too far from the Jardin Public. definitely recommend going to see it.",
          "Marvelous statues adjacent to the square Quinconces. Excellent venue for strolling around and enjoying the light.",
          "The Office de Tourisme is situated on the corner of the Esplanade de Quinconces; the tourist buses leave from here and it is a departure point for Trams A & B. The Brocante de Printemps was excellent, the trees provided welcome shade.",
          "Loved seeing it and if you walk around the city you really can not miss it . A must see in my opinion.",
          "I was blown away at the detail of this fountain - every scene and statue has intricate details that you won't find as standard. The park area this fountain and monument is located in happens to be pretty, quiet and a lovely peaceful experience. The fountain pieces are",
          "A great monument but disappointed as this time no water in the fountain.There was strange huts in the avenue up to it so didn't look so grand.",
          "I am sure this looks quite spectacular when it has water in it but we were so disappointed that it was empty when we visited. So much detail in all the sculptures hope to see it another time fully functioning.",
          "It isnt worth to spend more than 1 min in that place. It is just a monument with no others interests around it.",
          "This fountain was very cool. It was nice to know a bit of history about it from the bus tour that we went on. The statues are elaborate, each one different, but can't help and think how good it could have been if there was actually water in it....",
          "This is fantastic - very magical and imposing, the statue can be seen from many different areas and it beautiful. It wasn't switched on when we visited at beginning of April, but it was still brilliant to see.",
          "Worth the time to go see it. the details are amazing and it is truly awe inspiring. Visit at different times of the day too to have various sun exposures and picture oppurtunities.",
          "The monument can be seen from a distance, and is a good landmark to find your way around the city, especially on arrival. Great photo opportunity from a distance and close up. It was a shame that when we visited they hadn't yet started the water so the fountain wasn't working",
          "Lovely monument with beautiful bonze figures at base. Unfortunately water was not on and was obscured by large fair.",
          "The monument is very striking and the recent history (last 70 years) is quite remarkable. The statue was overwhelmed by the tacky fun fair around it on the esplanade.",
          "A huge, monumental fountain dedicated to the political 'martyrs' of the French revolution. It's located in a pleasant square near the river. The fountain was turned off while we were there, but that allowed us to examine in great detail the elaborate and emotional design of the",
          "We had seen the top of the column of this monument from various locations around the city, including from our hotel room. Up close and personal it really is a giant column surrounded by statues of humans and horses and a fountain. Unfortunately when we visited all the fountains",
          "This Monument aux Girondins is one of the must see attractions in Bordeaux city center. There is a lot to see and do nearby, excellent shopping, places to eat or have a drink, hang out and people watch. Although I was visiting in the winter and the water was turned off the",
          "When I visited on the morning I thought that they would turn on on the afternoon so I went back in order to take some potos. It was a pity not to see it with water as it was very beautiful",
          "Must say I liked most of the monuments in France and this one was no exception - as an added bonus there a lot that are quite close together so easy to see quite a few in a day.",
          "Located on place des Quinquonces a big spacious square, it is a mix of column, sculptures and fountain.",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in Bordeaux and more specifically at Quinconces. This monument and fountain is really excellent.",
          "The monument is very large as it is surrounded by water and large representations in human forms. The fountains make it a cool area to be around on a hot day but it is also very interesting to consider what representations have been included in this massive monument which is in",
          "We had seen this outstanding piece of sculpture (it seems somewhat mean to call it a mere \"fountain\") from a distance, but were delighted to see it at close range, which it more than deserves. One needs to take the time to look at the monument from each side, as the sculptures",
          "When I visited, the monument is lost in a carnival type of fair. There are all kinds of games, ferris wheels, bump cars around. I was not able to appreciate the monument.",
          "An interesting and attractive park to visit. We visited during the Euros this year. The park had been dedicated to a \u201cFan Zone\u201d. Spoilt the ambience somewhat - but extremely interesting experience. Worth a visit if visiting Bordeaux.",
          "Definitely you will see it at the center of the city. Don't be lazy and go closer, only if you go close you can feel the beauty of this monument. It is spectacular.",
          "This monument is one of the must see in Bordeaux as the water mirror. Fortunately, all those monuments are close to each other so it is extremely easy to see all of them in two hours. This fountain is at best when water is pouring out the horses mouths. So too bad if you visit",
          "Get up-close, and experience. Seeing from a bus or a distance just doesn't cut it. Wow, huge moving and spectacular",
          "It is best to view this with a guide book or a guide as each side and each figure tells a historic fact or legand",
          "This a very nice monument with a great history behind it. There is a tourist info close to it where you can get a guided tours",
          "There are many historic sights around the city but this one touches many aspects of French history from Roman times through the Revolution. A must see when in Bordeaux.",
          "Very impressiong monument. The statues are beautiful. Too bad the fountains were not working when I visited. It's located in the city centre. A must see in Bordeaux.",
          "The fountain is a monument to French 19th century sculpture. It was removed during the war and later reinstated. Fantastic if you like ornate fountains.",
          "Beautiful fountain in a great location and with beautiful water effect making it a great spot for picture taking and enjoying the views",
          "It was a quick site but the detail of the horses claws and the water spraying and the large figure were very dramatic. It makes you stop and stare.",
          "Monumental fountain on the Place des Quincones. The large figures were in storage for many years and now spew dramatically. The Girondins were involved in the French Revolution.",
          "Well worth a stroll to look at the statuary round the fountains and the monument itself. Suspect that it might get a bit busy at weekends and in high season.",
          "This is really a beautiful monument, in the middle of a park and close to a fair which seems to be there all year round. It looks like it was recently restored.",
          "This place has an interesting history but it can be enjoyed without knowing all of that. The Germans made many changes during the occupation but most has been restored. This is a good place to switch train lines.",
          "Walks with guides go by this fountain and explain how the Nazi's cut the fountain apart and shipped it to Germany to be melted down to provide ammunition. Fortunately the person in charge in Germany recognized this was a work of art and buried it. Later the parts were found",
          "I love visiting fountains in cities and I was very impressed by the Monument aux Girondins. The horses were majestic as water sprouted out from them and their historic formations represented the age of the city of Bordeaux.",
          "This fountain has an interesting history. The setting is lovely but the fountain itself is very ugly!",
          "The Monument aux Girondins is well worth seeing and is quite spectacular. It has a very interesting history. Shame about the fun fair being so close.",
          "This is one of the few places we stopped by to visit, besides the vineyards. It is definitely a must see!! Probably one of the most amazing and beautiful statues that I have ever seen. Love the horses with the weird dragon feet. Simply amazing!",
          "Oh this is a must see, it is so very beautiful with the water spraying all over and when the sun is out it causes rainbows. The sculptures themselves have a truly fascinating history having been stolen, found and re placed where they belong. It's a great meeting place or",
          "The monument is very impressive, especially when you understand the symbolism of every statue. The piece of history represented by the monument is a crucial chapter in the French Revolution.",
          "The most amazing large statue I have seen in a long time, well worth a visit, and spend some time just looking and walking round it. Loved it.",
          "I don't know the story of the people commemorated, but it must be good, it's a fine monument. The fountain works well. Worth a 5 minute visit. Convenient for the bus station.",
          "Spectacular to see. The story of how the French resistance hid the statues during the war and how they were not repositioned until 1982 is fantastic. The monument is huge.",
          "if you're looking for a peaceful walk downtown & around on a warm summer evening, I would highly recommend this place. Additional tip: Looks awesome when it turns dark & lights turn ON.",
          "A very impressive monument near the heart of Bordeaux. There are a few information boards around the outside (on the ground) that give a brief explanation of the monument and the meaning behind it. Highly recommend a visit and one of our favourite parts of the city!",
          "This monument is very impressive, it contains a very detailed fountain full of a sculpted scene. It is also beautiful at night when lit up and is very calming and relaxing to hang out on he stairs of the monument and just enjoy the moment.",
          "This monument is as spectacular as it is fantastical. Situated in a vast parade-ground like Place des Quinconces, it is well worth the visit because it gives you the flavour of how lavish the Bordelaise are and this unrestrained monument to fallen heroes is loudly and proudly",
          "It is just next to the tram and bus station so we went there during day and night. It was pleasant to see the statues in fountain. During hot days it's really refreshing and at night it looks magnificent! If you want to take a break from hectic day, this is the place to be.",
          "A very pretty fountain - on a hot day if you stand close enough you can be cooled down by the mist it gives off. Pay close attention to the detail of the fountain - lovely.",
          "I stumbled upon this fountain while searching for the shopping district, and what a find it was. The statues in the fountain seemed to be a homage to women as nearly every figure is female. I don't speak French so am still unsure what the fountain was for or about but n",
          "Well worth a look when you visit this beautiful city. The 2 chariots with sea horses, one to the republic and one to Concordia are stunning.",
          "This fountain is in a lovely park in the city. It reminds me very much of Trevi Fountain in Rome. Definitely worth visiting for a photo op.",
          "You can spend hours just viewing the detail n the fountain. Spectacular by day and by night. A must if visiting Bordeaux",
          "This is an amazing place and a must see in Bordeaux - it locates in the biggest square in Bordeaux or in the whole France!",
          "Always have to go back to see it - just spectacular and you need to look at it from every side because it has so many different sculptures",
          "The Girondins Monument is located near to the Esplanade de Quinconces. It is a very grand monument, with fountains of bronze statues, as well as a magnificent central column, a top of which is a statue representing the spirit of Liberty. A must see for Bordeaux.",
          "Absolutely amazing fountain at night! While it is pretty during the day, at night it comes alive! The lighted fountain is beautiful when photographed as well.",
          "This is a fabulous fountain in memory of the Girondins.The statues of the sea horses are breath taking. One side of the fountain is about conflict, the other, my favourite is about peace. This is a freat place to visit during the day, and it looks fabulous lit up at night.",
          "It's only when you get up close you realise how magnificent this monument really is. Do visit if you get the chance.",
          "This is a complex monument recognizing the sacrifice of the Girondins during the Reign of Terror, but without a detailed explanation or guide, most of the meaning of the monument would be overlooked. This is a complex monument and if you enjoy architecture and history, I",
          "We walked home via this magnificent sculpture and the local dance group were having a tango 'dance off'; it was fabulous to watch and has made us thinking of taking up dancing, i am so glad that we happened to walk past at that time. The fountains are great .",
          "This is a really impressive monument and fountain, definitely worth seeing. I loved the detail in the monument.",
          "A beautiful fountain and remarkably clean for being so public. Not full of coins and rubbish, It was impressive.Id say it was worth a visit for sure. Just a walk past will do, it's reasonably central.",
          "While in Bordeaux, I was able to see all the city in 2 days of walking, tram riding and enjoy the caf\u00e9 culture. Monuments are not to be missed.",
          "...and it is by a big tram terminal/stop, which is right by the Tourist Office, which I take you might need to find at some point.",
          "This is a fascinating structure and fountain which will be much more appreciated if you have an understanding of why and how it was built (and rebuilt) and what each figure represents. Our wonderful tour guide, Hela, from Bordeaux Walking Tours spent over 15 minutes on the",
          "Powerful monument in the centre of Bordeaux. Full of character; worth spending some time there. It has quite an interesting history which is told in French and English on plaques nearby on the ground.",
          "A must see when in Bordeaux. Having such a beautifully created fountain in any city is a bonus but set in Beatiful Bordeax they take on a life of their own. This monument certainly deserves a visit. Just watching the intricate patterns the water provides against the man made",
          "It's a big fountain with lots of different figures. The meaning is not clear. I wouldn't visit it again, but maybe it means something to the locals.",
          "The non-ferrous monements was dismantled during the second world war and fortunately returned to the right place again. They are carved beautifully and every detail is a stunning experience. Fountain makes the sculptures more alive, specially \"Farewell Peace\", \"Harmony\" &",
          "The detail and intricacies of this fountain were similar to what I have seen in Italy. My young children were mesmerized by the fountain and we were able to get some great pictures. We went when it was raining a bit so it wasn't very busy.",
          "Nice photo spot located in the heart of Bordeaux. These horses were originally supposed to be smelted down because of their non ferrous metal construction in 1942 - but were found hidden a couple years later and reconstructed. Restored in 1982, this is a BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN -",
          "A wonderful collection of sea creatures and horses. The spray coming through the horses' nostrils was wonderful and something I'd never seen before. Awesome.",
          "Monument aux Girondist is well known historic spot in Bordeaux. Perfect place to take a picture from Bordeaux.",
          "This is a really lovely monument, built in the early 20th century. It's dedicated to the girondins, a group of politicians who supported the French Revolution, but were later executed under the orders of one of its leaders, Robespierre, when they opposed some of its extreme",
          "We love water fountains. There's something very soothing and calming about them. Our favourite is still the Trevi Fountain in Rome, but the one is a close second. The detailing on the horse-like sea creatures are incredible. The water jets coming out of the nostrils of the sea",
          "We were in Bordeaux for the finals of the Euro 16 football and the area was turned into a Fan zone. The fountain was dry due to the fans but perhaps also due to the dry waether. This fountain is almost identical to the one in Lyon. That one was for Aquitaine as well but they",
          "This is so beautiful and so interesting. As you walk around it, it just get's weirder and stranger, but in a very good way!",
          "Really nice fontaine. Details of the statues are great carved. Connection of the horse and dragons impressed me the most. Unfortunately wasn't any water flowing in that time when I visited",
          "Not everyone is a football fan and the fan zone was placed right by it. Can only assume that the fountain was emptied because of fans doing certain types of behaviours. Would have equalled sights of Rome.",
          "This rivals the fountains of Rome and Florence for size and detail. the waterworks are great, the park around it is huge. There is a train service and bus service here and you can walk down to the river through the park after. I found a lot of photogenic views of this",
          "On the day we visited the monument they were setting up for an event in the city. It was a pity as the fencing blocked off sections of the fountain area. But this really is an eye catching series of statues and the fountain is quite imposing. Near the city centre and worth a",
          "Just over the road from the Tourist Office,this area was well worth a visit. The fountains were glorious and the statues were marvellous. The football fanzone was in the process of being built at the time but this did not detract from the experience.",
          "big surprise for me, because I did not know that Bordeaux was english for such a long time. A fantastic spring with a big cultural impact.",
          "Stumbled on this beautiful fountain by accident! How can that be? It is lovely, and worthy of a look, with rearing horses spewing water. The story behind it is interesting, too.",
          "This amazing fountain can be found just behind were the 'fan zone' is located. Must see - notice the webbed feet of the horse.",
          "From the end off the Rue St. Catherine, a little bit further up, you can see the monument itself. It is a very impressive fountain, and it is a nice touch that the explanation of what it depicts is set on a plaque on the ground. I imagine that on a busy day it is lovely to just",
          "Liberty is depicted on top of an elegant pillar and on either side below are magnificent prancing horses bathed by fountains. This is an important historical monument with the beauty which is in stark contrast to the horrors of the Reign of Terror which it memorialises.",
          "Such energy, power + movement in a statue! The horses seem so alive, you would not be surprised if they were to come to life and leap towards you! During our stay of several days, I kept going back to enjoy this fountain!",
          "The fountain is very nice and has interesting detail as you walk around. Nice place to sit a relax on a nice day.",
          "Not much to say, you need to appeciate it in the sunshine! If the place is empty, view from the river.",
          "This monument is one of the most impressive we have seen on our 12 day tour of France. It is impressive from all 4 sides. The fountains are spectacular and create a fairy tale like effect. We also returned at night to take some pictures when the monument was lit and were able",
          "Another must see in Bordeaux of course. With a good guide, you will get a proper history of it all. As well as an explanation of all the different statues. Take a good walk around to photograph from every angle.",
          "Beautiful imposing fountain that is a short walk from the city center and near the water front. This fountain reminded us a little of the Trevi fountain in Rome only in metal. Definitely worth the visit. When we were there was an antique market nearby, plus food stalls and a",

          "I recommend checking it out! It was at the end of Europe's largest piazza, which seemed to be an antique market.",
          "Walked through the enormous bric a brac market on Sunday and the fountain at the end gave a splendid vista. Good to sit next to and contemplate.",
          "Even though the water had not yet been put in the fountain seeing this incredible monumental fountain was a treat. I got to see it with special lighting for the City Marathon in April.",
          "This monument has a great deal of history and meaning. Take the walking tour of Bordeaux that starts each morning at the tourism office at 10:00 for a wonderful description of the figures and history of this monument.",
          "In a city with wonderful sculpture this is a delightfully mad and oddly impressive monument to the city. Rollicking with sea horses, gossiping maidens and a wrestling match it brims with warmth, energy and love of life. Don't miss it.",
          "Loved Bordeaux, and loved this fountain (which is easy to find, and nice and central). Madly crammed with wonderful figurines - worth a look.",

          "Loved by the Bordeaux people, this sculpture comes with fascinating history of how it was saved from the Nazi invasion. The Esplanade des Quinconces was featuring a large carnival while we were here that was bustling day and night. This fountain is a showpiece and a good marker",
          "I'm a big fan of fountains, and this was a particularly good one. It's huge, and fairly unique. Note the horses that turn into sea creatures.",
          "The fountain looks as if it's impressive, but it was in scaffolding and the water was gone. Unfortunately we couldn't find any information on why the girondins were significant. It's at a nice square where we had a nice walk though.",
          "The Monument erected high up and can be seen from a distance. However, one must get there, walk or taken the tramway to admire the sculptures at the base fountains, on either sides. The sculptures layouts on either sides are similar; but with difference themes. Unfortunely,",

          "While most come to admire the different figures of fountains that do make it very interesting, I found it recreational. The energy the statues exude is a reflection on the creativity of the people who conceived and executed the park that attracts so many people.",

          "This is a large water feature worthy of a look. I always love fountains with horses so this is no exception. We visited this monument on a hot day. It's always refreshing to wander around these at this time. It's near t river so take this in as you do a river walk.",

          "The photos of the Monument aux Girondins that I had seen did not begin to capture the power of this monument. The one I attached is similarly limited. It is huge; the statuary is oversized and quite fantastical, including giant aquatic horses. It is set in a large mostly park",
          "The first time we saw this huge monument all the fountains were working but not on this visit to Bordeaux it was dry and not as spectacular. The monument is located at the end of Place des Quinconces, a short walk from the quai. The monument was built at the end of the 19th",

          "I stayed in Bordeaux for 4 months and have to say this this was my favourite spot in the city. It is so beautifully French, you can go and relax by there in the summer with a book and a coffee and it even manages to maintain its peaceful charm in winter. A surprisingly quiet",
          "as much for its history as in itself (to continue from my title). It is not easy to be missed, as it consists of a very high obelisk topped by a golden sculpture. I first spotted it from the Grand Theatre, and was more or less pulled towards it, though I did not at first",

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\nTour Pey-Berland (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux. It was built in the early 6th century on the site of a palaeochristian necropolis. It has an 11th-century portico, while the apse and transept are from the following century.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

They were both evicted in order to renovate the monument. There is a...more Suggested Duration:1-2 hours Address:\nPlace du Palais, 33000, Bordeaux FranceMap ",
          "Everywhere we walked in the city was eye candy. We came to Porte Cailhau, or door of the palace. It was considered the door of the city. The original one was built in the 14th century and this one was completed in the 15th. It is quite a sight! We walked around to the other",
          "We come upon this by chance as we are walking along the Garonne River . Built in 1495 to keep the invaders out. It is 35 Meters high with a castle like appearance. It was once the main entrance gate to Bordeaux.",
          "So much awesomeness it unbelievable. Seeing these arches in Bordeaux in person after waiting 9 months I'm completely awe struck. Worth all the headaches to get here. I love all the detail. Having the Pont de Pierre across the street is just a bonus. I'm truly loving all the",
          "During our visit to Bordeaux, we were walking through the old town and by the banks of the Garonne river and the Porte Caihau was present from both sides. It's a magic monument to admire at equally during the day and at night.",
          "Again we visited on a free entry day. Saw all three levels and displays in each room on the way up.Better spiral staircase.and a good view of the river. The area behind is the Place de Palais.",
          "Located overlooking the Ponte De Pierre bridge, the Porte Cailhau stands, as it did historically, at the very edge of Bordeaux city centre. Originally the gate for the city walls, this rather striking, almost fairytale castle looking tower has been rather nicely integrated",
          "Lovely Gateway Tower in the heart of the City near to the River. If your very mobile take a trip up the winding staircase 4 floors to the top for the lovely views over the River. There are little exhibitions on each floor so ensure you get the translation card when paying your 5",
          "An armored gate not to keep invaders out, but to keep citizens from leaving France and goin to England.",
          "Just across the road from the River and behind several side streets with cafes and restaurants. Three floors with information of its purpose and views across the river. 5 Euros entry or free with City Pass.",
          "This is a beautiful gateway - with strange sides that look as though they have been just hacked away from the city wall. The towers are beautiful - like a chataeu - maybe Disney copied them for his iconic symbol? Nice little square overlookng gate with good places to eat..",
          "This medieval gate, located close to the Garonne river was the gateway to the city. It is a fascinating sight and beautifully lit at night. There are usually concerts here in the evening and the music can be very loud. We didn\u2019t go up The tower but read that the stairs up are",
          "You can still see where the ancient town wall was attached to the tower and gate guarding the entrance to the city from invaders arriving by sea along the river. Climbing up a narrow spiral staircase and paying the entrance fee you can visit the top of the building for better",
          "Once occupied by King Richard the Lionheart, the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen consort of France and England and one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She married King Louis VII of France, son of her guardian,",
          "It is a an absolutely lovely gate, both from outside and inside. If you use Bordeaux pass, you have entrance for free, otherwise you need to pay 5 euros. The exhibitions inside are small, but present a history of the gate and the whole city. Both members of staff were friendly",
          "I have taken day photos but the night photos are the ones to treasure. On the city side of the Porte is a cafe where you can sip your drinks and admire he Porte",
          "This gate is something to behold. The center tower has a twist in it that provides a photographers delight in me. I looked at this for a while as it was so fascinating to me. Don't look at it though and continue to walk since there are small steps in the area.",
          "Great picture opportunity to take another icon of the city which shoild not be missed ,you can enter if you wish.",
          "Beware! There's no warning outside that you have to pay as there is a set of steps leadingup from the pavement beneath and a sign saying 'ouvert'. I'd thought it was just a tower with a view, but in fact it's a museum - actually quite a good museum about the gatehouse's history",
          "A fascinating look back in history, with exhibits on all floors. Stairs steep and narrow. Interesting view from the top.",
          "Just in front of the river Gironde stands this main Gate to the city centre, a beautiful remnant from times long past! From a nearby terrace, drinking a good espresso, we enjoyed the view to this gate.",
          "The main gate of the former walls is impressive to see, and it makes you think how the walls were in centuries ago.",
          "It\u2019s one of those city features where you are impressed the first time you see it, yes go see it. But the shopping street before and after, detract from the historical impact.",
          "This is a very impressive structure. We did not go inside but it appears you can also do that. Make sure you also visit the other remaining Porte's especially the Grosse Clock.",
          "Bordeaux is a wonderful place to explore on foot. there's much to see just looking at architecture, gates, buildings, green spaces. the atmosphere is very french and worth a long walk.",
          "But do not bother to get in it. We went up. The staircase was very narrow. When we arrived at the till, there was a group of 10 people which were given a tour. It was so crowded because of the group that we decided to turn back and take pictures from the outside only",
          "This well preserved medieval city gate is certainly an attractive structure, especially at night time when it\u2019s beautifully lit. There are many restaurants and bars in the vicinity.",
          "I imagine the stories these old gates could tell and I appreciate their tenacity to still remain standing after so vey many centuries. This lovely was built in 1494 and costs $5 Euros to tour. There is an audio visual presentation and some displays of tools and building",
          "Stunning architecture! For sure, one of the most beautiful buildings in the very center of Bordeaux. An ocasion to take good pics.",
          "Ehhhh.... Not much you can do but take a picture of this beautiful Disney-like structure. Stare at it! It is a medieval gate/port. Pretty when lit up at night. There is an itsy-bitsy museum on top which is not worth the 5 euros they charge. There isn't much historical",
          "The interior of this tower is now a museum. On one floor there is a film about the 100 years war. The staff very kindly set it so that it was in English. Very well done and held our attention. I now understand more about a period of our history that I previously knew little",
          "Port Cailhau has great historical artifacts and is definitely worth the \u20ac3.50 (for student) or \u20ac5.00 entry fee! There are videos that explain the artifacts and a great view at the top looking over the river!",
          "Following on from my last review we'll with a visit. The area inside from the gate has bar restaurants catering for the tourists. Avoid eating but coffee OK.",
          "Porte Cailhau is another city gate from medieval times set across the Garonne river. It's a gateway to tiny Old town narrow streets and fairy tale looking both day and night.",
          "This was a medieval gate that is located across from the waterfront and enters into the old town area. Stunning at night when bathed in light, it is more interesting during the day when you can study it. The front and the back are very different. Pay the 5\u20ac to climb to the",
          "by day & night. Worth a diversion to walk past/under. We were lucky enough to see it on a quiet Friday and then with 1000s flooding through to watch the Bastille celebration fireworks.",
          "Porte Cailhau is located on Place du Palais by the waterfront. This medieval stone gate has its historical value as it controlled the entry of people to town and prevented intruders from all time. Currently if you want to climb up the top of this city gate, you need to pay a",
          "One of the mediaeval city gates. Well preserved/restored and open to visit. Interesting stuff about stone masons and good views from the top.",
          "Beautiful architecture and history with nice explanations in English. Worth a detour on a sunny day. Check out the bronze model of the city about 75 ft away.",
          "Pretty old and also well managed historical structure in the middle of the city. Even if you aren't history enthusiast it's worth of visit",
          "Dating from the late 1400\u2019s this 100 foot city gate is open to the public, for a nominal fee. We visited during the evening and it was closed to visitors. Well lit at night making for an impressive photo opportunity.",
          "They meant business when they built up this gate. Looks really impressive. It is historical gate built in the XV century. Since 1883, the gate has been included in the register of historical monuments of France. Porte Cailhau stands on the Palace Square (la place du Palais) on",
          "one of Bordeaux's impressive city gates, looking like a castle, controlling the access from the riverside and protecting the city from intruders - once upon a time. today tourists flock through and around.",
          "This structure is still standing after all these years. Good views to be had from the river. There is a \u20ac5 entry fee to climb to the top for views across the river and beyond.",
          "A part of Bordeaux you must visit. Just meander round taking in all the surroundings then stop for a coffee or glass of wine.",
          "Such a unique, interesting, and beautiful sight to see. Adds to the character of the city and photographs well, even in the dark and at night. A staple of Bordeaux. I would suggest seeing it at night as well as the day.",
          "You can feel the atmosphere of the city from the Porte Cailhau and you can imagine the great feeling you can have when you will stay and drink a glass of wine to a table from the nearest restaurants",
          "This place is burned into my dreams, it is so beautiful. Great wine shop, Cave Art & Vin right there too.",
          "Historical landmark worth a look if you're in the area. Close to the hustle and bussle of the city while there.",
          "It was so much fun to walk through this building. Almost could imagine being a fairy tale Princess..",
          "Like many ancient sights in Europe, the name is a bit of a mystery -- whether it is derived from an ancient noble family of Bordeaux or from pebbles that washed ashore from the Garonne River. This arch is built on the site of an ancient city gate in the 15th Century.",
          "Very impressive structure but hard to get a picture the day we were there without someone begging in the shot. Spoilt it a bit for me. Worth seeing by night as it is lit up well.",
          "This is a beautiful old gate to the city with tall spires that give the appearance of an old chateau or magical castle. Interestingly, each side of the gate look rather different. The front (river) side has two spires plus the central tower whereas the opposite side has three",
          "When you look at this structure you just have to stand back and look at awe as it is so detailed and feels magnificent in that it towers above everything else that is modern This just has a good feel to it that it seems to be a lot older than it really is Recommended to go",
          "Built from 1493 - 1496 this monumental gate is across the river from the Palais De l' Ombriere dedicated to Charles VIII in 1495 for his victory at the Battle of Fournoue. It's a very interesting gate close to the road along the waterfront and well worth a visit while walking",
          "A historic and enchanting old building forming a portal into the old town. There is a pretty square behind it lined with cafes and restaurants so it is a good place to take a break from your sightseeing. There is a viewing deck at the top of the tower although we did not climb",
          "Not only is this better than any Disney Land castle, it is the entry way into a pretty little square, the hub of the hood. A few cafes and eateries offer breakfadt, lunch or dinner or a spot to relax with coffee or a glass of wine and marvel in the magnifence of it all! A must",
          "This square facing the Porte Caillou, built over 500 years ago, in 1496 is a wonderful place to sit a have a drink, a meal, or just a coffee. in one of several restaurants.",
          "Very well preserved entrance to the old city. It reminds me of the chateau de chambord at Loire valley.",
          "When walking around Bordeaux this gate gives you a great feeling for the ancient heart of the city. Its located beside beautiful place with many cafes.",
          "This used to be the entrance to the village, as I understand, which puts things in a very different perspective. I did not tour the inside, but just the view of it is lovely and the square where it exists is very lively with a great atmosphere.",
          "Something magical about the Porte at night - faces the river and with the water mirror nearby. Great seafood restaurant on corner.",
          "Beautifully preserved old gate, with nice steeply sloping slate roofs, reminiscent of a Loire chateaux. It looks as if there were once walls on both sides, but these are long gone, replaced by buildings themselves several hundred years old. The stumps remain on the outer side of",
          "Lovely, fairy-tale like building (out daughters thought it looked like a castle out of a Disney princess story). Sits on a nice, lively square. But that is about it. I guess you can stop by for a photo-op, while exploring the old town from the Place de la Bourse.",
          "We were told after we paid the viewing deck was closed. We were told that we had the option to go back later on our tickets, however this didn't fit into our plans. The building itself is beautiful, but the museum inside needs to be expanded, and is lacking much historical",
          "Like others have mentioned, it's a castle in the middle of the city. Surrounding it are restaurants you can certainly enjoy a meal and do some people watching, which is always a fun and favorite pastime of mine. Unfortunately, that's all you can do. Gaze upon the beauty of the",
          "Lovely sightseen. Used to be one of the doors of the city and today is an outstanding sightseen. Must visit during the day and night. After the visit, enjoy the coffees and bars around it. Lovely!!",
          "this really is a beautiful place to look at the exterieur is fairytale and looks amazing on sunny days and in the rain and at night the floodlighting is perfect - a fairy tale so i went in adn paid the 5 euro entrance and was really disappointed by how little information and",
          "This highly decorated gateway at one edge of the city centre stands out amongst the many other attractive limestone edifices as being particularly striking. In common with the Grosse Cloche (of which it is very reminiscent) it may not absorb much of your time but, as a",
          "Historians disagree as to the provenance of the name, but they are sure that it was built to announce the Victory of Charles VIII in Italy. If you feel like claiming to the top, it will afford you great views of the city. **",
          "When walking around Bordeaux, it's definitely worth taking a look at this ancient gateway to the old part of the city. Opening out into the beautiful Place de Palais line with cafes, it gives you a great feeling for the ancient heart of Bordeaux.",
          "We love this gate for its impressive size and beauty, but the best thing about it is that its the entrance to a very interesting part of Bordeaux - an area populated by young people, lots of fun wine bars and restaurants appealing to all ages, and a great place to rent an",
          "Lots and lots of people in the street for blocks and blocks, so don't go here if you're agoraphobic. But otherwise fantastic sidewalk cafes and shopping.",
          "Another tower to climb - should you desire to do so. Previously a major gate into the city but now just a landmark. Brief bio of gate nearby. 1758.",
          "This is in the centre and looks really amazing at night. It feels like the beginning of a castle but you can just walk right through.",
          "This tower is so beautiful, magical looking and quite an entrance to the historical area. During the day you can imagine princesses being locked away there and knights saving them, fantastic medieval scenes played out because this tower is like a great fairytale. At night",
          "One of the ancient monuments of the city. Definitely a must see! The wall that used to compose the monument no longer exist, but Porte Cailhau itself deserves a beautiful picture!",
          "I'm so lucky that my rented apartment in Bordeaux has a up close and personal view of this magnificent castle like structure that was built in the years 1493 - 1496. This was once the entrance to the walled city of Bordeaux. It's worth seeing Porte Cailhau in both the daylight",
          "This really looks like something out of a fairytale. You can't miss it when you walk along by the river and you will no doubt take many photos of it!",
          "I love this monument, it is in a great location, it is so beautiful and has a wonderful square behind it to sit and have a drink, soak up the atmosphere and people-watch.",
          "We were the only three visitors so had the place to ourselves. Compact gate house over three floors, useful information panels on each level and great views over the river and rooftops around Place de la Bourse. Expect this could get busy at peak times of the season.",
          "This was my favorite gate into Old Bordeaux. The design is rather like a fairy tale, the road goes around on each side, a pedestrian path through the center - that, on the ground, a scallop marks the path of the Camino de Santiago. A pretty plaza awaits on the other side, from",
          "Bordeaux is steeped in maritime history and it's lovely to come across this beautiful piece of architecture in the old part of the city.",
          "This gateway is set back from the road, so you are unable to see it as you walk along Quai Richelieu until you are virtually upon it. It stands impressively at 35 meters tall with multiple conical towers. It was built to celebrate the French victory at the Battle of Fornovo in",

          "Another beautiful and elaborately carved stone gate at the edge of old town Bordeaux, this gate was built in 1495 and marks the entrance along the quays to the St Pierre district. It is wonderful simply to look at and photograph but you can also climb up inside it too for a",
          "Stumbled upon this while exploring the area but didn't find this too impressive, but stumbled on it again at night, and it was a different story. The medieval feel of the monument is at its best at this time, and we were mesmerized by the beauty of the castle front. Once the",
          "Inside of the tourist info point suggested tour. This city is full of historical sites and places and this is one of them",

          "Monumental door to historic city a few meters away from the famous Place de la Bourse. Majestic architecture and details. One of many Bordeaux's charming monuments.",
          "The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. Can you imagine the \"Portal\" to this city? I am sure that nobody wants to miss it, is the main entrance to the historic center.",
          "The old entrence to the city and one of the unavoidable places in the city. If you want to know more about it there are walking tours going from the main squere steps from the teater",

          "Very nice monument to see. Not sure that you can visit the inside. Located in the old city centre you should at least walk by this!",
          "Had a nice meal overlooking this lovely building. Had a really nice meal in the restaurant next to it.",
          "Bordeaux City Pass meant free entry but 3 Euros if not. Small exhibitions on each floor. Overview of history helpful.",
          "The towers of this gate display the massive amounts of stone necessary to support them. You can climb during the day. Otherwise, just enjoy the local ambiance.",
          "We rented an apartment just around the corner so we were able to be delighted several times a day, in all different lights. Truly very special. I couldn't take enough pictures. The locale is pretty neat, too, several cafes so you can sit, sip, relax and enjoy the Disneyesque",
          "Since its set back from the buildings fronting the main drag along the river, this site is easily missed. It's a few blocks south of Place de la Borse and worth strolling down there to have a look.",
          "we walked through here on the way to the cathedral to see the light show, again it was stunning we could not believe how much stunning stuff there was in Bordeaux. well worth a visit",
          "We saw a door open and some steps leading inside, So being nosey, we went inside On the first floor you can pay 3.5 Euros to the top. Its not amazing, But if you like old buildings go for it",
          "Great to finally walk up and visit all the way to the top. Does not take long and so interesting to learn the history. And so silly of us that we had never thought of it until our last trip to Bordeaux. My husband and I have spent so much time enjoying the beautiful view this",
          "Stopping here to view the Porte gives some indication of the history of Bordeaux and the old port. It is a beautiful part of the city",
          "The gate is beautiful and looks fascinating. But visiting is hard. There was a notice implying it was open, but the door was locked. About 20 minutes later we found there was a guide (only guided tours allowed) who had wandered off down the road with two tourists. No notice, no",
          "This old gateway was a most interesting piece of architecture and definitely worth your time for a good look. It's very decorative despite its age. I can imagine that it has taken some pains to keep it looking good.",

          "I think this dates back to the 1400s, and it's one of the more imposing structures in Bordeaux. However, amid everything else, it can sometimes be lost. Just take a walking tour among the streets for several blocks along the waterfront and then move in and wander down the",
          "It's charming and so historic, love it. It's associated with the Camino de Santiago ! Love it ! We took a two hour walking tour with a guide, this was one of the main stopping places on the tour! There is also a plaque in this location which gives you an explanation of the",

          "Another Great Gate. Although this is only a \"gate\", it still is an impressive structure by the river. In fact it is a national French monument. It used to serve as a \"gate\", an entrance to the local palace from the port. It dates to the 15th century.",

          "This gate is architecturally interesting and aesthetically pleasing - makes for nice photos. You can go to the top. We couldn't go because it was closed 12-1pm, and we didn't bother coming back for it.",

          "Romantic and so easy to walk to! This really is just a 'gate', but what a gate it is! I recommend walking to it and on to the water mirror, both a free evening stroll!",
          "Nice little tower with some insight available into the actual building of such a structure. Good exhibits and fact sheet available. Well worth a look if you're in the area as it's only \u20ac3.50 to take yourself round it. Decent views from the highest point.",

          "We thought this gate was one of the most impressive in the city. You can pay 3.50 euros and make your way to the top to see the views of the area. The neighborhood around the gate is walk worthy. Some interesting shops and restaurants.",
          "Situated in the historic old quarter of the city, if you walk the riverfront you are highly likely to stumble onto this gem. It's definitely worth wandering through the narrow medieval streets in the surrounding area.",
          "While adventuring the side streets, take time to pass under and even climb this old gate! Was not to crowded midday at lunch, but would bet it can get busy. Check out all the cool stores and restaurants around the area!",
          "the view is picture perfect. Actually, we are not fully aware that there's this kind of building that looks like a palace along the street. You won't easily notice it and appreciate it because almost all buildings in bordeaux are the same.",
          "What can I say...its the view from our appartment, and the both the monument and the square where its located are beautiful examples of the noble stone and homogeneity of Bordeaux. The towers that crown the tower give it a fairy-tale aura, and the lighting at night is also",

          "This gate is located in the Place du Palais, a nice and not too big square where you can have a petit-dejeuner (breakfast) , lunch and dinner, or a simple drink. This gate was builded later than the La Grosse Cloche, in fact it was biulded at the end of the 1400. Personally , I",
          "We happened to stumble upon this jewel of an attraction while walking into some popular regions of the city and it was a nice piece of architecture. We truly got the feel of Bordeaux and its history just by looking at the Porte Cailhau for a couple of minutes. This attraction",
          "The Porte impressed us from the outside; we managed to take a few good photos of it and enjoyed reading the poetry about Eleanor's marriage which united the English and French thrones, but once we climbed up the stairs, we were slightly underwhelmed. The first level was free,",
          "This is an impressive monument -- both during the day and at night. We created a walking tour of Bordeaux, and this was one of our stops.",
          "As the title says this was an impressive and quite unique sight but it was not quite in the same league as the Grosse Cloche. Walking through the Porte Cailhau takes you into a very nice area in old Bordeaux. My individual reviews have to be seen in the following context. We",
          "Nothing much to get excited about. See the attached photo. That is it. A climb up the narrow stairs got us to the reception. A further climb beyond that requires a fee, but we decided it was not worth it. The guy at the reception was falling asleep due to boredom.",
          "This is an impressive structure by the water near where one boards boats to do the river cruises. Very impressive on the outside, but it doesn't really live up to the promise on the inside. Interesting enough, but it doesn't provide any real view for the '23 metres' viewpoint",
          "Day or night, a lovely site to see on foot or by tour bus. Requiring 100 words on an attraction seems excessive. How much more can you say, even about a medieval portal of entry?",

          "This old gate in the (now vanished) city wall is well worth a visit. It has a small museum on the 1st floor and several rooms above. Perhaps talks too much about stone masons, but still very interesting. Rcommended",
          "Of all the various portes we thought this one was the prettiest. There is a fee to get to the top for the view.",
          "Just like most of Bordeaux refurbished old city , give yourself the necessary time to walk all over the old downtown , visit churches and chapel from St Pierre to StMichel church, a little walk into the middle ages and the 18th century constructions, then a strall on the river",

          "We stopped here as we strolled through the city. Not everything in bloom as it was April but still a lovely place to visit.",

          "Enjoyed lunch in this park on a very lovely day in early November! Flowers still in bloom and wonderful sights to enjoy everywhere we looked. Sad to see that a very old cedar tree had to be cut down due to disease, but happy to see thriving palm trees and bamboo as well.",
          "Jardin Public is a beautiful garden. If you visit Bordeaux in summer time, a rest in Jardin Public is very welcome. You can stay or lay on the lawns and even have a picnic ( but clean everything afterwards). In spring and summer you can admire Beautiful flowers. In fall, the",

          "A public park that we found when doing a walk around the town. The kid's playground is excellent and gives them a lot to do for some considerable time. Also in the park is an enclosed area for dogs which means you are not mixing kids and dogs in the same place. The water and",
          "Bordeaux does not spend enough on this park. Botanic garden very neglected, displaying mostly obtrusive labels with dead plants. The fern bed in my back garden puts theirs to shame. The main park is better, but tired and unimaginative. Museum of natural history closed, liked",

          "Whilst the park area is pleasant enough the botanical section is a disgrace: overgrown with weeds and no flowers for the season. In a wonderful major city like Bordeaux the authorities ought to be able to do much better.",

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:\n\n\n=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===\nSince 1947, there have been 5 mayors of Bordeaux:\n\nRPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to Les Republicains in 2015\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).\nThe University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\n\nThe University Bordeaux 1, (Maths, Physical sciences and Technologies), 10,693 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Segalen (Medicine and Life sciences), 15,038 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 3, Michel de Montaigne (Liberal Arts, Humanities, Languages, History), 14,785 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 4, Montesquieu (Law, Economy and Management), 12,556 students in 2002\nInstitut of Political Sciences of Bordeaux.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "Looked like a bit of the path as it doesn't work in the Winter as they are afraid of someone slipping on the ice! It was 12\u00b0C! They don't publicise that!",
          "Most of the adult people there were sitting next to it, most of the kids around there were running around in it. So pictures of this place look more beautiful and calm than they really are, but it is close to couple of other touristy places that you probably have on your \"To do",
          "We were really looking forward to seeing the miroir d'eau but they don't turn the water on until April! This is understandable but it would be nice for the Government Tourist website to mention this information. It's the lack of that was a bother.",
          "The water mirror lake was empty, so not great! Not sure, but it may be empty during Winter months generally.",
          "It was a cool place , do recommend to at day light so photos to be more clear , also beautiful at night but it can get cold !",
          "The water mirror wasn't working at the time of our visit in January. Presumably for fear of the underground reservoir freezing up and cracking its walls, or the pavement becoming so slippery injuries would result. Perfectly good reasons for closure. However there's no excuse",

          "We went to the presumed mirror three times, but the water was not present that means the mirror did not exist. I don't know if it depended on the season, winter, but I think that it should not occur! Above all for a Unesco monument!",
          "Looks very grey and granite like when you turn up in the winter. It's not actually on all year round.",
          "The water mirror is a beautiful feature of the city. The people watching is worth the stroll to view the mist and take pictures. The City of Bordeaux is more than I expected. This city is giving Paris a run for her money.",

          "According to wikipedia, it\u2019s the largest reflecting pool in the world. Built in 2006 of granite slabs, it is being covered by up to 2cm of water flowing from the underground installation. In the summer a fog is \u201cproduced\u201d every 15 minutes.

          "They built a really nice mirror effect installing mini fountains on a concrete surface. Recommanded to go there at the blue hour.",
          "Ideally situated on the shoreline of The Garonne facing the Place De La Bourse. Part of the building on the Place is being renovated with associated hoarding which takes from the symmetry of any photo. If the weather is calm reflections are good - worth a shot",
          "Great place to people watch and enjoy the water mirror. We went the first day we arrived and were fortunate to have a sunny day.",
          "Lovely reflection in center of Bordeaux. Go to tourist office for walking directions to this interesting site. Unique , along water in historic area.Nightime provides a different perspective. Well worth seeing. Do not miss this experience.",
          "This was the highlight of our day. It was a bit cloudy and walking towards it from the Palace...thought there was no reflection. Standing in front facing the Palace was a Wow. Fabulous artistic display. I took a photo of my husband..flipped it around ..called him upside down",

          "For being mostly just concrete walk way. In my opinion it's genius. We had a great time walking around and taking photos and just chilling out people watching. This was one of my main reasons in Bordeaux for our trip. It definitely doesn't disappoint unless you're a hater. I",
          "An interesting feature. Needs a calm day to see the best reflections - if the air is not still it's not very impressive. A number of cities have similar features but this one reflects some impressive buildings - when the air is calm.",

          "We had a look at the famous water mirror during day time. But there is not much to see besides a plenty of children playing in the water. I gues a vist at night would be much better.",
          "This is essentially a reflecting pond most of the time. It does cycle from dry, misting to full of water. The water and the lighting make for a dramatic effect with the backdrop of the centuries old buildings behind it. You will see a lot of people around and enjoying this",
          "This would have been even more beautiful however the one side was undergoing scaffolding. Still worth visiting to see the mirror effect and architecture.",

          "Well worth the trek around the city to see this. If you time it right you will get some amazing pictures",
          "We were here for a week and saw it in a range of conditions .It really is fabulous. Our only drawback is that there appears to be no notification of what it does , water mist every 23 minutes",
          "Don\u2019t miss this really cool attraction. We were there at sunset and it was sensational. The water drains and just when you are about to give up, the fine mist comes out. It\u2019s an insta worthy shot Check it out",

          "We stayed in downtown Bordeaux and enjoyed walking down to the river and frequently ended up at the Miroir d'Eau. The feaure consists of a water system that sprays water every 15 minutes or so on a large (37,000 square feet) granite slab creating a reflecting pool. Of course it",
          "We caught this in late afternoon (ok) and later, after dark when the lights go on (fantastic). Stunning vista of old Bordeaux. Definitely a must-do for the photo album.",

          "We came upon this spot on a evening stroll to the center Bordeaux. This is an excellent place for taking pictures. If the air is calm and crazy Americans are not walking in the water you\u2019ll be able to get a fantastic mirrored picture of the stately building in the background.",
          "Maybe this shallow pool does its tricks on nicer days than the rainy day we were there, but we saw nothing special. We waited for a while to see if it would \"perform\", but no luck. So, it is a pretty spot, but nothing amazing. I imagine if you are in Bordeaux, it is one of those",
          "The first time we saw this it was breezy which spoilt the effect. The next visit the reflections were good. Kids playing in the water half an inch deep and every 23 minutes there was a mist effect for a few minutes quite eerie.",

          "It\u2019s free and a good way to cool off Nice views into the city Easy walk through mirror water we was a couple it families loved it",
          "Pretty damn cool place to check out in Bordeaux! It was souring heat, the water vape from the floor refreshes your legs! It\u2019s a must see for sure",
          "Go there during the golden hour, has to be at night time because they only open after 9 am. Lots of movement.",
          "Fell upon this attraction by accident as it was on and it is amazing and a real photo stop and a great cooling off it needed. The pictures you can get from it are brilliant.",
          "Definitely a must see in Bordeaux. I\u2019m sure every visitor goes here, easy to find near the river and enjoyable to see.",
          "I haven't seen an exhibit quite like this - and suggest you see it at night and again during the day. The reflections for the watery marble floors are magnificent At certain times a misty spray pops up to give really good photo opportunites. Fun for kids too It wasnt too clear",
          "This is a clever installation that allows you to get perfect reflections of the elegant buildings It is also really popular with children It\u2019s well worth the walk",
          "We came across this by accident when walking back from the old town to our ship. There were dozens and dozens of people in the water which is very shallow and great for kids. Where there was nobody the reflection on the water of the architecture behind was fantastic. A very",
          "viewed this by day then by night and also got to see the mist - definately worth seeing whilst in Bordeaux",
          "The water mirror is worth visiting during the day and especially a night when surrounding buildings are lit up. Take your camera...",
          "Not as spectacular as some of the photos suggest but can see it being fun for the kids, not sure how frequent the sprays are activated , passed by several times and there were always people standing around waiting ! Saving grace is it\u2019s at the heart of the city riverside and",
          "A lovely place to spend an hour or so the water mirror is a must to visit in bordeaux.A great place to stop off for a picnic on a good day.",
          "This is a wonderful place to have some simple old fashioned fun with the kids. The regular misting, emptying and refilling of the pool creates a great atmosphere. Many people sit on the large concrete traffic bollards but they are actually across the cycle lane from the mirror.",
          "At first, when a friend told me about this place, I didnt understand the big fuss. But being there was actually so joyfull, snd the look of it was truely wawwoo. My 2 kids (9,13) liked it a lot.",
          "A must see if visiting the city. Next to the riverbank & reflecting the lovely old buildings of Bordeaux. But make sure you wait to see the water come alive with a mist which gives a great effect to the surroundings.",
          "On a hot day this is a great way to cool down plenty of people there paddling in the water. Some dance groups also entertaining around the edges A must if in Bordeaux",
          "All buildings need upkeep - so scaffolding and barriers not withstanding this is a lovely place in the evening. Lots of local people having impromptu picnics and the vibe was lovely. The mirror effect is something special!",
          "I made very nice pictures on sunset and i discover a beatiful story place. Is really good for pictures!! Is romantic place and on sun set but when is still light all the buildings are .. yes like in a mirror!! What to say?? Is perfect gift for a tourist!! Not far, in the center",
          "In reality this scene DOES NOT look the omnipresent gorgeous picture. There is a giant fountain in front, center to the square enclosed by the 3 buildings, there is the broad walk, then there is the major road, the main thoroughfare where all cars go on, you will then cross the",
          "A water park that changes style every three minutes. From a shallow pool to a higher mist. Great for kids ad photography earl in the day.",
          "Easily one of the best things in Bordeaux. Great for the kids to play in and brilliant for the adults to cool down in. The reflection is also amazing. Absolutely loved The Mirror and would definitely visit it again!!",

          "This is probably my favourite water feature anywhere. We didn\u2019t get to see it as a mirror as it is always full of people, but it didn\u2019t matter as the feel good that you get from being there is amazing. Just kids and adults enjoying the water, as it comes, goes and vapourises!",
          "Could have viewed this place for hours. Sunny day and everything just glistened. If you appreciate architecture as do I, Paris offers you these treasures. Expect crowds and long lines. Very helpful staffers.",
          "The atmosphere is amazing. The reflections superb and it is just a great place to go any evening you are in Bordeaux",
          "Bordeaux is a beautiful city. Big but the centre is walkable if you have the energy to go all day. The water mirror was very busy as it was a hot day but still OK to get an impression.Probably better to go early in the morning or later in the evening when theres less kids about.",
          "A great place to cool down - whatever your age. It can be crowded but does not feel uncomfortable because of the large area it covers.Great to people watch or to join in.",
          "Went on a summer evening in August and it was obviously very busy. Was fantastic to watch the light changing behind on Place de la Bourse. Yes it\u2019s busy, yes it\u2019s full of kids but it\u2019s a free public space on a hot day so what do you expect! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
          "What a unique attraction: interactive and beautiful! Definitely worth seeing in the daytime, then come back at night -- a totally different feel.",
          "Especially lovely in a warm night! You can often see street performers. A very nice atmosphere THE place to see in Bordeaux",
          "it is super fan for young or old. you have to wait for a while, but then, the fan begins. the kids will love it.",
          "This place is very nice to cool off or to splash around in if you have kids. It changes between about 2cm of water and mist roughly ever 10 minutes. The mist is very refreshing while the 2cm of water are fun to splash around in.",
          "I am amazed, I have walked past several times to find large crowds looking delighted. Can only think that my impression that Bordeaux was a lively place has been exploded by the excitement that seems to be generated by a few mm of water. I am happy that such simple pleasures are",
          "We visited this site twice. It is lovely both in the morning and the evening. Great place for kids to play and get wet on a hot day. Stay a while and you can catch the water when it shoots up as a mist, like an early morning fog. In the evening you can catch the reflection of",
          "Highly recommend a visit to this. It was absolutely beautiful. Best time would be first thing in the morning, when there is no one else around.",
          "One of the must sees in Bordeaux, very cool part of the beutiful esplanad in Bordeaux. Close walk from city center and a beutiful place for pictures.",
          "Its different. Nice to see all the kids splashing about in it during a hot day. Also nice to see the reflections at nighttime.",
          "Had a wonderful experience here and it was all free - just choose a nice warm day to visit but you have got to wait for the water",
          "Whilst essentially a giant paddling pool that automatically drains every so often and sprays a fine cooling mist, people can't seem to resist dipping their toes - its lovely on a hot day and kids will want to slide in, head first so make sure you have a change of clothes handy",
          "Who ever thought of this deserves a medal. It does different things for different people. For children ( and adults) it\u2019s a place to have paddle and cool down. It\u2019s great for photos and when the steam comes out it\u2019s magical. It\u2019s only as the water goes down that you fully see",
          "Loved cooling off in the water and spray. My 10 and 12 year old stayed for about an hour. Then we watched the street dancers.",
          "In the city center, and near the river, you can have a very good picture! If you have children, you can't forget to go there!",
          "Really worth a look. We had 24 hours in Bordeaux and wanted to see this at night. Hot night and was good to cool down in but more than that it was vibrant and alive with people, music, dancing at both ends. Fun with small children but our older teens loved it too.",
          "Great atmosphere especially at night with people of all ages just enjoying themselves either paddling, taking photos or watching street entertainers perform. This area next to the river is a relaxing place to take a picnic to for lunch.....lots of the locals do!",
          "Paddling pool for some, art installation for others. Very impressive, well worth a visit. Kick your shoes off and cool down, take that photo where you capture the shimmering light just right. 5 to 105s will find something to enjoy here.",
          "Our child loved it. A must do when in the City. We went there by night. So much fun! The water mirror looks very clean.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed discovering Bordeaux and a highlight was \u2018la Place de la Bourse faced with \u2018le Miroir d\u2019eau\u2019; what a clever concept, that fun and much needed ( esp in hot weather!)vast area of water where the beautiful buildings of the Place are reflected, differently,",
          "We came here as part of a walking tour and it is beautiful as the pictures show. However, without the sun but still hot, it is full of children playing in the water so therefore impossible to se the reflections. Try to see late at night or out of season.",
          "It was a water park. Lots of fountains and steam. Great for kids to play on a hot day, not so much for us older folks",
          "A popular place for all visitors and locals. If you have kids, take them for a splash... it's the done thing here! The water is very shallow so not dangerous. We visited during 33 degree heat and everyone was dipping their feet to cool off. If you want the \"mirror\" pictures,",
          "Apparently there was great controversy among the people of Bordeaux when the very shallow skim of water was put in front of the old palatial government buildings along the riverbank. There is no question now that it is one of the highlights and gathering spots in Bordeaux for",
          "See the photo on Palace de la Bourse. Two cms of water comes up out of the ground, provides an amazing reflection of the palace (if you catch it at the right time of day) and cycles through by emptying, being dry, misting and refilling. Best interactive feature ever.",
          "We came during the day and found it full of happy children playing. It\u2019s basically a big puddle to splash around in the hot sun. We spent about 15 min here as my kids got bored quickly, but it was worth the quick stop I guess! I can imagine how beautiful it would be at night",
          "A pond at best. I am completely baffled by how many good reviews this attraction has got on both TA and Google. Admittedly we went in the daytime, so didn't see whatever miraculous things happen after dark.",
          "A treat to see this simple effective water feature that kids are really drawn to the effects change with the temperature, breeze and time of day.",
          "We used this twice on a hot Sunday in July. It was always busy and people were having a great time, of all ages! We saw it being cleaned with steam and refilled too which was more exciting than it sounds! Great fun and fully recommend",
          "I\u2019d assumed this attraction would be operating 24/7, but that\u2019s not the case. Several attempts to view it in the morning before the crowds were met with a dried up area. A further attempt was challenged by a huge crowd, so little chance of any decent photos, but on the fifth day",
          "This was a wonderful sight - reflections of the beautiful buildings along with children (of all ages!) having such fun in the water. Just stand and wait for the pool to fill to give the mirror effect - then minutes later the fog mist is greeted with squeals of delight! The",
          "The Water Mirror is a beautiful addition to Bordeaux's riverfront, especially with the classic architecture of the Place de la Bourse as a backdrop. It is very photogenic, especially after sunset.",
          "A curious and inventive creation: make a mirror at floor level buy using a very thin water layer. Purpose: to duplicate, by light reflection, a nice building that used to held Bordeaux stock exchange.",
          "Amazing sight and great view. From the location, one can continue to walk along the river to enjoy the views.",
          "Down by the river is this strip of water which is a magnate for children particularly when hot. Great fun!",
          "Wish we had something like this at home. Lovely to see everyone enjoying it in the sun. Adults and children alike.",
          "It takes different forms of water during the day, sometimes fountains refreshing kids in this heat, and in evening filling up to see beautiful mirror image of place royale",
          "A good hang out place for kids and adults to freshen up on a hot summer day. We ran into different activities happening around water mirror. Happy moments!",
          "The famous water mirror is most beautiful at night. However, we went on a hot day in mid-summer and it was thronged with people of all ages! It\u2019s a very shallow pool and hordes of people splash their feet in it to cool down, The famous mirror effect is better seen after dark,",
          "The Water Mirroe was nice to see, but with it being summer, there were so many people running around in it (don't blame them it was HOT!) you didn't get the full effect. Would look great at night from the other side of the mirror.",
          "Full of people and kids playing in the water! A great spot in the city with vibrant vibes all day long!",
          "great for kids to visit this place. for adults less of an attraction but on a warm day the water might help you cool down",
          "We visited on a day when the tempertures reached 32 degrees, and it was so lovely to walk in the cool water after visiting the Pont de Pierre and Bourse. Lots of families and children playing in the water, so a great atmosphere. We bought an ice cream and laid down on the wall",
          "So much fun! Amazing atmosphere and we even had an impromptu salsa lesson. Think the reflection at night was better than the one we saw in the day.",
          "great to see at night and during the day to fresh up. best place on Bordeaux to take pictures. A must see",
          "Nice to visit as you walk around Bordeaux. Families were enjoying the cool water as it was 95 degrees.",
          "Beautiful installation. Worth going early to avoid crowds. Iconic view of Pont de Pierre and Bourse. Worth waiting 10 mins for the misty water spray. Very cooling in the intense heat too. Remember to put your shoes back on the second you leave the water or you\u2019ll burn your feet",
          "Great on a hot July day. Mirror effect looks great if you can time it right, with all the kids splashing around \ud83d\ude42",
          "The reflections are very beautiful but ruined by children running through. You need to go late in the evening to get the best views.",
          "Very clever the water mirror, a large very shallow pool, possibly only 40mm deep gives a mirror effect so you can see the Place De La Bourse.",
          "When visiting the city of Bordeaux this is the one place not to be missed. The Water Mirror or Le Miroir d'eau will present you a beautiful local scene of children playing on a thin layer of water. A pond like feature by the river. If you're renting a car , the Place de Bourse",
          "This is right along the river and is a great family spot. Little kids playing in the spouting and misting outlets all over this very large area. If you get in the right spot you can get a picture of the water mirror with a reflection of these majestic buildings in the",
          "What a fantastic setting, so simple but very effective. On a hot day what better a way to cool off by removing shoes and letting cold water and spray attend to your feet.",
          "This is a very large paved area - (half a football pitch perhaps), located next to the river, which every half hour or so fills to about an inch depth with water. Providing the wind isn't too strong it gives a pure mirror effect which makes for stunning photographs of the city.",
          "The Water Mirror is a very clever concept that alternately emits a cloud of water vapor or fills to form a film of liquid that reflects the Royal Palace like a mirror (on a calm day). On a hot day, both the mist and the water are a respite from the heat for thronging clouds, and",
          "it seems so simple and yet it is very enjoyable. Just take of your shoes and walk on water :-) Really refreshing with a great view on top!",
          "The water mirror is used by little kids to splash and young couples to gaze into. It's fun and wild during a hot day and romantic, lit up at night. It's free and right next to the river and near a major tram line.",
          "Fun place. The water periodically flattens out as weather allows. People enjoys walking and splashing. It makes for a lively place.",
          "My Picture shows how amazing this place is. It is something that just sets the mood in France. So much beauty in Bordeaux.",
          "The people of Bordeaux are very proud of the water mirror and allow children, adults and pets to jump around the water pool.",
          "Great place to visit, unfortunately, they didn't have the water turned on. Maybe because of the on-going festival. However the fountain is very beautiful",
          "We went out of our way to visit Bordeaux to see the water mirror especially, but not even a drop of water! Highly disappointed.",
          "Many people is amazed at the wonderful mirror reflection of the Palais de la Bourse at night (in June, it is best at 10:30 pm, 30 minutes after sunset). However, I love the day time mirror reflection scene for two reasons: 1) the temperature in the afternoon is warm in June",
          "Sights of Bordeaux are all within walking distance and this sight is worth seeing because it is easy to find and get to. Nice effect at night which is the best time to see but still nice in the day. Only takes a little while to view.",
          "Worth checking out and getting your selfie. Lovely views. A very simple idea but a brilliant effect. Check it out",
          "This is a beautiful feature especially if seen at dusk or when sun has just gone down. The buildings reflect in the water so great for a camera shot. You can also walk in the water as it is only a cm deep. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "On a sunny day this place is stunning. It is very popular with visitors and fortunately big enough that there is plenty of space to get your photos and enjoy the piece.",
          "It\u2019s very well located in downtown area of Bordeaux. A night attraction that you can not miss! Espetacular!",
          "Everybody takes a photo but after that it is just a shallow pond that you can paddle your feet in( and many people do on a warm day!) So take a photo and move on - it is not that exciting.",
          "Good to visit at different times of the day as the changes in light and the changes in water levels lead to different effects",
          "Located by the river, it makes a perfect mirror image of the Bourse even during day light!, worth visiting!!",
          "The elegant buildings of the La Bourse Place reflected in the mirror of water is a pure delight to the eyes. Equaliy beautiful during the day and at night. A must see while in Bordeaux!",
          "If you can catch it without the visitors if gives a mirage like perspective to the backdrop that is La Bourse. The occasional \u2018fog\u2019 is neat. It draws people to it like a magnet night and day, an inspired piece and what will be an enduring pleasure",
          "This is a hoot. It is across from half an old-fashioned square, and the idea is that it reflects the half-square and creates the illusion of a whole square. (It doesn't really, but hey!). It also spouts a fine mist of water regularly, which is fun to wander around in on a hot",
          "Situated next to the river, it is in fact a collection of water vents that leave a layer of water on a stone level surface which reflects the building across the road until the waters drain away, when they are replaced by further spray. When it is sunny, you can get an excellent",
          "If you have the time, it is interesting to watch how this water feature changes. We didn\u2019t splash through the water, but there were plenty of people (not only children!) who did. The mirror effect is amazing, but we found it fascinating to watch the way the water bubbled up and",
          "Created as a night time wow element for tourists the space in front of the Bourse with a thin layer of water appeals to people also in day light. You can get nice pictures of walking on the water or just relax on the terrace even laying down. The river boulevard is busy with",
          "A very cool place to visit in every sense of the word. Slip off your shoes and have a wander or cool down in the heat of the day. Strike a pose and have a photo taken.",
          "Good for photographers. Night is even better apparently. It\u2019s the gateway into the old town so you can walk from here or catch the trams.",
          "The water mirror is a must see when in beautiful Bordeaux. Everyone young and old come to see the changing water cycles at this attraction, walk through it or stand back and watch, it\u2019s a relaxing place to be day or night.",
          "And for adults alike actually. Saw it pond and most. Kids and dogs loved it running around silly. Something similar in my home city.",
          "Really great effect when the water Mists up. You can stand in it but obviously you will get wet. the reflections of the buildings are really great. Recommended",
          "This is a hot area that they turn on mist to cool down. It leaves water which in turn becomes a reflection of the buildings and people. It is mobbed as people want to cool off!",
          "We have visited this mirroir d'eau several times and it is always fascinating, There is also a superb carved stone fountain adjacent, which sometimes sports cones or similar paraphanelia eg gilets jaunes! We would not make a special trip to see it, but if walking in this area of",
          "This is an impressive tourist attraction - about the size of a football pitch set right in front of 300 year old buildings The \u201clake\u201d is an inch or so deep in water and goes though a cycle every half hour or so with a water mist being produced first for a few minutes and then",
          "Very nice unique feature to take in while touring the city. It is in a large open area so never seems to get very crowded.",
          "The Miroir d'Eau or reflecting pool is great to play in during the hot weather as we saw, based on the number of adults and children enjoying themselves. It is across the road from the many beautiful buildings overlooking the river.",
          "I loved this water fountain that reflected the buildings across the way. The fountain at first floods the area than in 10 minutes it has mist coming out and the reflection is a little blurred. This gives the reflection another version of the buildings across the way. Plus on",
          "When in Bordeaux don\u2019t miss this, it\u2019s a perfect spot for photos. Better to go mid week as it\u2019s very busy at the weekend",
          "The 'mirror' is pretty cool, but don't expect to capture the perfect reflection as between it and the lovely Place runs a very busy road. As a result, coaches, lorries, white vans etc rend to spoil the effect. Still worth a visit mind, just be prepared for the blights of City",
          "This makes for a fabulous photo of the Place De La Bourse. The reflection is amazing. Don't miss it!",
          "The waters shimmers in the sun light and on the sunny day we were there the children played in the water....it was sunny but not too warm for this Australian. There are places around where you can sit and enjoy the city the River and the water mirtow",
          "Well, you can snap someone who looks as though they are! Just 2cm of water covers this polished granite surface giving the impression you are walking on water....but be aware of the fountains which spray from time to time!",
          "Fun for everyone of every age. Puts a smile on your face to see the water and the reflections and how happy it makes kids and adults alike.",
          "Watching people of all ages and cultures enjoying the simple pleasure of splashing in water in the afternoon sun opposite the most fabulous architecture. A wonderful way to spend some time while walking alongside the river.",
          "There are a lot of people running through water which disturbs it and makes the mirror shot difficult. But we persevered and got one. Beautiful area for a walk around",
          "Stunning reflective pool which if no one has decided to walk through (sigh) you can get a wonderful photo! Worth a visit.",
          "Any person can become a professional photographer once the night falls, it is a magical scene. Nice for pictures and walking around. many nice restaurants and bars around.",
          "The mirror effect works best when it is still. I took some night photos which I will treasure. Not sure how a smart phone camera would work as I used a DSLR & a tripod.",
          "The location of the mirror could not have been better. It gives us a reflection of the best square in the whole city. When it is windy, the reflection can be a little interrupted, but it is still beautiful. The better weather conditions can give even better result.",
          "A great sight for a clear night. It can be busy so you might need to wait to get a clear photo, but when you do it's worth the wait.",
          "Walked here from town centre and was amazed by the water feature. Probably best visited in spring and summer as you can enjoy getting wet in the 'art'. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited this delightful site because we were advised that down by the river after dark all the bridges are lit up and there are what appear to be something similar to Chinese lanterns all round this area .We stumbled across this mirrored paddling pool and it was full of young",
          "Very relaxing environment. Interesting to watch kids and adults playing on the water suface. A must if visiting Bordeaux.",
          "I'd read about this place and seen pictures on the internet but didn't quite understand what was going on when I arrived. It was raining a little when we got there and we couldn't see a reflection in the water. We figured it was because the light rain was causing a ripple.",
          "Le Miroir d'Eau is a couple of centimetres of water on top of concrete between the promenade on the left bank of the Garonne and the Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux. It reflects beautifully at night though during the day is much less interesting. The Miroir was put in place in",
          "Keep children with skateboards,bikes and toddlers paddling out of this feature,it detracts from what is something novel to admire in the city.Go but be prepared for thoughtlessadults and children,early morning might be best",
          "A nice experience, the kids took their shoes of a went in. The weatjer was nice, there were a lot of people and we enjoyed the view.",
          "It's a simple idea: a shallow rectangular pool of water on the riverside in front of la Place de la Bourse, which it reflects beautifully by day and at night. Unsurprisingly it's popolar with tourists and for photo opportunities.",
          "On a very sunny day, this was lovely to sit beside. Lots of people paddling, it looked clean and fresh. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We went to Bordeaux at the end of March. We were very excited for the water mirror but it wasn't running. The locals said it is turned off during winter.",
          "The play of lights and this \"mirror\" makes the city incredibly unique. Really a great place to visit on your walk.",
          "We were here in the rain so we were able to see the reflection although it was spotty. I am sure it is better when they have water in it. That doesn't happen in the colder weather. The lighting wasn't good for the photo because of the cloudy sky. Looking at photos though it",
          "Worth seeing in daytime and at night. The lighting at night made the reflection a standout. Great views of the Gironde River and Napoleon's Bridge from the river side of the pond. Fortunately the pond was still full in November.",
          "I have a 5 year old daughter and she really loves it. We goes there when ever we can and its really lovely in the afternoon when the sun is not too hot . Bit too crowded sometimes but the kids just loves it, really good place for kids to make new friends. Good place to visit",
          "A dream come true for the kids, prepare the extra clothings, for them and you!!! it's grate to play on it, and to chat around, to watch people interacting, just be sure to go before sunset, water it's freezing cold after that!!!!!!!",
          "Clearly, this much-vaunted photo opportunity site is not a hot ticket in January as its shallow pool is drained and so the mirror ceases to reflect! Tant pis! The copious rainfall afforded us a hint of its reflective potential.",
          "I was looking forward to seeing this 'highlight' of the central Bordeaux tourist experience but it seems to not operate during December. Disappointed! Without the water on there is precisely nothing to see - boo.",
          "This is an awesome place to take photos both day and night. Its well known for the beautiful reflection shots that you can get during the day, but equally amazing night shots can be taken. Loved the place and went back twice.",
          "If you stroll past this in the summer you cannot help but wade into the water. Lovely little place to relax.",
          "Maybe because it is January, or because it was raining... But it was closed. Just an extension of the big square",
          "Walking is a must see place. Better to walk no easy to park Este es un sitio que debe ver y tomar fotos",
          "We were staying round the corner so didn\u2019t have to make a special trip from afar. Nonetheless it was disappointing to discover that the spectacle was not happening due to the cold. Apparently the fountain can not operate in cold conditions as the pipes freeze (although it was",
          "Extremely popular spot and with good reason. Spectacular at night particularly from some of the nearby restaurants.",
          "I went in the summer in the afternoon. It was great fun and I got some good pictures- would recommend going with family or friends.",
          "Must see! Afterwards, quick access to great restaurants, and \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf77\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb MORE GREAT wine! \ud83c\udf77\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Cheers!",
          "Was in Bordeaux for Xmas - super city. Loved it. But this site is best viewed in summer - it\u2019s not a good winter attraction. In summer is so beautiful and it seems to cool you down in the summer heat. But a skip in the winter months.",
          "The mirror fountain was cooling on a warm day and it provided a very interesting alternative view of the wonderful buildings of the Place De La Bourse. Part of a lovely walk along the river with gardens and places to sit.",
          "It\u2019s clean and well-kept. Going in the early morning in the summer is best because there were. A lot of people around lunch time and we didn\u2019t get to see the true reflection of it. Truly was beautiful. Pictures were perfect!",
          "Really wasn\u2019t impressive because it wasn\u2019t working. What can you say, many people looking around, checking their phones to see if they were in the right place looking confused. Less a mirror, than a depiction of the cities care to detail.",
          "The view is amazing day or night. Even before summer, the place is busy with people just hanging around and kids playing in the water.",
          "I have now seen it with summer and winter mist as well as shining like a mirror under the sun and it is mesmerizing as long as there are not cruise ships in the harbor...that makes it hard to see.",
          "This is an amazing sight both day and night. I missed seeing the mists during the day but really enjoyed the reflection of lights at night. Very interesting gathering area for the youth of Bordeaux. Watched a photographer setting up for wedding photos. Fun!",
          "I visited Bordeaux for a long weekend at end Nov and was very disappointed to find the mirror d\u2019eau is the mirror sec over the winter months",
          "No doubt this pool is spectacular on windless and sunny days. Alternatively, the view on the square just before sunset is also nice.",
          "Title says it all Was hoping for fountain like sprays and bit of lighting but all we got was inch deep or so of water, which then drained, and everyone then walked on where it had been. 10 mins later it bubbled back up and produced still water area which acted like a mirror",
          "The Water Mirror is really a thin film of water over concrete slabs. it is so thin, you can walk on nit with street shoes. Kids love to play in it.",
          "Best time to visit for pictures will be in the evening though it can be a little crowded. Examples of pictures in the day and during evening time",
          "The water mirror is really worth the visit easley accessible by tram or walking Would recommend that you go there out of the summer as it gets to crowded, and if you want to get some good photos I would recommend late at night",
          "Blown away by how beautiful this is. A MUST for anyone visiting. We had a perfectly balmy evening and the effect is a sight to behold",
          "Didn't know about this until we walked to the Place de la Bourse. We were lucky with low autumn sunshine and no wind. Interesting reflection play.",
          "A great place for photo enthusiasts. Interesting at different times of day and night. It\u2019s shallow, so you can walk straight across.",
          "This is lovely to visit but unfortunately the non- stop traffic does spoil the effect. Being next to the river you could alway sit with your back to the Miroir and watch the boats ;-)",
          "Beautiful picture spot in the evening. Not a far walk from the action. We were told it is better in the evening.",
          "Took a walk one night along the river and came across the place and the water mirror just on dusk. Wonderful feeling from all who were there enjoying the warm night and sights! Worth a visit, we got some great photos.",
          "conveniently located along the pedestrian walkway, this is interesting during the day, but spectacular at night. worth a night time outing.",
          "Located right across from historic customs house building and by the river the reflecting pool is sight to see. Rises and lowers and on sunny or cloudy days a nice re-elections if the buildings.",
          "We did a walking tour and stopped here to see the scenery. It was a chilly day so we did not stay very long. There many visitors. Some even bikes over this water fountain.",
          "Nice flat and thin surface of water with fumigating waterfalls at regular intervals welcomed in hot summer days reflecting the XVII century facades of Place de la bourse opposite the road. In summer, or week ends, usually it is full of people and famillies. The small problem",
          "My little boy was mesmerised by this and we easily spent 30 minutes just walking in it with him and could have spent more time.",
          "Lovely attraction to visit, worth going in the evening for the reflections. Occasionally the water changes to spray so it looks like fog, then settles down.",
          "The locals seem to love it - and so did we - but I wonder if it's appeal will gradually diminish with familiarity. Never mind - excellent bit of design and construction and good fun.",
          "I wonder how much this feature cost.... the locals seem to like it and so did we but you wonder how long it's appeal will last. Clever bit of design and construction though.",
          "The Water Mirror is a very nice place to visit a the center of Bordeaux. Very relaxing and cool if you visit a hot summet day. Kids and adults alike shower joyfully in the waters of the fountain while your are sitting at a bench and enjoy the view of the river",
          "I did not expect to be impressed, but I loved this clever water feature. It was so cool! People of all ages delighted in the burbling water, the mist, the fog, and then it all clearing away, just to cycle back again. Great photo opportunities. We were so intrigued that we",
          "the Miroir along the river is a great place to people watch and to take in the river scene. Kids run in the water in summer and others just watch the day pass by.",
          "What a great idea through the day in the heat the little kidie and adults alike were in cooling down and in the evening as well, but when it was quiet the reflections of the palace were stunning",
          "The world's largest reflecting pool covers over 3,000 m3. Excellent spot for a quick cooldown on a hot summer day. A very busy city hangout especially for children in the summer holidays. Good with kids.",
          "Having looked up places in Bordeaux beforehand this was the first place we went to. We arrived at an opportune time. The square was full of water and there was no wind to cause ripples. The reflection was spectacular. Having said that coming here other times during our stay the",
          "Stopped to view as we walked along the Riverbank. This is a must see for any visitor to Bordeaux. The water mirror is unique, one minute you have children walking across the water ( it's only 2cm deep) the next minute you have a mist rising from it. With the Place de Bourse in",
          "Every 15 minutes, a fog vapor arises from the granite surface. This is the most photographed site in Bordeaux. At night, the pool reflects the exterior lighting at the Place de la Bourse (it's like the Parliament Buiding in Budapest, but smaller). It was built in 2006 and",
          "What a relaxing place for a nice evening walk or chatting with friends close to the waterfall!! Will be back for this beauty again!!!",
          "A nice spot to take some photos. Not good as the sun sets as it will be in your face. Worth a visit.",
          "An enjoyable place to spend a few minutes or a few hours on a warm September's afternoon. There are a lot of people enjoying the cool mist and unusual visual effects of this unique free attraction in Vieux Bordeaux.",
          "We went here during the day. It\u2019s best to wait until there is lots of water and probably at dusk when you get the light reflecting.",
          "This is a must to visit in Bordeaux. Absolutely stunning at night with the reflections of the lighted buildings around!!",
          "This unique fountain, on the water but in the middle of town, is a can't miss spot in Bordeaux. No admission, no lines.. just stop by and watch the young kids have their fun... or better yet, be adventurous and venture \"into\" the water. (removal of shoes is the only",
          "How good is this? Brilliantly sited on the river bank the water spray is an amazing attraction and the mirror finish something to behold. A very bold statement for a rejuvenated city.",
          "Enjoyed seeing the different reflections and watching dogs, bikes and people walking and paddling in the pool.",
          "Children, adults and dogs seem to love this place. Fun to watch everybody having a good time. Nice setting along the river.",
          "It's a nice place enjoyable either with kids or with adults also all alone. My favorite place in Bordeaux.",
          "Definitely a must see in Bordeaux both in the day time and at night. Lot of events happening during the day and night around this area too",
          "The Water Mirror is not only a creative piece of public space but an interesting and entertaining amenity for this charming city. Positioned along the river front it is a large, flat platform that produces a light mist during the day so that kids and adults can walk or run",
          "Supposedly, this is the top attraction in Bordeaux. I was there for two days this past weekend. The first day, there was no reflection. The second day, there was not even any water!",
          "This is a must to visit..superb idea. Great by day with the mist and water..at night it becomes magical , with the beautiful lights reflected..can stay for ages just enjoying people having fun..",
          "After good food and wine head here to see this famous Bordeaux attraction. During the day it\u2019s very hard to take decent photographs but as night falls it becomes magical. Wait around to witness the mist and the water and take hundreds of photographs.",
          "Pleasant surprise when walking from Citee Du Vin to La Bourse. Enjoyable, cooling distraction on a hot day. Entertaining to watch the children play in the mist of the water spouts that pop up unexpectedly. Great photo op, also of the Bourse just across the street,",
          "Great place to view the river or take shots of the Bourse. Young children will enjoy removing their shoes and running through it.",
          "came across the water mirror whilst strolling along the rivereside. great evening ambience with groups of all ages sitting picnicing in amongst the wonderful garden planting next to the mirror. Again early in the morning the mist rises off of the water with people tiptoeing",
          "An amazing photo opportunity. certainly one of the most famous photo attractions of Bordeaux. Always busy, but late at night, after dinner and wine, (most of the crowds are gone) stroll past here, enjoy the views and a great way to cap off what was a great day",
          "We had never heard of the Miroir d\u2019Eau before our hotel receptionist pointed it out on the map. It is apparently the world\u2019s largest reflecting pool and is located on the quayside of the River Garonne in front of the Bourse. We had a very enjoyable stroll along the river-side",
          "This was quite the experience because when we visited Bordeaux it was 38C. It felt like the whole city was there trying to keep cool...excellent attraction in the core of the city.",
          "A huge, and impressive installation, this fountain is well worth a visit when In Bordeaux. If you make it on a hot summer evening, even better; it seems to refresh the environment around it. Take it in together with a stroll along the landscaped left bank of the river. Easy to",
          "Ever seen anything like this before! It\u2019s great. Watching adults splash around like children as they wait for the mist is amazing A MUST see in Bordeaux",
          "This was an amazing sight which took us by surprise as we walked along the river Garonne. Picturesque when it is still with a mirror like finish, but amazing when the mist rises! Must see!!!",
          "It is lovely to see families enjoying the 2cm of water spread over a large area. There were people pushing pushchairs in the water, and children rolling around in it. After a long while it changed to mist and that was very special. It made for great photos.",
          "The water mirror is a very unique fountain we went on a Sunday many people come with their children and they run on the water mirror and have fun. It gives also an illusion that it is part of the river",
          "A good thing to see. The reflection created is wonderful though it was affected by a number of people walking through it on a warm night. part of a wonderful promenade on the river of Bordeaux.",
          "I didn't know a thing about this 'instillation' before driving passed it. Our holiday was in the countryside. We had landed in Bordeaux and hired a car to drive to our destination so had done NO research about this city or its attractions. We didn't understand why so many",
          "Haven\u2019t seen something like this before and found it fascinating. It is centrally located so we went back three times to see it at different times of the day. Certainly gets of interest with lots of people milling about. The water comes up then drains and then mists. A fun thing",
          "This ia such a good idea to bring life and community to the centre of the town. Kids were cooling down in the pool during the day and the mirror reflection against the buildings is stunning at night. Why dont more cities do this?",
          "Miroir d'Eau is a massive water mirror separating Place de la Bourse from the river. We captured some amazing images of the water mirror at sunset. The eeriest images were when artificial misting was pumped out of the granite slab. A must see attraction in Bordeaux and its",
          "We recommend seeing this attraction - great on a hot day with the water and water vapours. It's not exactly rocket science, but an interesting attraction.",
          "Shoes off and just splash about in the shallow water bubbling up from holes in the ground - a great way to cool down - all cities should have one.",
          "Great attraction - would recommend - along water line lots of restaurant - water mirror good for photos and lovely at night",
          "It is a nice place to spend time. It is besides river Garonne. In the summer it helps a lot with the water. Refreshs the place. Children walk there",
          "It\u2019s fantastic how water can effect people. This place is a great place for visiting and just walk around barefoot to cool down. Well worth a visit and a must in Bordeaux. Take of your shoes and relax and enjoy life together with all the rest.",
          "A must see in Bordeaux. A bit disappointed during the day as people decided it would be great to paddle in...a bit off putting when trying to admire the reflections. A bit bah humbug of me perhaps. However, totally different at night especially with all the ambient lighting",
          "A beautiful water feature, with two inches of water where people can wade in and relax! Especially transformed at night time!",
          "This is a public area that offers a nice place to relax and frolic in the water when the weather is hot.",
          "It\u2019s a classic site in Bordeaux and so worth the walk to enjoy it. Especially at night time with the beautiful glowing lights. It\u2019s a short stroll from most of the places in the city. Go there!",
          "Beautiful landscape architecture. This place is definitely worth a visit. The water starts approx. every ten minutes.",
          "We stumbled across with attraction whilst walking around Bordeaux. Our 2 year old absolutely loved playing it and what started out as a gentle paddle ended up with just wearing her nappy and wading through the water on her stomach! So much fun! Beautiful scenery too and love the",
          "A must-see in Bordeaux. Plan to be there at dusk. We were fortunate that the moon was rising over the Bourse during the show",
          "Gigantic concrete/slate area covered with (an inch or two) thin layer of water. Mist shoots out of tiny water holes every 15 minutes or so, makes appearance of fog. Great to cool off in the peak of summer; it was in the high 80's/low 90's when we were there. The place was",
          "This is a great spot in the summer when you want to cool off. The mist and water spraying is very calming despite the kids running around everywhere. You have to move to the far end and wait for the water to cease moving to catch the reflection of the buildings. Giving it the",
          "Refreshing to dip your feet in and chill out for a bit. It has two sessions one is water on the mirror and the other is a mist effect. Lots of people taking pictures during the most effect.",
          "Another spectacular asset on the Bordeaux wAterfront. I'm not sure they should but children love playing in it!",
          "As a piece of art, it excels, as a place of beauty, hard to miss, as a go to place for people watching, it\u2019s a must, wonderful vision, clever interpretation has created a contemporary monument for the amazing city of Bordeaux - participate, engaging and energising -",
          "I recommend going late, when most have gone home, so that you can enjoy this in all of it's glory and without distraction. By late I probably mean closer to midnight, if you wait until 2am many of the lights will be out and it won't be as glories as it can be. In order to get",
          "Loved it here. Nice view of the river and square. Fun to paddle in and also walk through the mist which is turned on occasionally",
          "This is s must do stop when visiting Bordeaux. Great fun idea. We visited middle of the day but would have wanted to see early morning when it would have been less busy and also at night to see the reflection of the lights.",
          "It was very hot on our day trip to Bordeaux so this place was a welcome treat to cool our feet!! My 3 year old loved splashing in the water! Lots of families were enjoying the attraction, I particularly loved when the water drained and the mirror effect was more visible.",
          "In a fifteen minute cycle this enormous water feature changes from a wet paved area to a paddling experience to a cooling mist which rises to about three feet which looks and is fun for all the family, particularly on a hot day. Include it in your walk around the city",
          "It's a great place where to go on a hot summer day. The water is clean and it is fun since it produces either fog or a stream of water to cool your feet",
          "Luckily, this construction is for free and close to the major tourist attractions. Lots of fun for kids on a hot day, but consequently, a mirror without a reflection...",
          "Creates very good mirror or mist effect to photograph the Place de la Bourse against in the morning. Also greys to cool down on a hot day.",
          "Worth a look children will love it. Gentle spray mist you can walk on water. Refreshes regularly in a pleasant area centre of town.",
          "On a quiet day this is probably quite impressive. However, on a hot day it appeared to me to be just a big puddle with lots of kids running around. Fun for them, but it meant you couldn't see the reflection of the buildings opposite.",
          "nothing like the photos . no reflection. lost of kids in the water - its a giant paddling pool. they should make some time every hour when everyone should leave the watwr so you can see the effect as intended.",
          "We visited here the other night and it was a great spot to sit and soak in Bordeaux. There were lots of people sitting around eating and drinking and the pictures over the mirror were great",
          "The 'Miroir d'eau' (water mirror) opposite Place de la Bourse is just so much fun!! \ud83d\ude1c From mist, to pool, to mirror, I can really see why the biggest crowds (esp kids\ud83e\udd38) gather around this extraordinary attraction. \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udca6",
          "Good vibe, lotsof going on around the Water Mirror, dance classes, arobic, people are very relaxed and enjoyed the atmosphere. It is a fun place.",
          "The largest water mirror in Europe I think, this was a good experience, great fun to walk about on a hot day with bare feet!",
          "A great relaxing break into a day of sightseeing in Bordeaux historic district, a UNESCO world heritage site, especially enjoyable in the summer. Young and old get to kick-off their shoes and enjoy the barefoot experience of the cool water covered terrace, which changes from",
          "Sadly we only got to see The Water Mirror in the day, however it is still very impressive and a wonderful area to visit. Children especially will enjoy. It's perfectly located by the River Garonne. The Water Mirror changes between having a shallow layer of water on it to then",
          "After our driver explained what this was, my wife and I were interested enough to take a stroll after checking into our hotel. When we arrived, there was quite a bit of water with lots of children running, splashing, and generally having a great time. As we were about to leave,",
          "The water mirror is a very shallow water pool used to enjoy surrounding reflected in it and foe enjoy bare feet walking in water. The day time reflections are strengthened during twilight and night when the lights are added to the celebrations of the reflections. During twilight",
          "GET a free shower with vaporized water, funny and cooling down on hot temperatures... Nice place to walk around also...",
          "We have spent over five summers in Bordeaux and still love to spend time at and take guests to Miroir d'Eau. It was the scene for one of our favorite winter holiday cards - my husband and I delighting in the mist. I love to watch kids (and adults) waiting for then delighting",
          "I think this is probably the most famous landmark of Bordeaux and there is a reason for that. There is a very thin layer of water and at night you can see the reflection of the lighted monument in front and its very very beautiful...",
          "Our Granddaughter loved this, and we went every day. If you're staying near St Jean Station, get the C Tram. It is also near the BATCUB boats.",
          "Lovely idea and a must see place. Visit this place in the evening. Really beautiful. Highly recommended especially when the mist comes up from the floor!!",
          "If you want to go and see a water mirror this is not the place for you, especially in the summer, but If you have young kids this is not to be missed. This was the highlight of our trip for my kids, they loved running around in what is basically a massive paddling pool and were",
          "The Water Mirror or Miroir d'eau is a beautiful shallow reflecting pool! Located across from Place de la Bourse it almost magically alternates a mirror effect and artificial misting in a special way. Every 15 minutes mist is created and shot up from the ground and then water",
          "My husband was keen to see this wonder but when we got there is was simply a sunken expanse of pavement with water in which children and adults were rolling and playing in. There was nothing 'mirror like' about it while people were allowed into it.",
          "A very nice way to get your feet wet and to beat the heat. Almost wish I had brought a swimsuit :) Located in front of Place de La Bourse. A great attraction for everyone.",
          "Our kids had a lovely time running, jumping and enjoying the mist coming out from the floor. They loved it and we did too.",
          "We went here with our kids aged 6&8. In the baking summer heat, this is a much needed stop off point. It is always very busy but there is space for everyone to feel some water on their feet! There are always acts going on on the promenade, so you can alternate between cooling",
          "Possibly because of the heat wave my kids had a great time and as it was also French holiday season the place exploded into life later in the Saturday evening. (our third visit of the day!) As adults we could relax with a drink as everyone else was and they were happy all the",
          "Beautiful idea! Busy during the day with kids cooling off which was cool to see but night is beautiful and we saw some kids doing wheelies the whole way across",
          "You really need to go in winter when it is dark. So was very no point to see it during the day or night in summer. lots of kids running, screaming in the water. Some naked. Saw kids weeing around water.",
          "this was lots of fun to see all of the families, couples, etc., enjoying the water mirror on a hot summer night.",
          "The idea of the mirror is amazing, however we went twice to try and see this, but the area was full of people and kids rolling around, so you couldnt see anything. Great if you have kids who want to run around in water.",
          "You are between the Garonne River and these gorgeous buildings along the quays and the Miroir d'Eaux mists up so your legs get wet, the moisture is in the air, cooling you off and it's a lovely way to relax, cool off and have pretty views.",
          "Went here the 2 evenings were in Bordeaux. Our 3 year only loved it! The water goes in a cycle, so it floods, then goes to form the mirror effect, evaporates, mist and then floods again. Loads of family from all walks of life use it, makes it lots of fun. Not just families use",
          "With the misting and the water pool, this attracts loads of families to spend time, as well as those just passing through. It\u2019s a great use of space and worth the visit, especially on a hot day.",
          "Said to be a major attraction but took a long time for anything to actually happen. Not really sure what was due to take place and, when it actually did, was not as impressive as expected.",
          "If you would like to see this AS A WATER MIRROR, then I guess you should visit in January. Otherwise, it is simply a big, shallow wading pool containing a large number of people.",
          "A perfect place to take your shoe's off and cool the feet on a very hot day. Great for the kids to run around in and cool off.",
          "Kids and dogs and everyone cavorting in cooling mist. Kept us going til we found a cab. There is a taxi rank at the top of Rue Espirit de Lois, opposite the Grande Theatre.",
          "A beautiful range of mirror, mist and lake for all to enjoy. Perfect for a family to see on a hot day and stunning at sunset, a really beautiful part of Bordeaux and a must see here!",
          "A lovely feature in the city. Lots of people and children cooling off and playing in the water. It is a nice water feature near the boardwalk and very nicely done. Worth looking at.",
          "This is an interesting space and I\u2019m sure looks fabulous in the right lighting but in the middle of the afternoon on a hot day it\u2019s a tad busy, and ultimately it\u2019s just a big wet expanse of smooth concrete. Let the kids run through the water mist etc for sure but I wouldn\u2019t go",
          "If you have a half hour to kill in Bordeaux, this is a nice soot. It's very central with parking nearby and the kids love splashing about in the water",
          "A great place to cool off with the kids for a while. Our three enjoyed running around and splashing after walking the streets of old town. We got some great photos there as well. Maybe take a change of clothes for the kids or even a swimming costume as we had to head back home",
          "The Water Mirror is a must see for everyone visiting Bordeaux. Watching small children enjoying the water and steam in the bright sunshine is a joy. The water and steam are also a great pleasure for the not so young.",
          "The Water Mirror is a pretty new attraction made about 10 y ago in front of the famous and most beautiful Bourse Sq. It quickly became city's famous spot for meeting and hanging around. The water in stone block pavements comes in and out in cycles, so you have to be patient to",
          "The water is two centimeters deep ( less then an inch). Everyone frolics in it, water sprays up from time to time and the next it diisappears for a bit. Like a walk about pool with little water.",
          "dont leave to the children have a go its awesome--and colling when the temp is 35+,it was great to see families couples dogs and all enjoying somthing that is so simple",
          "The Miroir d'Eau, alongside Pont de Pierre, is probably the most iconic landmark of modern-day Bordeaux so I had to visit. In fact, I visited several times during my stay always seeking a view of the mirror effect against the Bourse Palace. Alas it was impossible during the",
          "We went there twice. One in the afternoon around 6pm and the other time was around 9:00pm. The first time we were there, we enjoyed the water fountain spray and the misty effect but couldn't take a good shot of the Mirror d'eau reflection. So we decided to go back again after",
          "To many children to get the mirror effect . Go there in the evening to see the mirror or during the day with small kids if you like the splashing.",
          "We went two nights in a row. And there are these hip hop dancers on the plaza at around 10pm every night. They're quite good.",
          "I went with my French friend for a lovely day in Bordeaux. We stopped at the Water Mirror quite early in the morning before it got too busy. Absolutely lovely, Bordeaux has really changed since I was there 20 years ago, so many new and fabulous things to see and do!",
          "Whoever designed this work of art is a very clever and imaginative person.It really is a mirror made from stone and water. The spraying of mist gave it an almost mythical quality. Kids will love it. It is also a great way to cool off on a hot day like today.",
          "Good location for photo opportunity. You can also enjoy people, especially kids playing, dancing. A must see while in Bordeaux.",
          "The water mirror runs in about 15 minute cycles, so you need to plan on staying at least that long. It floods and creates the mirror, then drains, and mists for 5 minutes. Great for photos and cooling off. Unique.",
          "Beautiful, innovative, interactive and lots of fun - if you're a water-lover, this is for you. In heat of the summer during the daytime half of the city's children seem to come here to play and cool down; the evening, the refection from the water surface is quite stunning.",
          "Kids love cooling off here. Bathing suits are helpful but not necessary. Bordeaux gets hot in the summertime. This place can cool you off.",
          "Nice place in the centre of Bordeaux near the River site to cool down - especially on a hot day. Easy to find",
          "Plenty of people making use of the mirror pool, children loving it. Looked good at night with mist coming off.",
          "a thin layer of water turns this monumental square into a gigantic playground where children and adults can have fun. A must-see when in Bordeaux",
          "Although stunning at night, it was also great fun to walk through on a hot day! Lots of children playing as well as adults!",
          "In the summer warmth, it becomes a huge paddling & play pool so one doesn't really get the 'mirror' effect, but at dusk it is beautifully lit by the lights along the river and surrounding buildings.",
          "We arrived at the docking point for our wine cruise and saw that there was a wine festival.We weng to the stalls and suddenly we saw the water fountain and the water mirror.It was such a nicd experience .Be there before 17.00 and enjoy",
          "Really fascinating effect with this fountain, acts just like a mirror and then sprays very fine mist like fog",
          "By day refreshing, by night stunning particularly when the smoke came on and when it got quieter it was great to photo.",
          "This is a beautiful experience for water to flow and create a reflection mirror in front of the historic buildings of downtown Bordeaux. And the water evolves through mist and fountain and still. An early morning visit is in your best interest.",
          "When there are not many people and the water has not evaporated it is really beautiful. But outside theee times it\u2019s difficult to appreciate it",
          "A bit of fun and great to cool down as it was so hot but you do have to time it right as the steam seems fairly infrequent.",
          "Very nice people seems to enjoy the water there. It is used in summer as a public swimming pool. Can be crowdy at some time",
          "A fun place for young and old. Kick off your shoes (or wear swimmers). A great way to cool off on a hot afternoon. Fountains cycle through different settings regularly.",
          "One of the best contemporary landscape architecture projects from around the world! Beautiful place to take pictures in the morning or evening.",
          "So the fountain cycles through empty, mist, water spray, and pond. It is beautiful through the water cycles but especially when it becomes a pond and the reflection shows the Palace Royal. Watching the kids play in the water on hot days was neat too.",
          "Bordeaux lacks activities for little kids so this is a must-do! Our daughter absolutely loved it and we went back several times! Not enough shade, though, so avoiding the middle of the day is good!",
          "Kids loved visiting the water mirror and so did I, got a chance to have some silly fun with them. I would recommend bringing some swimwear for the kids and a towel. Only down side is I thought the water shot up out of the ground but it doesn't it's more like a mist then gradual",
          "Great location by the waterfront. We saw this feature by day and by night. It's crazy to see how big of a space it is; simple beauty.",
          "Fine mists sprayed at regular intervals. Fun not only for kids but people of all ages to chill and cool down during the hot summer. Great spot for nice photos.",
          "Quite a feat really as the multiple fountain sprays create a mirror effect on the ground. In the heat you'll see people walking barefoot and children playing and/or pretending to swim on it.",
          "This is a unique feature of Bordeaux and is a paved area covered by a film of water. This is excellent for reflective photography producing beautiful mirror image pictures. The highlight is for the kids who can play in the shallow water and wait for the multitude of mini",
          "Yes it is worth the visit. A beautiful place to spend some time, particularly in the evening. A great place for a picnic.",
          "A really nice concept, a thin layer of water that easily reflects and mirrors everything around it. If it is a hot day of summer, take off your shoes and cool yourself off by walking on it.",
          "As the heat rises in the City head to the Water Mirror and let the gentle fizz of water from the jets cool you down and bring you back to life! A beautifully simple addition to a cityscape ( They should have them everywhere ) you can cool down and watch the kids splash around",
          "We were intrigued by the use of water and the enjoyment it gave to young and old. A new addition to the Place de la Bourse.",
          "Great to see especially on a hot day. Many kids running around. Beware...it\u2019s slippery..little kids were falling all over the place ..whacking their heads. Nice to see people relaxed with shoes off walking in the water and occasional mist. Watching a dog play in the water was",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect, it's a great place to cool yourself and quite picturesque. No fountains of water but a great crowd-pleaser",
          "View the iconic Bourse (the bhilding that IS Bordeaux) from the water mirror. At night the view is stunning during the day you will see the children of Bordeaux at play in the mirror basin as the water feature goes through its cycle. Great fun!",
          "This is a pretty area with lovely architecture and fun for the kids to run in the water vapour and spray.",
          "Stunning reflective effect. Great photo opportunity. People walking in the mist when it goes off a lot like something from The Walking Dead.",
          "During school holidays, this is very popular in hot days. At night, it is worth waiting to 10pm in summer time to get great mirror photographs.",
          "I\u2019d read about it and then as was walking by saw all the fog! Absolutely loved it and the water was very welcome in the 30 degree heat!!",
          "Great fun for the kids splashing about in on a hot day. Thus any artistic effect is lost. Superb location beside the river.",
          "Toddlers to pensioners can take off their shoes and paddle in this shallow 'pond' only an inch deep. With the river on one side and the imposing buildings of the Place Royale on the other, it is relaxing and fun.",
          "So lovely to walk through this water feature on a hot day in this wonderful city. Enjoy a wonderful view of the river from this location.",
          "It\u2019s just a patch of water on the pavement- but can be transformed in an instant to a great play area for young and old! In the past I\u2019ve seen students having races sliding across it; this trip, as it was a warm day, families with young children were using a great time splashing",
          "This site is a must to include in your photographs of Bordeaux. It is centrally located and worth seeing.",
          "It sounds a bit naff really but does provide an unusual view (the reflection) of some very attractive buildings on the waterfront. You are bound to go near it so make sure you see it and look out for the times it does different thing!",
          "Well worth a look as it blends really well with the amazing UNESCO listed architecture. Best seen as part of general wandering rather than a specific trip though.",
          "It\u2019s a simple idea executed to perfection! Take a very large, flat rectangul beside the Garone river and turn it into a shallow pool. Pump an inch of water into it, then let it drain away leaving a flat, wet surface that reflects the buildings one way, or the river the other",
          "The beautiful structures on Place de la Bourse together with the \"special fountain\" by the side of waterfront make a \"mirror\" effect on the buildings. Ejection of mist, water and the calm effect on the fountain create different atmosphere around. The place is more attractive",
          "One of the most famous symbols of contemporay Bordeaux. Multiple low level fountains at various times change the effect of the water mirror.",
          "This is not a feature that you would travel specialy to see. Its only one feature on the waterfront. Its nothing special however it does add to the overall picture of a very nice city.",
          "In front of the Place de la Bourse and very popular with locals and tourists, watch the change from mist fountain to water which creates the mirror effect particularly good a night with the reflection from the lit up Bourse building, although our visit had a clear evening sky",
          "Brilliant Great, free, fun for kids and families of all ages. The boys (3 under 5) loved it. Great atmosphere with the Bordeaux Fete Le Vin on while we were visiting.",
          "Great place to walk at night, and lots of people around. Beautiful and great photos to take. It is a \"MUST\" go to place.",
          "During the day there are kids really enjoying themselves running across the large rectangular area the water mirror covers and when the small fountains of water are turned on then the fun really begins! Total turnround after dark as the fountains are not on and what you have is",
          "You need some patient and luck to get the best photo of it, but still good enough for just chill or walk around the square.",
          "Loved this installation of water, light reflecting & everyone enjoying. Recommend. Take the time to walk & look & be there.",
          "Lots of building fences covered lot of the view. Could be nice without building activity. Will check next time in Bordeaux",
          "It is locate din a really nice area and is not something I have seen before. You can enter the \"pool\" with your feed and cool off if hot weather. There are plenty of children playing in the water so it is also good to entertain the young ones (if you don't mind them getting wet).",
          "Beautiful spot and unleashes the inner child as one can walk through the changing water features. Great to see people of all ages enjoying the evening together in gorgeous Bordeaux!",
          "I went twice in one day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon, I recommend going in the morning before you have your coffee or breakfast. There won't be as many people and you can get great pictures. Absolutely love the art in this city.",
          "An obvious tourist attraction, it is next to the water front with other things to see. Lots of people were there, but it didn't feel crowded. There are plenty of cafes nearby to quench your thirst and beautiful, historical buildings all around.",
          "Had to be patient to see a clear reflection. Didn\u2019t capture the night scene as the sky was still bright at 10pm.",
          "Was a real feast to the eyes and very innovative. Also really loved the big groups of young people picnicking in the area",
          "We came here after strolling through the town centre. Lovely building with this water mirror feature in front across the road; great for photos, but difficult not to capture the passing traffic.",
          "Lovely photo opportunity here just make sure you arrive early morning before the crowds arrive. Some beautiful gardens nearby too to sit in",
          "This is a fun place for everyone - a very shallow water area to cool your tired feet! A beautiful spot to people watch.",
          "A must see when in Bordeuax. Especially worth seeing at sunset and in the evening. A very happening place with many tourists and people around socialising.",
          "It's a great water feature that kids can play in on a sunny day on the river promenade. Worth the walk to see.",
          "This is one of most beautiful squares in Europe. Come to see it at sunset. Excellent photo opportunity.",
          "Great to see families - adults and kids- having such fun in this water spectacle on the riverbank. Shows off historic wealth of the \"Bourse\"",
          "Everyone passes by this nice attraction at night and says how beautiful it is, however I passed by it in the day time and it was so much fun especially when you see all the children walking in the water in their bare foot, it was nice in a simple way",
          "Our first time in Bordeaux as a family and all four of us loved this beautiful attraction. Lovely in daytime but spectacular during the nights.",
          "Spectacular granite paved area forming the base of a very shallow lake, no more than a few inches deep. Great for kids and adults to splash or wade in! The water is drained via hidden outlets every little while and then a network of jets spray a mist of water a metre into the",
          "I love this water mirror especially when the water comes out in form of mist I was advised by the guide that the water mirror was the largest in Europe",
          "2 years ago i visited Bordeaux daytime. This time i spend 3 days in this beautiful city! My wish was to visit the water mirror in the evening. What a complete different view on the city!! Definately worth to stop for a while during a romantic walk along the Garonne river",
          "Often full of kids (and older folks) a wonderful centrepiece for the river promenade. Good to watch, especially when the magical mist comes.",
          "Not to be missed (or is that mist?). A great gathering point, with lots of people at play and often street theatre, music, dance acts to enjoy too.",
          "As the night falls, people gather to take photos of the reflection of Palais Royale in the \"mirror\". The gardens are full of young people enjoying picnics, there is a fantastic vibe in Bordeaux.",
          "Lovely hot day in May. Spent a little time in Bordeaux before heading to the airport. We were on a rugby trip to nearby Martignas-sur-Jalle. Saw this large flat space, so why not play a quick rugby match (perhaps not as was intended). Good fun and well worth the walk if you",
          "We arrived in the rain and it messed with the reflection, but as the water drained it got much better. Once it was all drained, the mist started, which was cool. Then water started gurgling up to create the mirror again. Be patient, and watch the whole circuit.",
          "When the light were turned on our river cruise ship left the dock so we could get a better view of the lights. so technicality it wasn't the water mirror because we were off shore but it still had the same effect of a great view",
          "Fun place to visit for children during the day, or adults at night. The water reflects the buildings in the area.",
          "On beautiful days you see all of the Bordelais with their children walking barefeet on this sculpture just in front of the Garonne river.",
          "If it's up and running, this is the greatest invention ever. Like if you only see one thing in Bx this is it. You can walk around it and take all kinds of cool pix. I just deplore the fact that, even as a fluent French speaker, the information about opening and closing seasons",
          "It was breezy so no mirror effect but we enjoyed watching people of all ages paddling in the shallow water.",
          "The mirror is funny and you will enjoy making photos for Instagram there also looking on other people trying not to fall into the water is just pure fun.",
          "This reflection pool is a MUST to see when you visit Bordeaux France.There are different stages to see: 1) No water 2) Apx an inch of water. It is fun to pretend to dance and kick at the water.See youtube for a couple dancing the tango in this pool. 3) More water Notice your",
          "The Mirror is really beautiful. I can imagine this place is like glass. Unfortunately for us, the weather did not cooperate - too much wind and rain to really see a reflection. Despite that, it really was beautiful.",
          "Although the depth is only about 2 inches, the actual depth and the allusion are very different. Watching someone walk across it definitely looked like she could walk on water. Worth a quick stop!",
          "A lovely idea, it really is like a mirror. Great at night with the lights. I expect it would be lovely in the summer too.",
          "The fountain is a great place to meet friends and sit by the river. At night it is transformed into something totally spectacular. The light and the water combined made this a must for people visiting Bordeaux.",
          "It\u2019s as if the ground has dry ice when I saw it. You see heads bouncing in a low slung fog. There are great bike hookups everywhere. This is one of them.",
          "Mirror reflecting laughing kids and all the massive buildings. Unexpected attraction with many faces",
          "In case you're looking for history museum (vin of course) you should visite Bordeaux!! \"la grosse Cloche\" \"Grand Th\u00e9atre\" \"ave St Caterine\" \"place du parlement, utopia, etc...\" and lots of places where ou can drink a biere or a coffe and have a lunch for 2 at less than 55euros\"",
          "I think this is a case of advertising over substance. The buildings and area are beautiful but the water mirror itself is something and in reality nothing. I was disappointed.",
          "This is just beyond a tram station, as the weather had improved drastically everyone seemed to be there cooling down in the sun. Children laughing and playing adults walking bear foot - it was a delightful sight!",
          "There is usually a thin film of water over the stone slabs, reflecting the symmetrical buildings of the Bourse. Intermittently, vapour rises from the spouts, and then more water flows across, and everyone takes a paddle, or skates or cycles across (dogs like it, too). Does not",
          "The mirror effect is great, if when you arrive the water is rippling wait and the water will stop and gradually drain away to give you the mirror effect, that is followed by fine misty sprays which are amazing. The only thing I didn't like was that there were weeds growing out",
          "This will be part of your walk along the river embankment. It is worth stopping to watch the children playing in a large expanse of intermittent fine water spray arising from the paving stones like mist. Impressive but not really for adults.",
          "I had never seen a structure like this. It was a child magnet and also a meeting point for the Bordeaux community. It also presented a variety of photo opportunities. Definitely worth a visit especially if it is a warm day.",
          "Even though the water was cold, saw many children and adults enjoying fountain, as it is very shallow. Must be wonderful on a hot day.",
          "Definitely would see this, especially nice at night!!!! Highly recommended!!! A must see!!!! Beautiful",
          "This attraction, located across from the \"Royal Square\", was inaugurated in 2006 and is shut down during winter to preclude damage due to cold temperatures. As we visited in early March the \u201cmirror\u201d was not in operation, but the photos that can be seen are phenomenal.",
          "Mornings and evenings are best to be here to get some lovely photos. Kids would live this spot .. No doubt, this is best spot to spend time to enjoy the sunset.",
          "Have seen this in rain, wind and sun, the image is lost with too much rain but can still be seen. The water is switched off in winter because of frost so do not make a special trip to see it then. However on a sunny day it is stunning!",
          "stunning reflection of the royal palace on the water mirror at night should not be missed. absolutely stunning...! point to note, they may drain the pond at night...",
          "Evidently this is the largest water mirror in the world, and perfectly reflects the buildings of the Place de la Bourse. It is not flat like a pond all of the time, but fills on a cycle which also includes steam production. We visited when a party of young, excited, school",
          "We had read that this mirror is made of granite slabs covered with a thin layer of water 2 cm deep, the installation creates a fog effect every 15 minutes.. However we were unlucky... as we could not see the effect! We visited this place in March during winters and found out",
          "It makes a real amazing thing on this square...it is really beautiful once the water is gone... Definitely a stop you have to make when visiting Bordeaux! Works only during spring and summer time though so be aware of this",
          "Although there was no water when we first visited, we came back later in the day and it was perfect.",
          "Worth a visit but to see it in full flow you'd need to go during the summer. Very artistic. Most of the real work happens below ground in the storage tanks but it's all very clever work.",
          "The reflection pool is on the must-see list and it is interesting but only for one cycle of the waterworks. It will be crowded with kids and harder to appreciate what is happening from an engineering point of view but you will understand. Check a website for the specs, they are",
          "There is a flat square that they flood with water each night however it looks more like an ice skating rink so kids are playing in it. However late in the evening with very few people around the water is still and reflects the lights in the square and gives an amazing appearance.",
          "You have to be lucky with the weather and sun, because otherwise you won't see the water as mirror. However, the square is nice to walk around.",
          "Beautiful and unique place to visit right next to the river. When I saw it the weather was chilly and the mirror area was misty and looked like a fog was coming up from the walkway surrounding the people.",
          "Well when you have to water the water mirror doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know if it was due to the inclement weather coming in from Siberia or not in early March but there was no water so no water mirror!",
          "it's really a great view, looking the facades of the Boulevard and the Place de la Bourse from the riverfront accross the waters of this large field-fountain. Bordeaux at its best.",
          "Sadly didn\u2019t get to see the water mirror on during my 4 day break as the marathon was Saturday, but still a marvellous site.",
          "August was a perfect time to see this huge Water Mirror. Would love to see it at nighttime!! Lots of great photo ops.",
          "Not open in winter-pretty, still, but nowhere near the same without the mirror effect. Definitely pretty views from here across the river and of the palace, though, so still worth the trip!",
          "Stunning views of the Bourse square and you can chill out by the pond that turns into a water mirror then disappears and turns into mist where you can run after your friends and / or kids...Well worth seeing and a great meeting place!",
          "We went here and looking to emulate the photos we saw online but soon realized the water isn't fuctioning during the winter months. So no illusion.",
          "I can categorically state that this feature does not work in the winter. It is not switched on until the middle of April. This information comes from the tourist information centre.",
          "We came here in late May and it was around 90 degrees F in Bordeaux. Both locals and tourists were playing in the water during the day and into the night, but this didn't detract from the picturesque view. It was wonderful to see it as a spot that brought so many people",
          "It is absolutely stunning. The photo opportunities are endless. The whole family loved it. It is quite a special place.",
          "No water or must during our visit ....must be closed during the winter months but would love to see it if we return to Bordeaux during the summer months",
          "The water mirror produced beautiful effects through steam and reflection. It was particularly beauiful at night",
          "Rain is not always a bad thing! Great view, great architecture, you can't miss it in your visit in Bordeaux (hard to miss anyway :-))",
          "This was a must see on our trip and we were not disappointed. Beautiful views and architecture! Not very busy or touristy, absolutely breathtaking.",
          "Like a lot of things in winter in Bordeaux, its `shut`. In other words there's no water to produce a mirror. However, still a fantastic view of the building opposite",
          "The water mirror of Bordeaux is a great view while wandering through the broad main streets, giving a truly impression of what was the city in the old days.",
          "I was lucky enough to be staying near the Water Mirror, so could take photos almost every time of the day. Watching the children ride their bicycles through the water was fun. Made me wish i had a better camera!",
          "This is a very well known attraction, and unusual! It affords a great photo opportunity of the facing buildings being reflected in the water....if the conditions are right! Worth stopping at as you walk along the river.",
          "If u visit Bordeaux you must see the mirror d eau because it is a very beautiful place. It is stunning expecially in the evening.",
          "During the 2nd day at Bordeaux I just walking around the city. The Water Mirror is a place that you have to visit, but without water on the mirror the water sensation (ilusion) is not so good. Enjoy the rest of the view. It's really stunning.",
          "Having a wander around Bordeaux and we headed for Le Miroir d\u2019eau, a stones throw from Place de la Bourse. The weather was sweltering and I couldn\u2019t resist joining all the people playing in the water. Took my shoes off and the water was delightfully cool. Had a slow walk along",
          "No water no mirror! It sounds like a great idea but, like a light switch, it's either on or off. Off, as now, it's a concrete platform. Or nothing.",
          "Its one of the iconic sights of Bordeaux. It's really impressive but the lights and reflections looks amazing at night.",
          "We stopped at Bordeaux on a cruise from Southampton. The ship was small enough to moor right along the quayside not far from the Water Mirror. The way they have re-modelled the quayside is lovely and the Water Margin is amazing. It must take some skill to get such a large area",
          "Passed through on my way to dinner. I have to say it was nice. If your in the area its worth a look.",
          "When we reached the Water Mirror there was no water so we walked around and suddenly noticed that it was filling up again - Bordeaux having its little joke we thought. Anyway it filled up and the effect was magical everything was in the mirror. Lovely",
          "Was very excited to see this landmark but was quite disappointed. Unfortunately it was covered in children so photos were ruined, and it is not mirrored like advertised.",
          "If the weather isn't to windy or wet then a visit in both day and night is worth it if just for the photo op. The pool empties and refills quite regularly with a large mist cloud building when it refills. You'll spend longer than you think trying to time the shot with the metro",
          "If you are in Bordeaux, you have to make a visit to see the Water Mirror, hopefully on a sunny day. I have great pictures of my partner wading in the water with the Place Royale in the background.",
          "Great reflection of the Borse across the street, and sometimes it looked like steam was coming out. This was just lots of fun and another credit to Bordeaux.",
          "It was a cool n calm evening. the water reflection was perfect. a great place for pictures n walk. Beautiful.",
          "It is quite interesting, cools you off on a hot day like name says it is a water mirror now I have 2 more Characters to write",
          "Love to watch people here, there are different stages of the water system - Mist, a layer of water about an inch deep, then the wet reflective surface. It\u2019s not just the kids that like to play in the water! Try to go early in the day or late at night if you want a photo without",
          "We visited The Water Mirror in September during sunset. Definitely worth a visit when the sun goes down, the lights reflecting off the water looks magical. A perfect photo opportunity.",
          "Well worth a walk to see this. It\u2019s next the river and would be wonderful on a still evening with next to no wind.",
          "Freezy December visit, the mirror was off. There was still a little bit of dampness to reflect the Bourse so not a totally useless photo opportunity.",
          "Fun place, and very welcome on a hot day in Southern France! Of course also a nice break if you're traveling with kids.",
          "As I said in my review of the Place de la Bourse, this is a MUST see. It changes every time you look at it! Magnificent!",
          "It just shows how simple things can be so beautiful. Definitely worth visiting at night to take a few snaps.",
          "Having seen some photographs taken at night reflecting the lights in the pool, it was disappointing to find that the water is drained at 6:30 p.m. so night shots were not possible.",
          "This unique spot has been projected specifically to allow good photos with reflection of the palace on the waters of the fountain, a nice idea to valorize and make precious for a general public this nice palace facing the river",
          "A perfect location for a late afternoon stroll to take in the grandeur of the city and observe the locals and visitors. Highly recommended.",
          "This is a must see but you have to go at different times of the day. It is beautiful during the day and at night. Bordeaux is definitely a city that warrants at least one overnight to fully appreciate its beauty.",
          "Fortunately we took a walking tour through the Tourist Office and our guide Anne was really knowledgeable and nice She explained how the water drains every twenty minutes to be purified, that while the water is in motion you won't get the best photo. Also how the architect made",
          "The water mirror is creatively designed to fully reflected the grand palace in Bordeaux. After your dinner in any adjacent restaurant, take a walk along Garonne and enjoy the beautiful picture perfect view. This is one of the signature night view in Bordeaux."

          "Another iconic monument of the city of Bordeaux. Definitely the right choice to visit on a hot day \ud83d\ude00 as the mist did cool us down. A fantastic backdrop of buildings and prime spot to get cool pictures. It can get busy and the mist is generated roughly every 15 minutes.",
          "We must have hit an off day. Maybe this shallow pool does its tricks on nicer days than the rainy day we were there (you can't select the weather you have when you visit), but we saw nothing special. We waited for a while to see if it would \u2026",

          "Amazing reflections from the pool. The water and vanishes and refills to create spectacular water formations. Only disappointment for me was that the day we went, it was I little overcast, I imagine in the sun it would have been even better.",
          "Before I visited. I thought this would be a bit gimmicky, but it's a great space well worth visiting. The mirror filling up reminded me of a scene in ghostbusters 2, but that's not really relevant!\nOur 1 year old loved playing in the water, \u2026",
          "Loved it here. The fountain (it's not really a fountain) fills with 2cm of water and becomes a vast mirror. Great for photos. On the hour it drains itself and then a spray is emitted for about 5 mins. In summer this would be brilliant for \u2026",
          "A superb place to be during a hot summer.\nThe fountain cycles between modes and it takes some time to experience them all.\nIt is super fun for kids. We'll worth a visit if you are in the vicinity.",
          "Beautiful place where you can enyoy yourself with your naughty little ones. It's beautiful, it's fun and you can walk and move like a fish in the water. The views of the riverside are also a wonderful experience. I recommend you its visit.",
          "Awesome place to visit,in hot days also helps you because periodically small amount of water is spraying from this water-mirror.",
          "Beautiful landmark! Really is like a large mirror, the reflections of the architecture looks amazing and warm colours when the sun sets",
          "Beautiful location to snap that perfect picture - in theory. Reality: a ton of people there and people seeking refreshment by walking through it. \nDespite all that, the view is stunning and still warrants lovely pictures.",
          "Too beautiful! A must go if you are in Bordeaux. Wait for the water to rise, and the steam! So surreal!",
          "We were there in a heatwave - so many people we paddling in the water to cool off. That meant we didn't get the wonderful reflection view. But it's a well maintained river front area -  thank you Bordeaux.",
          "Our kids had a great time here.  We stayed from afternoon till evening. So many options of eating out nearby.  A sunny day adds too the feel good factor.  Supermarkets are also closely located in case you need some baby related urgent things.  Lovely wine and dine places around.",
          "A lovely scenic spot down by the river. Probably best viewed in the morning to see the view lit up, though it looks lovely across the river at sunset.",
          "Really cool and get some really artistic photos here during the day and night. It's free and gorgeous. Several street performers come here at night.",
          "Fun concept, our 4 year old enjoyed playing in the fountain especially the mist part",
          "Bit anti climactic but still very cool. Good luck getting all the goons off it for people to take a nice photo",
          "Is beautiful you can see the reflection of the building in the water so good",
          "Cool feature easily missed.  At least I missed it until I went searching for it.  It's the large elevated plaza across the street from the Place de la Bourse along the waterfront.  They put a shallow layer of water on the surface to form the mirror, making it quite easy for one to look like they're walking on water.",
          "Wonderful idea. Great to see everyone having fun and cooling off the hottest day on record.",
          "Mirror effect of Place de la Bourse is also a really nice attraction in Bordeaux and it have a really nice reflection. Its great",
          "Awesome to take pics of, but strangely enough looks way better in pictures, through camera lenses than through the human eye :)",
          "Great for the kids to run around in, planned to spend an afternoon there, but all done after 30 minutes.. kids loved it though!",
          "Lovely place to visit with little ones who can paddle on a warm day. For best photos of the reflection take them in the evening when all the lights reflect.",
          "Lovely place. We did not see it during the night but the view is stunning. In a very hot day Le Miroir d'eau can save lives :). Kids feel over the moon here!",
          "Shut down for maintenance this winter. Of course when i'm somwehere....",
          "It's fun. Might get better photos at night",
          "I can imagine that it can be beautifull.....if no-one is there! In summer there are loads of people walking en playing in the waters. So the hole mirror effect is gone. But still a beautifull square and buildings.",
          "Beautiful, a must see! There is always something going on^^",
          "Nice and big. Not just tourist attraction but actually nice to see. Also the boulevard.",
          "I just love these design pieces in historic city centers. This is one of my favourites - it is both stylish and useful in hot days that are more than often in west of France. Loved it here!",
          "It,s simple, but have something magic. Better visit it at night",
          "A fun place to visit if in the area. Great to see the kids having fun in the spray on a hot day.",
          "Love it.  Go when there is water for the reflection.  Around 10 a.m. would be good, fewer people.  Beautiful reflection of the whole concourse.",
          "Was on the bus trip, this water feature was crowded with people enjoying the sprinkler system do mo reflection today.  Bud a great way to get a potted history of the city",
          "What can I write about Bordeaux? For sure it is one of the most beautiful cities in France. And Le Miroir d'eau is great place to make beautiful photos and memories from it ! Around it lot of people coming to have a lunch, sit, talk, jog, play music etc... For sure it is worth to see",
          "Beautiful attraction of mirrored water but was full of paddlers the first time so we tried to go back late evening and early morning and it was dry both times. Possibly only works during the main part of the day?!",
          "Nice place but really crowded at this time of the year. Consider going very early morning g or late evening",
          "I love the view. Tranquil gardens to wander through and the centre for lunch or dinner is a stone's throw. Beautiful place for a break.",
          "Not what I expected but beautifully and simply well done. If you're going to see this with your children on a hot day then take spare clothes for the kids and let them splash and have fun.",
          "A wonderful place to take toddlers and so beautiful it's quite breathtaking. Think of it as a very upmarket version of Granary Square in Kings Cross London",
          "Bordeaux! Though it was very hot, it was fun to see kids and adults play while cooling down from the heat on the 'Le Miror d'eau'. A city that cares for it's people - locals and visitors is my kinda place. I like it a LOT here \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Great place to hangout with your loved one's. Very chillout sit and have a glass of wine and unwind.",
          "A great place to cool down your feet on a hot day!  I enjoyed out a lot!",
          "A beautiful social space with wonderful views and a great vibe of a special city",
          "Es muy bonito!\nIt\u2019s nice, water is not really cold you can get in!",
          "Lots of activities to enjoy on the promenade but very busy. Impossible to take the famous photo at this time of year because this location is extremely popular, but well worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful water mirror on a bright and sunny day, not too busy",
          "Great fun for kids.  Definitely need a change of clothes ready as although the water was shallow most of the kids were rolling around in the water and kicking water over everyone.",
          "Great idea \ud83d\udc4d just catch up a bit!)",
          "A very nice, public fountain. Used vor refreshment, but also as a meeting point for bands and other artists.",
          "Lovely atmosphere with everyone relaxing here during the hot weather. The view of the buildings was spectacular",
          "Kids loved it though they did slip twice so watch out.",
          "Really cool shallow strip of water that the local can walk in etc to cool down really nice to see",
          "A great place to cool down your feet on a hot summer day! Good atmosphere and view...",
          "Great place to have fun in hot sunny days. A great idea.",
          "kids will spend time during the summer time but adults may enjoy too",
          "A simple application but impressive at night having reflection on Bourse via water. In the morning it is like a water play ground especially for children.",
          "Lovely place. Very nice view of Place de la Bourse and the river.",
          "A social gathering point.,street entertainment with stunning views mixed both cool mists spraying in the heat.",
          "Amazing place both in Daytime(summertime an sunny for the best results) and Especially at Night, where the lighting is Off the chart! !!",
          "People playing around in the sun & water all day, this is fun! Must visit if you're in Bordeaux.",
          "Fantastic place. Enjoyed very much.",
          "My favorite place in all the city \u2665\ufe0f",
          "I really loved, very good to relax",
          "Bourdeau is a fantastic place to holiday in. Food and wine are a delight, and it's far enough South to be just a days travel from the ferry terminals on the channel coast.",
          "Nice fountain to visit and cool off your feet in  the summer.",
          "Worth a visit - spare yourself 20 mins to sit and watch it change. Delightful. Kids love it.",
          "Simple and beautiful place to have fun and enjoy a great view.",
          "The mirror is situated along a vast Riverside boardwalk in Bordeaux so can be very quiet and difficult to get an iconic reflection shots without a ton of people in it.  Go late or early.  Be mindful of Saturday Guillet Jaunes protests that \u2026",
          "Every angle gives you new insight.  Especially fun if there are small children about. ,)",
          "Really good idea, and Dutch a nice place to go during summer",
          "This place looks stunning day and night. Different vibes at day, different vibes at night, loads of fun, you can take awesome photos and simply enjoy walking on water \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Refreshing and beautifully placed (just across the Palais de la bourse)...it was a must during the heatwaves of this summer.",
          "It's ok. Lots of people and kids enjoying the water fountains.",
          "Just a place people gather at for no particular reason. Nice spot if you love crowds.",
          "Great photographic location,  unless the council are digging bits up!",
          "Amazing place. Very unique. Water reflow is every 20 mins. It creates a sort of mist, really amazing.",
          "Nothing special reallly but lots of kids were having fun splashing around! :)",
          "Spectacular? Possibly. But because this is France, folk wander across the water mirage so the reflection is impossible to spot and there's literally nothing to see",
          "An amazing funny place where you can keep dancing with water",
          "Lucky enough to see this in autumn \ud83c\udf42",
          "Lovely spray of water for children to cool down during the summer heat",

          "Children and adults both having a lot of fun there in summer.",
          "This place is rocking with great places to eat and check out the old buildings. Great city to walk.",
          "You have just got to do it to appreciate it.",
          "It's an interesting area and on a nice day you can make nice photos, especially when the square switches between the mirror and the fog mode",
          "Nearly midnight on a lovely warm evening.\nEveryone splashing around in the Miroir d' way, (which is basically a large puddle)",
          "Very very Nice. The kids loved IT!",
          "Good to watch. But you can't see the mirror effect cos the pond is full of kids and their parents \ud83d\ude03",
          "Only thing to say really is it's pretty cool",
          "It's only on out of winter. But it's really beautiful. Wait for it to make the fog... Hehehe",
          "Absolutely loved this. The reflection, and therefore the view, changes with the light and the sky making for some stunning images.\nIn summer it emits a fine water mist every 15 minutes which makes for a completely different scene.\nThe only \u2026",
          "It is an iconic place in Bordeaux for a good reason.",
          "Nice place with animation and plenty of photo opportunities. Not to be missed.",
          "Lovely place to just sit and watch the river flow by.",
          "It was fun! There are different levels of water and then there is some steam, and it's great on a nice day, especially for families with kids. There were children playing, people jogging through it... It was sweet. I wasn't sure of what it \u2026",
          "Very beautiful at night. Spectacular view of the city and its surroundings. Lots of locals and tourists enjoying themselves. Makes for a romantic spot and perfect ending to a dinner date.",
          "Great place for kids to cool down on a hot day",
          "Very touristy but worth it! Ended up going eaaarly morning to get a picture without other people in it only to find out the water in front must turn on at a certain time. Nevertheless you can still get amazing photos.",
          "This place is awesome! I really like the fog effect that they made every several minutes, and the reflection of Place de la Bourse in the water mirror. \nComing here in the night was the best idea! For tropical tourist who will be here at night: don't forget to bring jacket!",
          "One of the best place to visit!",
          "Windy so didn't get full \"mirror\" effect. Too many people walking across mirror to have their pictures taken",
          "Sad to say wanted to see mirror effect etc no water working Sad would have been great",
          "Love what Bordeaux has done with its waterfront! I remember when it was just full of old metal and garbage. What a difference and beautiful! Tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s jolie !",
          "It's probably one of the calling cards of the city. For me it was something new, first time I have seen such a solution - very creative and interesting. Recommended to experience especially evening and nighttime - lots of lights reflect (also cars and tramways) in the water.",
          "A perfect place to be, sat on the steps for several hours in the sun.",
          "Doen't work during December",
          "There is on the ground big  area where is 2cm water, you can see like a mirror as you see in the picture",
          "a charming and romantic place to visit",
          "Amazing site. I was there in the middle of the day and then at night when the lights turn on (21:30 summer time) and it was amazing. Kids can play on it with small amount of water and then they wash it all with lots of water and when this \u2026",
          "The water mirror is the real deal here. Truly amazing how humans can lose their minds with a water fountain. You will be able to run across the fountain getting wet among babies playing and people full dressed inside the water. It really puts things in perspective watching people enjoying the mere existence of a place with water",
          "Stunning and right along the river, must see in Bordeaux.",
          "Wonderful to see! Must see in bordeaux",
          "Magical. Kids heaven in hot times",

          "Enchanting place where you will return \ud83d\ude42",
          "Magnificent view of the city. Perfect place for a picnic",
          "Great place for a photo. Hang around as different experiences occur at this feature. It may look empty but will automatically fill if you hang around for 10mins. Mist will form which creates a great place to cool down with the opportunity \u2026",
          "Good fun for kids",
          "Great  views and water park on a hot day",
          "You need to be patient, otherwise you will miss it since it takes it's time",
          "Tourists must visit this place. Very beautiful.",
          "Great fun, very busy. Cycles through various stages and on a hot day the mist cycle is perfect. On the busier days don't expect much of a mirror sheen to the water surface due to everyone playing and running through it.",
          "Great place for a photo opportunity. 3 minutes to fill, 15 minutes of mirror effect, 5 minutes to drain, 3 minutes of fog effect.",
          "Good fun . People are drawn to it.",
          "I used the mirror to peer into my distant present. I was stunned by what I saw.",

          "Look a like a swimming pool great place for children",
          "Wonderful, a hit w the kids. Must see in Bordeaux.",
          "Cool place to hang out during summer in Bordeaux. Usually very crowded, because literally everybody else is doing the same. There is nothing close there in terms of groceries or food trucks or anything, so you should bring a drink and snacks.",
          "Nice place to sit and get a great Panasonic view of the city by the river. It is besutiful. A must visit. At night it's even more beautiful. The water Infront is dried up right now. You'll find alot of people with their skateboards or soaking the sun in the promenade area.",
          "I can see the potential for this to be beautiful, however people are constantly walking across, with kids splashing every second, the reflection is impossible to capture...",
          "Mirror mirror on the floor?...great to see the kids just playing with the water.",
          "nice experience. must see",
          "Interesting different.... On a nice evening",
          "Awesome idea, although in warm weather you will never see the reflection sure to the large amount of people walking, running and lying in the fountain. Still, a must see in a great location on the riverfront walk.",
          "Great if you go with kids",
          "Absolutely beautiful, I love Bordeaux.",
          "Not always able to get that great photo.",
          "Absolutely recommend! You can\u2019t leave Bordeaux without go there!",
          "Photographers, prepare to have a field day at this spot. The architecture is perfectly designed so the fountain front reflects the beautiful architecture behind.\n\nFor the everyday person not in the arts, it\u2019s an absolutely beautiful place to walk along the river, while also enjoying street performers and a generally warm crowd.",
          "Beautiful especially at night\nI recommend going late, when most have gone home, so that you can enjoy this in all of it's glory and without distraction. By late I probably mean closer to midnight, if you wait until 2am many of the lights \u2026",
          "Cool! Children and adults used to play on the water.",
          "Stunningly beutiful and great for a paddle!",
          "Well its nice but why people take the same picture ?",
          "It\u2019s not quite what the photos make it but it\u2019s a brilliant play area for kids and a nice break from the city streets.",
          "It is closed in winters. Better to visite in summer to enjoy le miroir d'eau.",
          "A vibrant and fun place to visit when in Bordeaux.",
          "Stay for the full half hour to see the different stages.",
          "Put this on your must do list when visiting Bordeaux on a sunny day!",
          "Very nice to splash around on a hot day",
          "Definitely a must visit. Bring a camera.",
          "Lovely but very busy on a Weekend",
          "Nice spot to see especially at the summer night time",
          "Thier really is something quite childlike about  playing around in water. This is  something quite unusal, it's called water mirror in English. It's a large polished granite stone area that begins to mist with water spray. This quickly \u2026",
          "Great fountain in a great location. Highly recommended in summer.",
          "Amazing place",
          "Water spray every 20 minutes in the summer.",
          "Top top top !!",
          "It's so beautiful",
          "It\u2019s very beautiful to see the reflection on the water. To fully appreciate it you have to arrive early in the morning when the sun lights up the buildings and there is not many people to disturb the water.",
          "Nice place for kids during summer. It has magical look when the steam is sprayed!! And free!",
          "Simple ideas make wonders, great execution.",
          "Beautiful place but the attraction wasn\u2019t working.",
          "Nice place for the hot weather with children",
          "A great place to visit on the banks of the Garonne. Kids play there and people gather. Great reflexion of the surrounding buildings. I recommend it highly.",
          "A pleasent place on a sunny day, wide and clran",
          "World class installation never disappoints",
          "If you're in downtown Bordeaux, you must take a walk along the river and see the Mirror. Get out your selfie stick or bug a stranger and get a touristy photo taken. Absolutely beautiful. Surrounding gardens make it great for a picnic, so grab some baguettes or what have you and head on over!",
          "It just magical",
          "Maybe because it is January, or because it was raining... But it was closed. Just an extension of the big square",
          "It is an interesting installation, best viewed at night or evening. Fun for the kids though.",
          "Great place to snap mirror pictures for buildings across. Good place to hangout with people, relax and enjoy cool breeze along the river bank.",
          "Nice..worth visit",

          "Very busy spot. Nice for quick photos. Go early to avoid crowd",
          "I like it a lot bc it was so funny to see all the kids playing and being happy only with some water in the floor. It's so nice waking thought there at night.",
          "Great place to see",
          "Very cool public space! I wish more public spaces had installations like this.",
          "Very nice with water reflection.",

          "a must see of the city !! if you're lucky and there is no wind you can take the most beautiful photos of the reflection of the water",
          "Good place to relax and sit down.",
          "Mirror mirror!  great to see.",
          "Fun for the whole family.",
          "Wonderful place to spend some free time. It looks stunning all day long, however, the most beautiful time to see it is when it's getting dark. It becomes magical!",
          "Spectacular place to take a picture with Bordeaux reflected in the water.  My suggestion is to visit it at night in order to appreciate the lights of the city reflected in the Miroir!",
          "Beautiful square  , lovely city.",
          "Beautiful place to visit in Bordeaux",
          "Very beautiful!",
          "Beautiful setting at sunset",
          "Very picturesque place. You can't actually take great photos though in my opinion because a lot of people (kids) are playing in/on the water. It's nice to spend some time there especially for families.",
          "This is the world largest reflecting pool: the effect of water mirroring the buildings of the adjacent square is simply beautiful and gives its best at night. The pool is filled and emptied at regular intervals and I was told that during \u2026",
          "A fantastic centre piece.\nBordeaux is a truly beautiful city.\nThis is a must especially as it is at a junction with trams and river busses",

          "Very busy but spectacular, come in the evening for the best mirror views, the later the better as the crowds get smaller!!",

          "Amazing view at night",
          "Should be renamed 'Kiddies paddling pool'. You'd have more chance of winning the lotto than get decent pics of the reflections in le miroir due to hordes of kids running and paddling in the water and adults posing for pictures in the middle of it. Disappointing.",
          "My kid really enjoyed it a lot!",
          "Loved this place! If you are in Bordeaux this is must watch place. In the night with all the street lights and reflection of the building water in front is an amazing view.",
          "During the day this place is overcrowded. People lay down, run, even drink from this fountain! But after 21:00-22:00 here is so quiet place to have datings or night walks.",
          "Love this place and always come and visit each time we are in Bordeaux. Always fun to see people having fun there!",
          "A MUST see if you are in Bordeaux, the mirror effect is amazing! i would say it would have to be a still night for good photos but even still it is a great spot to take in the view of the palace!",
          "It was fun and refreshing being there",
          "Cool",
          "Very very hot when we were there, but the city is magical,  walking across the water fetures on the river side is the plc to be seen",
          "It's very nice place, occup it's better if tou go there in the morning before afternoon. It s good time for taking photo there",
          "Great family afternoon.",

          "Great photo location",
          "Awesome place for kids to play in the summer and for the adults to enjoy a walk along the river promenade. Although, I did appreciate walking bare feet through the cool water on a hot summer day.",

          "Best part of this museum we thought was the area about slavery and the sugar plantations- and of course France was a colonialist country like the UK. Also had a good roman exhibit. spent about an hour and a half here. Thought it was a bit lacking in WW2 history but then",

          "This is a hidden gem that does not get the recognition it deserves. It is probably overshadowed by the wine culture here, but this is an expertly done museum. An easily navigated walk through time with many excellent articles to view. We were really surprised at this 5 eruro",
          "This is a fabulous museum to learn about the city of Bordeaux, the areas around, its history and what created the wealth of Bordeaux. From the fascinating Neolithic/stone age/bronze age periods, right through to the Romans and present day. Also a moving exhibit of Bordeaux",
          "An excellent museum with the history of Aquitaine dating from the prehistoric era up to date. Absolutely fascinating with well laid out floor plans and so much to see you could spend a whole day there. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum is halfway through a refit, which is being done well. It starts off with bones and pots, but arranged so you don't get discouraged by being confronted with serried ranks of glass cases. It then spreads out to cover every aspect of local life and history, and there are",
          "To be honest we expected a bit more from a regional museum, especially with regard to more recent times - there was barely a mention of World War Two for example. What we did like was the walk through history presentation of the galleries, and the slavery section was well done.",

          "Permanent exhibits range from locally found Cro-Magnan objects to Roman sculptures and modern day French displays. I found the photos and actual chains of this country's relatively minor involvement in the African slave trade (11 - 13 million slaves until 1867) particularly",

          "Spent longer than expected here. Set up as a time line from prehistoric to modern. Attractive and informative displays. We were content to read the information but you can get the electronic handset. Lockers for hand bags once past security. We used our city metro pas for this",

          "This museum is in a very impressive building and takes you through the ages from Pre-historic to Roman to the start of Bordeaux wine trading across the Atlantic etc. It is very detailed, nicely laid out and has some beautiful pieces. Apart from the opportunity to do a cave",
          "We went to see the reproduction of the cave paintings from Lascaux and found so much more! We only had a short time but wished we could have stayed for a couple of hours more. Of interest was the comparison chart of prehistoric man. The explanations are only available in",
          "Came in on a Sunday afternoon. Loved the prehistoric section and roman remains. The medieval window is a real showstopper. The shipping and slave trade section is the sort of thing Bristol doesn't do as well. A very good local museum which is proud of its place in history",
          "We spent a few hours in this museum which is very interesting if a little repetitive. The main exhibition follows the history of the Aquitaine region from prehistoric times through to the modern day and there are some very interesting artefacts. It would not be somewhere for",

          "we showed up at 5 PM on a hot Sunday afternoon expecting this museum to be closed but in fact it was open until 6 PM. We decided to give it a go. Fortunately, I have a pretty good photographic memory so I can enjoy things twice; once watching it and once remembering that I",
          "One forgets how vitally important this part of France was to the Romans and the rest of Europe. This museum gives you a true sense of the trade that made it such a rich area, and how it was really a diverse and bustling center of Europe",
          "A good medium-sized museum. Enough from different periods to keep all interested, from pre-history neolithic pieces, to modern times. There is a particularly good, extensive and unflinching history of Bordeaux's involvement in the slave trade. These parts are helpfully presented",
          "The up-side: an honest facing-up to Bordeaux' role in the slave trade. The down-side: a failure to provide adequate access for people with mobility problems. And even the new displays have a faintly dated feel to them. Interesting rather than stunning.",
          "The Acquitaine museum is dedicated to the history of the town and region. Spread over two floors, it covers all parts of human history, from neolithic artifacts and pottery, to Roman carvings, to Medieval seamanship, through to modern times. With a good flow, and nice exhibits,",
          "The museum is well set out with clear and well-illuminated displays. Information in English would add to the visitor's experience and the museum directors should realise that not everyone speaks French.",

          "It always surprises me when big museums like that provide information of the exhibits only in one language. Is it only for French people, or how hard is it to print a few labels in English? Other than that it seemed like a good museum, shame that I don't know what I was seeing",

          "A very comprehensive museum covering the stone age up until the 1930's telling the history of Bordeaux and it's surrounding region. This must rank as one of the best museums I have been to. It was well laid out and easy to get around. I particularly liked the models of the ships",
          "We stopped here on an impulse as I am a mediaeval fan and who could miss Eleanor of Aquitane? We were on a short visit so didn't get to see too much but it did look like a good history of the area.",
          "I was expecting a so-so experience since the reviews in the guidebooks weren't too enthusiastic. As it turned out, the place was brilliantly put together and wonderfully educational. I spent three hours wandering through the exhibits and only fatigue and hunger prevented me",

          "I have visited many city history museums out of a sense of duty, but this time, it paid off. The Musee d'Aquitaine was delightful--not a snore or a bore. By using imaginative displays of mixed media, it illustrates the history, archeology and ethnology of the region from",

          "We enjoyed this interesting museum, it gives a very good insight into the history of the region without being too highbrow. Not too big with some great exhibits, apart from the ground floor of course, which has no translation at all, obviously only of interest to the French?",
          "A great museum, and a real oasis on a hot day! I was amazed at the volume of artefacts on show and the space in which to enjoy them. Well worth a visit, even on a short trip to the city.",
          "Incredibly detailed and informative, spanning two thousand years of history. Well laid out, plenty of places to repose & reflect",
          "From Paleolithic caves drawings and sculptures, to neolithic settlements and engravings, through Roman and Plantagenet times, Aquitaine has always been at the heart of history. This gives you an idea of how much this was the case, all the way to Montesquieu. And the marble",

          "There was a real range at this museum, looking at everything from prehistoric times through to Bordeaux in the C20th. Yes, downstairs the exhibits are only in French, but you can still marvel at the age, intricacy and beauty of the artefacts and figure out what they are and when",
          "Bordeaux has several interesting museums. This one has much of the geological and social history of the region. It was thoughtfully designed and interesting. Expect to spend at least 90 minutes here. It's well-worth the visit.",
          "This museum used to be free admission for the permanent exhibits. We visited in August 2014 and paid E4,00 each to enter. Not an issue. Only problem is that all labels are in French. This is ok except we were not informed before we paid and entered. Nice building though.",
          "Some great artefacts, particularly in the Gallo-roman section. All presented very well, both sensitively and tastefully. A plus would be how close you can get to many of the artefacts; a minus might be the lack of dual translations but it is their regional museum! Some",
          "Downstairs the Roman and palaeontology sections were very much in French and offered little to non-franco speaking visitors - which was such a huge shame considering some of the artefacts in the museum! Upstairs was a lot better with English and Spanish translations for MOST",

          "Nice looking displays and free admission. But, all labels for all exhibits are ONLY in French. There was one exhibit on early iron making with both French and English, but that label must have come from another museum as it is so out of place. Almost worthless for the non",
          "Very well designed layout to take you through the rich history of Bordeaux, its links to the romans, its importance in medieval times and the key to its wealth - wine and slavery. It could do with more explanations in other languages than French",
          "First of all , like almost all the museums, it is free. One still has to acquire a ticket at the entrance, but free. Nice Locker area for bags, etc. The museum is dedicated to the Aquitaine area and is organised in a manner that takes one from the earliest time man was here",
          "I really enjoyed the musee, especially with free admission to the main galleries, which was plenty for us. I was very impressed by the expanse of history covered, from prehistory with recreation of the Lascaux caves, to a substantial depiction of Roman and medieval times through",
          "We stopped to look at this museum. It showed a lot of Bordeaux history, A little too much ancient statues and empty spaces for our tastes. It kind of rambles along.",
          "Bordeaux is a great city with an rich and interesting history. The Musee d'Aquitane makes this history come alive in a creative and engaging fashion. Today, Bordeaux is so closely associated with the wine trade that one tends to forget other chapters of its history -- although",
          "Easy to get to, free entry and well laid out exhibits. It tells the story of a fabulous city in a very engaging way. It is a small collection that can be seen and appreciated in about an hour. Work is still ongoing with the 20th century part of the story. After a river",
          "Attractive and well laid out but not enough exhibits to follow the regional history easily. All explanations in French only so thankfully we had an English speaking guide.",

          "We are museum geeks so it was a little disappointing to visit this museum's first floor where so little interpretation was offered. The second floor, with more recent permanent exhibitions, was much better. Given the amazing history of this region, one hopes only that more will",

          "There wasn\u2019t much English information in the museum except in the slavery section which was very good.

          "I only visited the permanent exhibition, which is the standard history of the area from prehistoric to modern times. There is a lot of very good Roman material. All panels and labels are in French only until the very last few rooms when some are also in English and Spanish. To",
          "As municipal museums go, this is a pretty good one. Much effort went into most of the displays, which more or less present the history of Bordeaux from prehistoric times to the mid 20th century. A curious omission is the origin of medieval Bordeaux. With no mention of her",
          "The permanent (free) portion of the exhibit shows the history of the city and its evolution. The naval area is nice",
          "Alot of Roman mosaics and statues but the upper floor had a new exhibition of Bordeaux in the middle ages very intersting",
          "There was some temporary exhibits like one about Australian artists, and another one about Viet Nam photographies. The permanent exhibit is the best to understand the history of the South West of France, its architecture, its land, its way of living through time.",
          "I visited here with my 7 year old grandaughter and we both loved it . The museum is full of absolutely wonderful exhibits about the history and archeology of Aquitaine - which kept both of us engaged and interested , and it is exhibited in a way that makes it exciting for a",
          "This was a great museum (and free - can't beat the value). It was a good size - it took me about 2 hours to go through. It covers a wide range of Acquitaine grouped into several eras: 1) Stone Age; 2) Roman; 3) Middle Ages; 4) Golden Age of Bordeaux and Enlightenment. There",
          "Excellent , even though my french is minimal it was a great museum that explained the fascinating local history.",
          "We loved our recent visit to the Musee d'aquitaine, which does a great job showcasing the very long history of the Bordeaux region over the last 30,000 years through to the 18th century. The extensive collection of neolithic, Roman, medieval and other periods was quite",
          "We are history buffs so like such museums. This museum is free (except special exhibitions) and has strengths and weaknesses. The early and Roman exhibits were strong, as well as the 18th century boom times of Bordeaux during the sugar and slave trade. We were interested in the",
          "There's an awful lot to see here and if your French is limited its probably a good idea to skip through the prehistory and the Roman sections and head for the development of Bordeaux. This section does have info in English and there's plenty of audio/visual information which I ,",
          "We spent several hours enjoying the exhibits of early mankind in this region of France which is adjacent to the Dordogne with its cave paintings and archaeological sites. The museum has wonderful exhibits of early mankind, including tools, examples of campsites, weapons, photos",
          "A fascinating collection not visited often enough by tourists. Worth exploring, but devote at least a couple of hrs to do it justice. Enjoy!",
          "We were recommended to visit. There are very extensive and elaborate displays of Roman times and the slave trade. Sadly the early parts of the exhibition lack any English descriptions and our request for some information in English at reception was met by a blank stare",
          "Conveniently located in the city centre and with free entry, this is worth a visit even if you do not have time to see all of it. To decide what you might have time for, or what your main interests would be, go to the official site for the museum which has info on permanent and",

          "As something of a museum geek, I can attest to having seen far better museums elsewhere in Europe. I visited the Musee Aquitaine without spouse or kids on a Sunday afternoon in early September 2013. The entrance to the museum is rather uninviting, and so the management",
          "This museum has some interesting artefacts. It is laid out following a timeline. The roman mosaics are impressive and the upper floor with the model ships is interesting. There is an exhibition on slavery similar to the one in Liverpool's Maritime museum.",
          "It's not no much to see in Bordeaux, so this one is quite entertaining. The permanent collection shows the history of the region from early ages till recent times. I was impressed with the documents showing the facts of slavory - very sad and interesting to know. The collections",
          "Really excellent museum, and free, which shows local history right from prehistoric times onwards.lots of interesting artefacts and visual displays. Not very interactive so young children will likely get bored rather quickly but worth a visit nevertheless.",
          "Very kind and knowledgable staff. The expositions are great, probably there could be more variety but that was fine.",
          "The museum deals with a huge range of Aquitaines history. They deal with their history on slavery honestly and courageosly.",
          "Worth a visit as its free and is interesting in places. There are some very comfy chairs dotted around! It would have benefitted from some form of English translation - leaflet, headset etc. I would have even paid for it as it would have made the trip much more beneficial. But",

          "Full of beautiful pieces of ancient history found in the streets of Bordeaux! Lovely mosaics and stone work, and a great replica of the Grottes de Lascaux paintings, Also has videos of how man worked in prehistoric times. I loved it! And it's free!",
          "Free entry is a real bonus. Subsidies of such attractions make a country's heritage available to all who are interested. No Coke or coffee machines, no gift shops that we could see. How refreshing. The displays are well thought out and engage one as one travels through man's",

          "Very poor museum - no creativity in presentation. There was a \"special presentation\" about Cuba when we were there - just a room full of old, repetitive prints of Cuba from the 18th century with no English translation - terribly poor.",
          "Fascinating & detailed look at the history & archaeological discoveries of the Bordeaux region through the ages. It's well worth spending a couple of hours & it's free.",
          "Very large takes a couple of hours to go round, plenty Roman material. Lots of information about the last three centuries, nearly all in French was the only downside, but more English than some. I liked it.",
          "This is a stunning museum--and it is free! It is visually interesting, engrossing, and covers so much time and space in a well done format. Even if you do not read French, the walk-through alone is a trip through history. My wish is that we had not saved it for the last day so",

          "This is an impressive bell tower dating back to the 15th century. Interestingly the tower was not used for its intended purpose until late in the 18th century, as the church could not afford to get the bells they needed! So the tower was used for housing instead! Very inventive.",
          "Like many of similar \"tall structures\", it's a hike to get to the top. But the views are well worth it - especially given that most buildings in the city are limited to 6 stories so you are towering above them. With the Citypass it's excellent value.",
          "There are 233 steps before you can scale the summit. Children are free and it cost \u20ac6 per adult. The views from the top are breathtaking and you can go to two levels. Worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Another good little visit which is included in the Bordeaux city pass. Steep and narrow spiral stone stairwell with 200+ steps but the view at the top is worth the climb,",
          "Great views of Bordeaux and the Cathedral. Amazing panorama shots. Unfortunately there are metal wires stretched across the top as a safety measure, so there is abstracted view from the top balcony. However, still worth a visit. Very narrow staircase, limited access.",
          "A tower just next to the St. Andre Cathedral. Constructed between 1440 and 1500 at the initiative of the archbishop Pyy Berland. Interestingly it has been isolated from the rest of the cathedral to protect the church from the vibrations of the bells. We were unfortunate as it",
          "Built in the 1500's ...and 200 steps to the top...not for us. Narrow passage..we see people climbing up and others down. Perfect view from the top ..if you have the knees for it.",
          "There are over 200 steps to the top and the staircase is one way and very narrow. However the numbers are limited at any one time. The views are worth the climb so onwards and upwards!",
          "The view from the near the top is well worth the climb of over 230 steps of a narrow spiral stone staircase. Bit of a problem as at times visitors were climbing as others were descending.50 metres up you can walk around and there are small plaques telling you what you can see .",
          "Go when it is cool because there are over 200 steps to climb to get to the top for a great view of the city.",
          "Great views from the top. Lots of narrow stairs with few easy passing places when someone coming the other way is not slim! Be aware on 19 people allowed up at a time so prepare to wait in line.",
          "If you like climbing these types of towers in Europe, this will be no exception. Steep, stone steps spiral their way to two stops- one just below the top and the top itself. Not much room in the stair well to pass others so, if you are claustrophobic, you might wish to stay on",
          "An alternative location to get a great view of the city however it is quite a climb up to the tower with very narrow staircase. But once you made it, on a day with good weather you\u2019ll be rewarded.",
          "The views from the top of this tower are amazing. Only 19 people are allowed in the tower, so depending on how many people are already in there you may have to queue. There were about 9 people before me. The tower is visible from virtually any part of Bordeaux as the whole",
          "A great walk up this imposing building. Really worth the view at the top. 233 steps up get there early as they only allow a few numbers up at a time as so small. Worth the walk though.",
          "This is amazing and a must see in Bordeaux. The gold statute on top is very striking. You cannot avoid seeing it beside StAndre Cathedral",
          "Offers great views from the top of the tower and enough historic interest for those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t climb stairs. A must see while in town",

          "There is a charge to go up the Pey Berland Tower - 6 euros per person which affords you views of Bordeaux. Or, you can enjoy the great architecture of this building from the outside.",
          "If you are ok with stairs, then I'd highly recommend this, as the views of Bordeaux are worth the climb. There is no lift. Only a certain number of people are permitted up the tower at any one time, so you may have to wait for people to come down before you're allowed up.",
          "Really nice view from the top but climbing more then 200 steps in an almost claustrophobic staircase that has traffic going both up and down was definitely difficult. A number of people were really having problems. I was a bit worried both ways. Would recommend you seriously",

          "Looked great from the ground but the queue to climb to the top barely moved in half an hour. Disappointed to have to give up as I was advised the views from the top were well worth the climb. Got some nice pictures though.",
          "The Pey Berland tower is a belfry of the magnificent St. Andre Cathedral, built separately beside it, in order to spare the Cathedral of huge bells vibrations when ringing. We wanted to climb it for the views, but at 5.15 PM we were not admitted. Uninterested employee told us to",
          "240 steps later, we arrived at a magnificent view of the city. Really enjoyed this climb and would recommend.",
          "Pey-Berland Tower located on Place Pey-Berland and by the side of the Cathedral. Many people come to visit this place and queue up to climb 233 steps to the top to have nice views over the city. Entrance fee is required for the climb. It is considered worthwhile only sunny",
          "The 15th Century bell tower belonging to the adjacent Cathedral. Well worth the climb to the top for the city views (you have to squeee through a couple of quite narrow doorways). If there's a queue, maybe walk to La Fleche instead?",
          "Built in the 15th century, this bell tower was built away from the Cathedral it peals for to prevent threatening the integrity of the church. The tour is topped with a gilded statue of Madonna and child. The tower is open to the public to climb, 233 steps to the view terrace.",
          "Bell tower stands next to the cathedral, and has a separate entrance hence you pay 8 EUR to climb it and enjoy the view of the city. you may have to queue a bit, as there is a strict limit 19 at one go. There is only one stairway to go up and down so can be challenging. Don't",

          "Worth the climb, and also just the visit. Love the history of the place and how the bell tower had to be built separately to protect the cathedral fro the vibrations.",
          "Keep in mind that to get to the top, you need to climb a spiral staircase some 230 odd steps. If you suffer from fear of heights or from claustrophobia, do not attempt it. It's a to-way staircase, too! The view from the top is fantastic, and it's well going.",
          "For \u20ac6 you get some serious exercise and some fantastic views. There is some information about the church but you're probably only going to climb all the way up for that view. Which is worth it.",
          "Worth waiting in the queue (they allow 19 people up at one time). Bit of a climb to the top, but the views are lovely. Worth the inexpensive price. Only issue was as we climbed back down, there are people climbing up at the same time - in a tight spiral staircase.",
          "This is an excellent monument to visit when in Bordeaux. The vista from the top of the city is very impressive, but it is a strenuous climb for people who are not fit.",
          "Free for EU citizens who are 18-25 year old/ french nationals. Otherwise 5e charge. Only 19 people allowed up at one point. You have to walk up 233 steps",
          "If you are healthy and can climb, the views at the top of the tower are worth the effort. The stairs are steep and some older people might struggle with them.",
          "This was well worth the few Euros it cost to climb up the small spiral staircase and take in the views across the city.",
          "233 steps up a narrow and steep spiral staircase was surprisingly easy and the view from the two stages at the top was spectacular. The 6\u20ac admission price was definitely worth it.",
          "It is important to know that there is only one very tiddy stair. It is very tiring going up, but the view is nice!",
          "The stairs are very narrow and twisty and two skinny people would have trouble getting past each other. I'm not skinny and it's an uncomfortable climb and at the top, the doorway is built for medieval size people. If you're fat or overweight or broad, it's bearable but",
          "The best view of Bordeaux, definitely a must see when in Bordeaux, right before or after visiting the Cathedral. Very friendly staff to help waiting in line.",
          "Well worth a visit but beware, only 19 people allowed up at a time so go early to avoid a longish wait. 233 tiring stone spiral steps were narrow but good exercise!",
          "They only allow 19 people at a time so waiting in line is unavoidable. It is 6 euros per person and they accept credit cards as of July 15, 2017. It's definitely worth it to see panoramic views of Bordeaux that you can't get elsewhere. I'd recommend this if you are somewhat",
          "Climbed the tower today - be warned it is tight if you are meeting people the other way. 233 steps 40 metres high, but the view is fantastic and don't worry it's very safe up there you hate netted in! You can see for miles around and have great view down onto the cathedral.",
          "This is tight, twisty and tiring, folk passing up and down. They do limit numbers but not for the chunkier visitor perhaps. View from the top is worth it",
          "This beautiful bell tower is next to St Andrews Cathedral. The stairs to the viewing platforms are not for the faint hearted. There are 233 steps on this narrow stairwell. However, you get a 365 degree view of the city from on high and a great view of the Cathedral roof below.",
          "It was a pretty extreme experience climbing up. I'm in good shape, but this tower had everyone huffing. Once at the top it is very much worth it. There are 2 levels for viewing. The space is limited. The climb down is not as bad as going up, but do be careful, it's a tight",
          "Picture me - a middle-aged man, mildly claustrophobic, out of shape, high blood pressure, overweight and just having spent a sweaty but rewarding morning rambling around Bordeaux in temperatures into the high 30s. What would be the sensible thing to do next? Probably NOT to",
          "Really nice location, impressive tower. right next to the hotel de ville and Cathedral. Its a must see when in Bordeaux.",
          "233 spiral steps up 233 steps down but what a view of the city once you arrive a second balcony. Impressive even in the rain.",
          "You have to wait in the queue to enter to the tower but it's worth it (even 30 mins of waiting). Then you have to climb narrow stairs and it's alomst impossible to pass other people but then you can see the panoramic view that recompense you inconveniences.",
          "If you love climbing to see what is at the top then climb the bell tower. It gives you a great view over Bordeaux and particularly over the Cathedral. The stairs are narrower and get even narrower right at the top when you come outside again.",
          "The tower is a climb up narrow steps, which are uneven (so it is not for the faint of heart or anyone with back or knee problems). We went to the first landing, and there is a significant amount of information on what you are seeing; I went to the very top (which is roped to",
          "Quite a climb but well worth it when you see the panoramic 360 degree views from the top. Not for dodgy tickers or those suffering claustrophobia on the narrow spiral staircase.",
          "The signs do warn you of the 233 steps to the top of this tower. Those steps are a steep, narrow, spiral staircase with only a few niches for rest. Only 19 people are allowed in at a time, so the queue can be long at busy times. However, it is not 19 in and up, 19 down then",
          "Separate from the Cathedral which is something you see in Italy and not so much in France. I love Bordeaux and find it very beautiful but not so much from above, from this experience, or at least not from the viewpoint of the tower.",
          "Be warned - it's quite a climb to the top. There are views all over the city, although the city is quite flat so not a huge amount to see. Worth going if you're OK with the stairs. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait at all",
          "Having fun in Bordeaux has been hard work for us but this tower was good. Good view, interesting engineering, good stories. Max 19 people inside at once, you may have to wait. Loved the crypt, very spooky with nice video installation.",
          "This was a great way to see over the whole town. Many steps, of course. Easy to get to via walking or by the tram",
          "We queued a while, very busy but worth the wait, lovely to get to the top and see the views, stunning. You can stop half way and look around, cant remember how many steps but worth it. Allow an hour or so to climb and get back down. My kids 10 and 12 enjoyed.",
          "Yes it is quite an effort to get to the top - and passing is an intimate experience - but the view is certainly worth it. The powers that be have decreed that no more than 19 people may be inside at any one time - and the trip up/down needs around 20 minutes. So you can make the",
          "233 steps to the top but totally worth it. There are a couple of stops on the way to the top. You can see into the belfry and have a panoramic view at the top.",
          "Adult entry 5.50Euros. Great views over Bordeaux from the top. Having climbed many towers around the world, we would agree that there isn't a lot of room on the spiral staircase, but it's not as bad as some, and they do restrict entry numbers so that it isn't too crowded. If",
          "Tower of Pey-Berland. Amazing architecture. Historic spot and a perfect place to take a picture from Bordeaux.",
          "A very tall Bell Tower for a magnificent Cathedral. It is a beautiful structure. Apparently the reason the Bell Tower is separate from the church building is because of the thunder and the tremor created by the ringing of the bells which can be a dangerous threat to the safety",
          "When visiting the cathedral, this prominent structure stands out. We only took a short visit but they do have tours.",
          "Its 233 steps, very narrow, and no place to stop. People go up and down the same flight. Its an amazing view!!!",
          "231 steps up. But great views across the city. You can access for 'free' with your City Pass. They only allow 19 (yes an odd number) of people up the tower at a time. So you may want to consider a quieter time.",
          "At the tower, you don't get a great view without working for it - climb some 230 steps up! It is a narrow pathway up and one has to keep walking. There are small corners every now and then where one can rest for a bit (for the physically less fit, children or the elderly); on",
          "There will be a wait at the bottom of the tower to get in, due to limits on numbers (I waited a little over 10 minutes). The sign at the bottom warns you about the 231 steps you'll have to climb, but doesn't warn you about the petite and narrow doorway to get out onto the top",
          "5 euros gets you a steep climb to the top of the tower and a view of the city rooftops. All the important monuments and buildings are identified with a sign. Only 19 people are allowed up at any one time so there may be a short wait. Also it can be a bit of a squeeze on the",
          "It was rainy when we were at the Tower so we decided it wasn't a good idea to climb all the steps to the top. Even though we did not make it to the top of the tower we still enjoyed seeing the tower. It is massive and very imposing and you can see it from several different",
          "Climbing the many stairs worth it for views, each window looking out on different areas of the city just amazing",
          "Nice view for an ancient background. sadly, it was raining that time and the Cathedral was under renovation that's why we wasn't able to capture its full beauty.",
          "If you've got a good head for heights and a tolerance for a steep winding staircase, this is a fantastic visit for you! Climb the tower, counting the steps as you go, and you will be rewarded with fantastic 360\u00b0 views over the roof tops of the city of Bordeaux! The view on a",
          "The view from the top is very good. It's a shame the staff member was so unpleasant and insisted the four of us waiting outside waited in the rain even though the shop was empty and reproached us for sheltering under the porch entrance. It wasn't necessary.",
          "Great place for panoramic photos. The ticket is quite cheap and the trek up there will take about 7min if you're fairly fit. It's well worth the effort. go there",
          "We came around 4 pm on the first Sunday of the month when the entrance is free and there was a big queue to get in. The tower was closing at 5 pm but the person working there said that we would get inside. Around 4:20 he put the big sign at the end of the queue warning people",
          "It's 231 steps up the tower and only 19 people are allowed up at each time. Be sure to visit in the earlier opening hours when the queue isn't as long. After huffing and puffing up the stairs, your breath is taken away once again with the amazing view of the old city! Definitely",
          "I agree with other reviewers about the narrow, steep staircase but if you happen to go when it is not too busy it is well worth it. My husband and I went on a Wednesday morning in September and were able to walk up without anyone else walking up or down so we were lucky. Right",
          "By far the worst experience to date. Narrow steep staircase with no choice but hanging on to anything and anyone as people pass you to go up or down. This was scarey as all it takes is a small slip and you tumble down. Will not waste my money nor time on this.",
          "it's worth it. go in good weather only. located right in the city centre, accessible by tram, car, foot, bicycle. 5.50 euros for adults. children and elderly have discounted tariffs. some days may be free (need to check when)",
          "What a horrible experience. The organization of the place is minimal and I'm not sure what the point of making over 25 to pay. I understand the need to make money but why over 25s? The sign at the front said 19 people max inside which is reasonable but control of the flow should",
          "Quite a long wait as only 19 people at any time . Great view.. after climbing all the stairs alghough you can stop to catch your breath. Only \u20ac5,50 so worth it",
          "The tower was started in 1440 a short distance from Saint Andrew's Cathedral, but it did not get it's first bell until 1853. The 231 steps up the rounded takes you 50 meters (~150 feet) above the city for breath taking views of Saint Andrew's and the surrounding area. When you",
          "Nice view but one has to climb around 200 steps that are too small for 2 persons to climb in parallel. Buy the view from top is worth the climb.",
          "Firstly, if you are under 25 and from an EU country (must take some form of ID to prove it) this attraction is absolutely FREE! Therefore it simply is a must to do, right?! To add to that HUGE bonus, climbing these in excess of 200 steps gives you a wonderful, panoramic view of",
          "We were in gare st jean and start from there by walking and after 15 minutes we arrived to the tower. The tower is near st michel during the week was closed so we saw it from outside. There are cafe and markets around it",
          "I had the luxury of climbing the tower on a rainy day in mid-November, allowing me to be alone during the climb. I might not have liked it during a hot summer day with other tourists nipping at my heels, but it was a lovely experience to do at my leisure. The views were awesome,",
          "It's a pretty tower, but I missed some information about it. There is a huge golden statue on top, but information on who it is and why, is nowhere to be found. A missed opportunity!",
          "It is well worth the small fee to gain entrance to the towers steps Should be fit but well worth the climb on a fine day",
          "The view is beautiful from the tower. There are a lot of spiraling stairs but it is worth the effort.",
          "Very high up, the view is beautiful. But it's a very long stair walk up to the top to see the view of the church and city. It is good though",
          "The bell tower is separate from the nearby cathedral, separate due to anticipated vibrations long ago from the bell ringing. We climbed the 230-ish steps to the top for an amazing view of the city and rooftops and cathedral. We love to walk and climb, but there is no way to",
          "Mind the steps that are ...numerous and very very steep whilst the staircase is narrow. Yet once on top on the two platforms, what a magnificent view upon the city, just gorgeous: you can see the twonhall-Palais rohan-, the Palais de justice, the other churches of Bordeaux,",
          "More spiral stairs, 230+/- but worth the work to climb this magnificent land mark. Great views. went during the day and there was no line. Highest point in Bordeaux. Put it on the list of things to so.",
          "Worth the hard work to get to the top up the spiral staircase but wish it had been sunny. Last day in Bordeaux so no choice. Once at the top you can circle around and there are signs pointing at landmarks across the city. Still good for photo ops. Small gift shop at the",
          "Best view point for Bordeaux and what a stunning view it is! That said it's a very narrow staircase, if you meet anyone coming the other way, you'll have to breath in. It's also a spiral staircase so you can get dizzy pretty quickly, the steps are worn and uneven so good",
          "Amazing tower when you look it trough the Bordeaux skyline, it ads the charm to it. But up close it's located in a place not so touristic, and a couple of people looking a little bit sketchy, but that's just my impression. When looked at close its a nice attraction but it's not",
          "A large bell tower right in the centre of the city with over 230 steps going up in that spiral fashion it's a stiff climb my legs are still aching but the views from the top are spectacular. Well worth it if you're up to it. If not send a youngster up with a camera and admire",
          "A steep climb (233 steps) and very narrow - so not for the faint hearted or infirm. The views from the top are worth it - go on a day with good visibility and you can see for miles around. passing can be a bit tricky but well worth a visit.",
          "This bell tower is stunning viewed from almost any direction and having been cleaned relatively recently it fair shines in the sun. If you're up for it the climb is worth it (I think some 230 steps). Gets a little bit claustrophobic and humid but for those of you, like me, who",
          "The view from the tower is amazing! You have to climb quite a few stairs, but it is worth it! Mind, that the capacity of the tower is very limited (only 19 people in the same time). So it is smart to be there very early in the morning to be sure you will not be waiting to long.",
          "The views from the two look out points at the top of the tower are lovely and give you an idea of how big Bordeaux is. You can see for miles on a beautiful day and take in all the sights of the city from above - there are signs to show you where things are in the skyline. The",
          "Open on Sundays and on a bright day you get great 360-degree views over the city from 50 metres up. The stairs are tight, but that's the fun!",
          "Archbishop Pey (Pierre) Berland, an Anglophile, represented Bordeaux on its surrender to the French at the end of the Hundred Years' War in 1451. He started construction on the tower next to his Cathedral of St. Andre in 1440. Soil quality precluded building the heavy tower on",
          "If you like queueing for a while, and stair-climbing, and tourists, and jostling for prime photo-taking position. This is a must-see! Also, you can re-enact the scene from In Bruges if you're up for a laugh! I don't mean the one where Colm Meaney dies.",
          "Definitely worth the climb for the amazing views. Note that at busy times, you may have to wait as there are limits to the numbers that can go up at one time.",
          "It is just a tower but if you can handle a tight spiral staircase climb than the views of the city are the payoff.",
          "nothing special other than the amazing views over Bordeaux from the top. But the climb is an effort!",
          "Climbing over 200 steps in the heat is not for the faint-hearted or those not fond of small spaces (as you frequently need to stop on the way up or down to let people pass going the other way). But it does offer a good 360 degree view of Bordeaux so is worth the effort. Take",
          "This tower is next to eglise Saint Andr\u00e9. You have to clime more than 200 stairs to have a great view over Bordeaux. You might have to wait a bit before you can go in and start your clime. At 10 H, there were two groups in front in me, so we all had to wait, because they have",
          "Fun to walk to the top with the kids. Narrow staircase to top levels. Good to see views of the city.",
          "Arrived at exactly 2pm when the tower re- opened after lunch. No queue so we got straight in. The children set quite a fast climbing pace on the way up. Great views over the city from the two platforms. Passing people on the steps can be intricate or even imitate, may be",
          "Having less than two days to explore Bordeaux, we went around lunch time, but the tower was closed, love the building from the outside, wanted to see the panorama, hope they think about the visitors more, we only have few hours in a place. :(",
          "this is a must-do on your trip to Bordeaux - the views are spectacular! Be aware that it is quite a climb and that passing others on the narrow spiral staircase needs to be done carefully! Also there may be a short wait to gain access as there is a limit to numbers in the tower",
          "This is a steep, dark, circular staircase of 233 steps. Passing people going the other way is not easy and there is only one place for a breather. The exit is low and quite tight, especially on the upper level. Once at the top, the 360 view makes the effort worthwhile. This is",
          "Well I have vertigo but, I kept coming back to that place having to climb the medieval stairs to look at the view and I did. Climbing the steps was like climbing through history... I wasn't the first one to step on those and you could tell. ;) The view from the top allowed",
          "Most of the top things to do in Bordeaux are to see old buildings. Not a lot 'to do' once you get to them. At least at this tower, you could climb it and learn about how it was built about half-way up. 5 euros for adults; 3.50 euros for students.",
          "Whenever I see a tall tower built hundreds of years ago, I am impressed by the quality of engineering and construction. Fortunately, the tower is set in a large open area so you can stand back to admire it. Somehow, those responsible for the design understood that the soil",
          "Well worth the 224 steps up the spiral staircase to the top of this tower. The best views over the city of Bordeaux. Good explanations of the identified landmarks from the top.",
          "There are a lot of stairs to climb but the views from the top are worth it. The number of people allowed in at one time is limited but its not a long wait.",
          "Unfortunately on the day we had planned to visit the tower it was unexpectedly closed. The Tower of Pey-Berland is the bell tower for the adjacent Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Andr\u00e9 . It was built separately back in the mid-15th century to avoid vibrations from the bells to the church.",
          "I loved walking through the catacombs, but there isnt much to it so it may not be for everyone. Got there at 4:30 pm (16:30) on a Tuesday. There was about 100 people in line in front of us and it was a 35 minute wait. You have to descend about 200 steps to get down and then back",
          "It is mostly in Italay usual that the \"campanile\", the bell tower is separated from the church. It seems that it is also common in France, at least in Bordeaux. The Saint Michel basilica has got also a separeted bell-tower. If you are young ad fit, you can manage the 231 steps",
          "We were brave and climbed up the narrow staircase where we were treated to an unbelievable view of the city. The tower I'd part of the lovely St Andre Church. Worth a visit.",
          "Great views over Bordeaux and well worth the 220 step climb! It is quite narrow so watch your step but a good way of seeing Bordeaux from above.",
          "Worth all the steps, able to obtain great pictures for the top. The steps are twisting so be sure to have good shoes on your feet.",
          "The 231 stairs can be challenging to climb specially with the narrow spiral staircase. It can be quite hard at peak hours to deal with people going up and those coming down, there isn't much space for both hence the morning should be a better time to visit it. The visit is not",
          "This is one of the best things to do in Bordeaux, especially if you're not here for very long. If you are a student this attraction is free, so there's really no excuse! You can climb up to two levels, so tale a breather at the first level before making your final steps to the",
          "The tower availed us the view of the entire city and the Cathedral of Ste. Andrew. The church bell was of significant interest to me. There is a market on Sunday. Lots of fun for a 68 year old guy and his wife!",
          "would be good but big Que on a Sunday to get up as its restricted no of people allowed up . But the view would fantastic",
          "A wonderful structure in one of many throughout Bordeaux. If you are visiting Bordeaux it is a must to see this imposing yet separated bell tower of the Cathedral Saint Andr\u00e9.",
          "This is something you ought to do, especially on clear day. You have a wide view of central Bordeaux and a good view of the cathedral.",
          "While in Bordeaux this is a must see. The tower is adjacent to the Cathedral Saint-Andre, which is also worth a visit. Both are great examples of the Gothic style of architecture prevalent in 14 and 15th centuries in France. This tower was constructed after the Cathedral was",
          "The cathedral is very beautiful, there is also a nice little market on Sunday, restaurants and sometimes music, The tramway is right there for convenience. Driving is a little tricky as people tend to walk all over the place. be careful with bikes also.",
          "Bring your camera and walk up 231 steps see the city view. It was a an overcast day but still worth the the $5.50 euros. Cute store at the base where I purchased a nice tour book.",
          "This bell tower provides beautiful views over Bordeaux, but it is not the most spectacular lookout, due to simply the skyline of Bordeaux. Well worth the steps though, and definitely something that should be done at leats once. Cheap or free for students and young people.",
          "After being closed for a while due to a storm in Sept, the tower opened the day I was due to leave Bordeaux. I was determined to go up as I had read the views were amazing. 231 steps, up a old spiral staircase (keep in mind the people coming down use the staircase). I won't",
          "This is very easy to access, but you will have to climb 150+ steps in a narrow, spiral staircase to get to the top. Big rope to hang on to as you climb, so you just need to be patient. About 6 euro if i recall. Right beside the cathedral in Bordeaux, so great way to see the",
          "This is situated very close to the centre of Bordeaux (next to St Andre Cathedral). Lots of steps in traditional circular staircase but worth it for the view. Good to do early to reorientate yourself to Bordeaux.",
          "Tour Pey-Berland certainly offers a great view over the city, but you do have to earn it! It's fine for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness though (I'm six months pregnant and made it to the top fine), so don't let the thought of all those stairs put you off. It can be a",
          "I climbed it. Lots of steps, obviously. But the effort is part of the experience. Great views of Bordeax. Slightly overpriced in my view.",
          "Soooo many steps to climb, it's a lil overwhelming on the way down. The view on the top is amazing though",
          "I like this place so much ! 231 steps up and after : a beautiful view over the city (and even beyond if the weather is clear!)",
          "The climb up the tower through the winding spiral staircase can be a bit dizzying, but it is well worth the magnificent views. There are viewing platforms on two levels. Only 19 people are allowed in the tower at a given time to prevent traffic jams in the staircase. Since",
          "Its a fun walk up, dizzyness is more apparent then difficult. You might struggle if unfit. 2 stages to stop off, make sure you do the top one, easier to miss. The views are great on a good day, which most are. Not packed, very short queue, short wait. Good value, worth \u20ac5.50 in",
          "Nice vieuw, certainly worth to do the effort ! You need to be in good physical condition. Be there in time if you don't like queing.",
          "The 200 odd steps aren't bad at all and you're rewarded with lovely views of the city. We went in the middle of the day and did have to wait about 20 minutes because of the limit on visitor numbers but this meant a more easy climb and a less packed terrace.",
          "I went to visit the tower after having see \"St Mich\" (the French call it like that!). If you don't suffer of dizziness have a go on the Tower: it's great, Gothic style, and you can stop at 2 different panoramic level. Enjoy it: it will give you a great Panoramic View of",
          "A short queue when I went and a great view from up high. Fantastic when the bells ring! It also offered English translations which gave a greater insight to the history of the city than most other attractions. Added bonus was free for EU citizens under 25!",
          "The views are amazing! But, the only way up is by climbing steep stairs and they really do end... Take your time but I promise the views are so worth it! Take your camera. They limit the number in the tower so everyone can enjoy the beautiful views from the top.",
          "From the top of the tower you have an amazing view over the whole city and the surroundings. A nice thing is that they let only 28 people to be on the tower at the same time. Thanks to this measure you have plenty of space up there. The downside might be that you could have to",
          "If you're not afraid of tight winding staircases, then climb the tower (it's about 7 minutes of huffing and puffing if you're as unfit as me) and admire the view from above Bordeaux. We did this close to the beginning of our visit and it gave us a real sense of place for the",
          "An impressive buidling, serves as the bell tower for St Andrew's next door. We wanted to climb to the top but it was closed that day.",
          "Climb the tower for great views of the City. 231 steps up a circular staircase, not many places to stop. Would not recommend if too claustrophobic. We all thought it was worth the effort. Interesting that the tower was built apart from the church..found out that was to ensure",
          "Climbing the spiral staircase to the top was a challenge and not for everyone. Once at the top which is also a narrow space, the 360 degree view is wonderful. Wait for the bell to ring!",
          "Billed as providing the best views of Bordeaux. Probably true, but Bordeaux is a city best viewed from the ground to appreciate. Still enjoyed the 300 step climb and the fact that the tower was built separate from the cathedral was an interesting fact. Be warned however that",
          "Kick off your stilettos, slip into your comfy shoes and start climbing. You will be rewarded with a sweeping panoramic view of Bordeaux. Being basically a flat and low-rise town, you need to make your own views in Bordeaux. The Tower of Pey-Berland is the ideal place to do it.",
          "This tower is next to the St. Andre Cathedral. The First Terrace is covered on on this day, gratefully in that we were experiencing some light rain. At this level one has tremendous views over the city. There are landmark designations all around the terrace pointing our",
          "Very hard hike to the top ,I am not as fit as I used to be ! But the panorama is beautiful and you get a feeling of awe for the workers ,masons and others who built that tower at the end of the Middle Ages with traditional tools and machines ! I regretted the dry momies of my",
          "Awe inspiring tower detached from the main cathedral building, We did not go to the top as the weather was poor but there must be a wonderful view from the top.",
          "After living in Bordeaux for 6 months finally went up and the view was great, many churches and towers to see. Good to put the city into perespecive from this vantage point.",
          "We climbed the 231 steps and enjoyed fabulous views over the city, although be warned, the steps are steep and uneven so you would want to be fairly fit! It's free, or minimal cost depending on your age and status, so well worth a visit. Nice square around it too.",
          "If you do not like confined spaces, the climb is not for you. The stairs spiral all the way up and we had to pass by others going in the opposite direction on our way up and down. However, if you can make it up to the top, the view is fantastic. Well worth the effort.",
          "A bit harrowing climbing the 231 steps up the narrow winding steps, but we'll worth it for the excellent view over all of Bordeaux.",
          "You need to know that there are several steps to climb the roof but wow it's amazing the view. From that beautifull tower you gonna see the all old city.",
          "First the plaza is beautiful and animated. As for the cathedral tower it shows an amazing panorama above the great roofs of the city, with their peach colored ancient tiles and varied shapes.",
          "The Tower of Pey-Berland can be seen from any number of neighbouring boulevards (it is capped with a golden 'Our Lady of Aquitaine') but it's certainly worth a visit. The grounds are clean with plenty of room to sit and stare, added to which this Cathedral features something",
          "A spur of the moment decision to climb the bell towr - and worth the entry fee! Yes there are a few (a lot) of steps but the view at the top is worth it. Put it on your to-do list when visiting Bordeaux!",
          "After climbing 230 steps (with two stops....) I admired the beauty of the city and took panorama pictures. The next 3 days I spend in the city were cloudy and rainy therefor I will always remember the nice view from this tower.",
          "A little overpriced at 5.50each but well worth the 261step climb to get an appreciation for the beauty and architecture of Bordeaux. We went here on our first day in the city and it was a great starting point as we were able to seek out churches and landmarks in the city",
          "My daughter wanted to go up tot he top of the tower and I was feeling a bit athletic but this is some way up. When you get to the top it was well worth the pain, spectacular views of the city. \u20ac5 for an adult but kids go free, so a reasonable attraction.",
          "A tough climb, but worth it. The only attraction in town which offers a birds eye view. The cathedral looks very impressive from here, and one also sees the myriad of old rooftops in a haphazard display of colour.",
          "I'd just say fellow travellers should save that well-earned glass of wine until after climbing to the top, this isn't an ascent and descent for the faint-hearted. The lovely cooling breeze and spectacular vistas at the top are well worth the effort though!",
          "Its all about the views. The steps were a bit steep in places but its definitely worth a trip up. They close for lunch so don't go in the middle of the day!",
          "An amazing structure that gives you an amazing view of Bordeaux's center. The only negative, if you are not in a a shape, is the very narrow very steep numerous stairs.",
          "Incredible views of the city; the spiral gets tighter and tighter at the top and you have to shimmy between stones to get out onto the viewing area on top... worth it, just be aware that gets a bit tight at the top.",
          "After breakfast we took an amble through the city and discovered the Tower of Pey-Berland. Its simply wonderful and all you can do is stare in awe in its shadows. We were told there were spectacular views to be had at the top but we were unfortunate enough to be visiting at a",
          "Downtown Bordeaux, the Cathedrale and the Tower is just amazing. Take a ticket and climb to the top of the Pey Berland Tower. You will have an amazing view of the city",
          "Climbed the spiral staircase to the viewing area not quite at the top and got up enough nerve to walk out and take some great photo's. Afraid of heights but still managed. On to the top and even better views. Be careful as you go through the door at the top. It looks normal size",
          "However it is just a tower but on the other hand enormous and impressive! And the statue is glorious!",
          "Best views across Bordeaux city. Fascinating to compare the elegant facades with the rough tiled roofs, and to spot the bits of medieval masonry built into more modern buildings.",

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\nTour Pey-Berland (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "A small museum, well actually just the cellar of the former wine merchant who lived here. Enough though to gain an understanding of the wine trade and of course the role of the Chartrons district of Bordeaux. Nice sniffing session followed by a wine tasting. Really enjioyed",
          "It is interesting being in a merchant\u2019s wine cellar and reading the displays and guidebook, but what made this a five star attraction for me was the tasting at the end of the visit. Our host was a very knowledgeable young English person who allowed us (three Americans) to ask",
          "Lots of information. Relaxed environment. Fun and informational wine tasting. Nice gift shop with local wines and staff ready to help with decisions on local wines. We walked there from the Place de la Bourse in the morning and ate lunch after at a good cafe (recommended by one",

          "It's a tad out of the way. We took the tram from the center of the city. It is not handicap friendly as there are stairs, so a wheelchair cannot get down to the exhibit. There is no elevator. The translations into English were good and very helpful. The gentleman who did",

          "Off the beaten track. But hardly informative. Tasting under supervision of a 20 year old who had only just learned herself. Nice, but don\u2019t go out your way I\u2019d say!",
          "Staff were friendly and so generous with their time. I learned so much about Bordeaux and the regional wines as well as the connection between Bordeaux and other countries in Europe. You may take as long as you like on this tour exploring the cellars and education yourself",

          "Not a big museum but what's there is interesting. It even has that sightly dusty mushroomy smell of a chateau cave. Knowledgeable and friendly guide gave a good informative talk with the tasting, which included a genuine clairet...not easy to find elsewhere. Lots of good",

          "I thought it was a good informative visit! It's a little small, so probably about 45 mins/1 hour if you really read everything and watch all the videos. Plus, there's wine, and they tell you about undertones and scent notes, and all that stuff. And it's a really good price!",

          "What makes this place so interesting is the architecture of the building in stunning and can be seen almost anywhere in Bordeaux. If you do not choose to go in it is worth the walk on the riverside to get there and take in the building. Inside there is all you would want to know",
          "This little museum seems to me to be a better choice than the more expensive, glitzier La Cite du Vin if you want to learn about the history of wine in Bordeaux. To begin with, it's not a mob scene, and I like to get away from time to time from the crowds. And it's",
          "We wanted to have a complete experience related to wine in Bordeaux, so we went to Saint-\u00c9milion (wine yard area) and to the wine and affairs museum. I may say that it was a great experience. The museum tells you about the history at the end the tour, an aroma quiz and the wine",
          "We both very much enjoyed the museum visit. We chose this museum over the bigger more modern wine museum, Cite de Vin. We were given an English folder to follow but there were also good English translations for the key parts of the displays. This little museum housed in a",
          "A very informative stop. The highlight was the talk given by the sommelier. He was super nice and very knowledgeable. We were also introduced (it was new to me) and tasted a claret wine. These wines are not exported so Bordeaux is the place to try them.",
          "The museum itself is pretty modest, but the package includes a smelling quiz (get all twelve right and you win a bottle of wine - we managed four and thought we did well!), a talk on Bordeaux wines and a wine tasting with of two wines with enough wine to feel that you had a",
          "For \u20ac10 (\u20ac5 with CityPass), this place is a much better bang for your buck than the \u20ac20 Cit Du Vin. I actually learned a lot more about wine here, and guide Author is fantastic! If you\u2019re in Bordeaux for a limited time, let this be your first stop!",

          "I went to the museum on my own and ended up being the only native English speaker when it came to the wine tasting at the end. Thus, I got my own one on one wine tasting! (And you get to try some sweet snacks too!) All the girls who worked there were friendly and accommodating.",
          "It was a pleasure to see this interesting and new museum. A well spent two hour visit. Very recommended.",

          "Tucked down a small street not far from the river in the first arrondissement if Bordeaux. Super interesting museum that is really easy to wander through at your own pace. Excellent displays of the history of development of Bordeaux (in wine, obviously, but also other trade).",
          "I have to qualify my review by saying that I study wine and my expectation may have been too high. The museum is likely great to those who have little or no prior wine knowledge. If you can tell the difference between the two banks of Bordeaux you may get bored.",
          "Had a really good time looking at some of the history of Bordeaux & wine-making in the region. Museum may be small, but has a lot packed into it. The wine tasting afterwards was very informative & fun with an aroma test thrown in while we waited for others to catch up. A decent",

          "Remarkably good value! For only \u20ac10 each we got to enjoy the exhibits at our own pace (there is an English language guide book provided) and sample a couple of wines. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. They took the took the time to be personal and shared",

          "Go here BEFORE you visit the vineyards, to learn all about wine production, terroir, methods worldwide, etc. Allow at least 2 hours, and be prepared to study! It's $20 euros to get in, and that's the minimum.",
          "The building is excellent but its a drag to get there The tours are interesting but when you get to the wine tasting its a push with no one having time to truly explain the wines to you",

          "It is centrally located in Bordeaux City just off the river promenade. Was very informative of the history of Bordeaux City relative to its wine industry. Enjoyed touring this museum more than the Citi du Vin museum, since it focused on the specific history of Bordeaux and its",

          "This is such an interesting little museum. If you are interested in Bordeaux wines, the history, the story of the development, marketing and sale of these wines, then this is the museum to visit. Not too difficult to find, it is marked on most maps, a tram stop nearby",
          "This small museum in the cellar of a building that housed a wine broker has a TON of interesting information about the wine trade in Bordeaux and the history of the city. I'm sure many people skip it to go to La Cite de Vin, but if you're interested in wine, I would say this is",
          "Many hands on activity and videos makes the visit fun. You get to taste some wine on the upper floor. Although museum is interesting the view from the upper floor is not all that great. It is a commercial harbor. The restaurant is very good amd definitely worth a stop. Parking",

          "An absolute bargain. Very friendly and informed staff who were approachable, and gave a great wine talk after the tour of the museum. A lovely museum - quaint, and not too big to get bored. Lots of information. You can view everything in your own time. A good shop with",

          "This was a very nice experience. The girls are well informed and impart with their knowledge easily and effortless. We enjoyed the electronic displays about making of oak barrels and traditional corks very much. No hype or commercial influence, just proper knowledge presented",
          "This is an old-fashioned type of museum - they give you a booklet in your language to take round with you. It gives a good background to the Bordeaux wine industry and as its in an old cellar it has atmosphere (even if a little dusty). The two wines they give you at the end",

          "The museum was not bad. Not really enticing, but fairly extensive. The wine tasting at the end was very rushed and we only sampled two different wines. Really it was an advert for the wines you could buy in the shop. Overall, the museum has done a good job of showing the history",
          "This was an informative overview of the wine and trade in Bordeaux followed by a tasting of two wines. Good basic tasting information. It was great value as a student.",
          "The place is small and poorly organised. I was given a booklet with about 25 pages to read with information about the museum. A lot of that information was on posters already and it just made the visit a bit confusing. The place contains some interesting information about trade",

          "The museum does not really offer much for wine specialists. (Maybe we are biased by the superb wine museum we visited in Riogga in Spain!) Afer the visit a brief wine tasting is offered. For those who need an explanation of the complexities of the Bordeaux region, this is very",
          "3 days ago I was at the 'maison du vin' in Bergerac, where I selected 6 or 7 wines I wanted to try. I bought 6 bottles. There was also a video presentation in English. It was free. Therefore surprised to pay \u20ac10 here and even more surprised when we only got two fairly average",
          "The museum is good, we walked though and then did the tasting. The host was a young lady, she was a bit new and her English was not perfect but she did a good job. We were disappointed that we only got to try 2 wines, and only a very small amount of each.",
          "This is a fun venue for a wine museum: the actual home and cellar of a wine merchant. The museum is relatively new and has a few technilogical issues, but it explains the wine trade quite well. The price of the ticket includes a wine tasting session that is very educational.",
          "Because I didn't stay in Bordeaux long enough to do an wine tour I opted for this attraction instead. This is a small museum where you learn about the history of wine and trade. At the end of the little tour you get to taste two samples of wine. Before the wine tastings you play",

          "We went because we like wine and weren't disappointed. The museum bit is not world shattering, but interesting. The real fun was being given an aroma test made into a competition with my partner-harder than you'd think. Then we had a nice wine tasting with a short lesson on",

          "During my visit in Bordeaux I chose one one museum, and this was it. \nEntry is 10 euro, you get a self-guide book. \nThe museum is not big, but you can see the history of wine inside. \nAt the end there is wine tasting (2 glasses of wine) and a great lecture on wine regions around the city. \nI highly recommend this museum.",

          "A small museum where you can explore about the history of wine trade, followed by wine tasting. They'll also tell you about the wine making in Bordeaux. You'll learn quite a lot. Student discounts available, so it's worth the money.",
          "A fantastic stop if you want to learn about the history of wine and Bordeaux.",
          "Highly recommend visiting this small museum as the staff hosting the wine tasting was delightful, super fun and we learned a lot.  There is of course a larger wine museum nearby but it's a high-tech extravaganza designed for mass tourism and lacks any personal touch, pushing expensive bottles.",

          "We were eager to see the famous Chaban Delmas bridge over the River Garonne (2013) and were rather disappointed. The lift-bridge may be an exceptional technical feat but, looking at it from Quai de Bacalan on a late afternoon, we mainly saw four very high and slender pylons",
          "We cycled over this bridge on our Bordeaux Bike Experience tour. It was worth doing because you get a good view of the Garonne river. It's also an impressive feat of engineering with the central section of the bridge platform able to be raised in twelve minutes to let cruise",
          "This bridge was built to allow the big cruise ships to ahv access to the central part of the city and the docks. Since the ships are so big--tall and wide, a creative way had to be developed to let them pass. This one raises the street (in a section much longer than a football",

          "Very interesting design as the whole centre of the bridge is raised by over 20 giant steel ropes each side. We never saw it raised and it takes over an hour to raise but it must have been done as we saw two different cruise ships up stream of the bridge.",
          "We sailed under this lifting bridge before we docked at the quay in Bordeaux. The centre raises up between the two large pillars and is amazing to see. Once we docked the centre of the bridge was lowered and the traffic resumed. The same happened when we left Bordeaux 3 days",
          "was hoping to see this bridge raised but was not to be - we did have a couple of cruise ships come in but at unearthly hours",

          "I know there are many posts about this bridge, but it's such a clean architectural design that I can't help myself. After having crossed the old lift bridge in Houghton, Michigan in July...built with enough steel for a small skyscraper...it was quite a contrast to experience",
          "You can see the modern style bridge from many places by the Garonne River. If you go to the Cite du Vin area, then you are right by the bridge and you will see it better. I am not sure if you can or want to tour it...we didn't.",

          "Sadly no boats were passing under the bridge when we were there but I love the fact that the lights on it change to indicate whether it is low or high tide. It gives the city an air of modernity and confidence as well as allowing larger ships to dock. Looks wonderful at night.",
          "Architecturally superb and visually pleasing, the centre section can be raised to allow large ships to pass, sadly none when we were there. Tram line B to Cit\u00e9e de Vin or river taxi to pass under, well worth a trip",
          "Iconic bridge over the Garonne. Easy to find with good promenades on both banks. Well worth a walk up either side for a great view of the river and the city. We were lucky enough to see it raised twice during our stay.",
          "This is one of the places that i wouldn't make an effort to go and see. It is just a random bridge in Bordeaux.",
          "The water mirror is stunning and a mist appears every 20 minutes reallyvwirth a visit and if course is free. Was exciting to see the Bridge open for a large cruise liner",
          "The most amazing bridge...looks fab and the centre raises to allow boats through. Wonderful to see working",
          "We went by on a day without the bridge opening so it was an ordinary bridge with turrets. Time it for a cruise ship.",
          "We had no chance up to now to see any bridge similar to this so we were nicely surprised seeing the way how it opens. At the moment we visited this bridge there was even somer local boat race so it was all spectacular!",
          "Very unusual way of opening and we were lucky enough to see it in action as a cruise ship arrived in Bordeaux. To see the whole road lifted in a horizontal position through perhaps 20M is an interesting spectacle",
          "Great view, nice shape over the river. Interesting way of opening up and we had the pleasure of seeing a cruise ship go through it. At the end of the day it is just a bridge though. Take a bit of time to see it, but it's not an imperative.",
          "The riverside area of Bordeaux is full of interest and stretches for a total of 4km. At the northern end, one of the sights that definitely catches the eye is this very large, modern bridge. Opinion is divided on whether it is beautiful or not (I come down on the side of 'not')",
          "A stunning and elegant bridge that perfectly contrasts with the ancient bridge at the other end of the port. It took a while but eventually a significant cruise liner was guided in stern first. Like much of the river front in Bordeaux the bridge is lit up at night.",
          "this is a bridge technically, but it has a unique feature of opening up. it is awkward and weird, but even shocking and amazing at the same time. they do not open the bridge in the day. they open at night only because it disrupts the traffic on the road. the boats can pass from",
          "A beautiful bridge that raises the entire deck on cables rather than opening as a swing or draw bridge. It's opening disrupts road traffic for two hours so they do it late at night, and have big signs saying when it will happen. Walk out on the bridge for the best view of City",
          "While this bridge opens for larger boats and river traffic we never saw any boats which needed that service. Instead the bridge appears to be opened on a Sunday as a \"test\" or as a tourist attraction.",
          "Bordeaux is far bigger than I imagined it to be - I don't know why. The bridge is very impressive but we wouldn't have seen it if it had not be for the bus tour which goes over it. It would be amazing to see it raised up to let the cruise ships up the river but I believe this",
          "We could see this bridge when we went canoeing, Its really wonderful, definitely worth going to see. Was really good on Canoes as you got the history explained to you as well.",
          "Not only is this bridge a magnificent structure but the engineering that went into its development makes this a worthwhile visit",
          "We sailed under it on the water taxi and walked over it ...an amazing structure. It would be great to see it lifting for a ship but great to see it none the less. Very striking.",
          "Tram ride to end of the line then walk past this bridge,or cycle under the tunnel. Nice piece of engineering. The Garrine a fast flowing river.",
          "It doesn't seem so, but the entire center section gets lifted on pulleys in the towers. Elegant and almost completely hidden engineering. Good view from the Cit\u00e9 de Vin, or from the restaurants on either bank.",
          "Amazing new bridge that lifts up for cruise ships and holds traffic up for 2 hours !! The tour bus was a great way to see the other side of the river and explain the areas",
          "This is a lovely, modern bridge with a minimal, clean look. It is a contrast to the older parts of the city, but combined with the modern Cite du Vin building behind I find them both elegant and as there is a lot of construction going on in this area at the moment, hopefully the",
          "We didn't go up the columns but it is a beautifully designed and engineered bridge. Amazing what they did with it.",
          "Spend few days jogging through the bridge and surrounding the park while sightseeing. Many people in the evening but not so much early in the morning.",
          "Giving access to the outer corners of Bordeaux Well in keeping with the architecture of this great city.",
          "We walked across the bridge unfortunately it seldom raises out of peak season but the centre section is raised by cables, a tremendous feat.",
          "This is a very interesting looking new bridge. I was told that rather than act as a typical drawbridge, the span can be raised and lowered as needed, like an elevator.",
          "This is a comparatively new bridge across the Garonne. It is a modern version of a swing bridge. The part between the \"towers\" can be raised to allow the passage of boats. Sadly we didn't see this happen. If you go to the Cit\u00e9 du Vin it is close by. Very interesting modern",
          "Interesting to take a short boat trip to the La Cite du Vin and view the bridge. Take the BAT boat, it's cheap and frequent,",
          "We took the water taxi to the Wine Museum and passed under this bridge. As you're approaching it looks like a lovely modern bridge but as you get closer you see the detail and how the middle portion is lifted, super cool! I got a few great shots if the bridge while the sun was",
          "Heard about this bridge online and how beautiful it is at night. Unfortunately for us, due to the long European summer nights, we waited for as long as we could, but the lights just refused to turn on during our visit, so we can't judge personally. From what we can see during",
          "A long bridge with middle portion being able to be lifted,allowing the passage of ships.The middle portion rests on four pillars which are pulled up with the help of metal ropes.",
          "When I saw the bridge I did not understand what was the function of those towers. Then I noticed the innovative system they used. It is admirable, but I strongly believe it is more from a boat. That\u00b4s why that I recomend to go on foot from the water mirror to the Cite du Vin and",
          "We walked across this bridge as it not only looks interesting but is an innovative way of allowing large cruise ships into the river. The road raises vertically to enable very large cruise ships access to the river beyond.",
          "This is an impressive bridge and best seen from the ferry or river cat which winds its way up and down the estuary.",
          "Nice modern looking bridge with peculiar design including four towers that can be seen on the way to the wine museum neighbourhood that seems to be upcoming with many constructions.",
          "I have seen this bridge a few times on my trips to Bordeaux but never seen it being raised. It is worth a quick look especially if you are visiting the nearby Cite Du Vin. I would say you need to spend too long here to see it though.",
          "As a visitor of this amazing city, it is sure that you will see this beautiful bridge. So clever and innovative idea to combine modern engineering with the \"classic\" European architecture. The most impressive is when the bridge lifts to the top in order a ship to pass under of",
          "The bridge deserves a walk to see it close. You can see it from far but walk along the wharf or the docks and you will discover more of it. The walk along the docks is already a great walk on a sunny day. But the best is to finish on the bridge after the walk. And then you can",
          "Despite its design and innovative technology, this book integrates perfectly with the architecture of the city classified UNSESCO heritage. A real show during the passage of a cruiser boat or tall ship.",
          "A very impressive example of lifting span bridge, with obvious attention to its appearance being well in keeping with the river views. Practical and most attractive.",
          "By day or by night an iconic bridge near the Les Hangars warehouse district (now trendy) and the equally iconic Vin du Cite building.",
          "This beautiful piece of modern architecture spans the Garonne and the four towers lift the central section to allow tall ships to pass.",
          "Interesting how the whole middle part raises to let the ships sail through! Very modern for Bordeaux.",
          "Interesting bridge located across the Garonne river near the Cite Du Vin. It is easily visible when on the riverside Quai.",
          "We drove over this bridge several times, and then were lucky enough to see the mid-section lifted to allow a large yacht to pass . Quite an amazing feat of engineering, and a beautiful bridge to look at as well.",
          "This new bridge is spectacular, especially at night. It changes from green to blue depending on the direction of the tide. River boats can go under it but other boats require it to lift.",
          "Quite impressive in it's simplicity. We were lucky enough to see it raised when a cruise ship came in. Lovely at night.",
          "Impressive structure. Good for a photo op. It raises itself to allow the cruise ships to enter the city.",
          "That is no Pont de Pierre. Modern, practical but I find it ugly which is a shame since it is named after a famous mayor and prime minister of France who was quite handsome.",
          "so this was a revenge visit for the wife as she had dragged me around the cathedrals. and id dint seem to work as she was really impressed with it so much that we drove back over it and parked up and went for a walk along the river so we could get a better view.",
          "We saw this Bridge in the Raised position, And it truely looks like some thing out of a Sci Fi Movie Brilliant As its free to view Better still !",
          "Take a bike and go take a look. If you have luck a cruise ship comes in and you can see how the middle part is raised. Next to the bridge is a boulevard (west side) filled with restaurants and bars.",
          "Wow - this is a fantastic structure, so modern against the skyline. At night the bridge is illuminated in blue and looks really beautiful.",
          "The center of this bridge slides up to let ships go through. We got to see it up while we were in Le Cite de Vin. Stayed up for a long time. A large cruise ship came out. Cruise ships are now coming in to Bordeaux. Hope they don't ruin the atmosphere in the city of",
          "The Motor Yacht 'A' designed by P Starck and owned Mr Malichenko was the 'star' of the Bourdeaux water front during our visit and the only reason why the bridge went up and down.",
          "We used the android phone app that tells the bridge schedule, which is excellent. We sat for lunch at a cafe by the hangars on the dock with a great view and watched the bridge open for two ships. Very impressive, worth seeing, but it is just a bridge.",
          "We would have liked to see this bridge opening, but could not find a time schedule. It did open sometime the following morning to let a ship pass underneath. The tour looked expensive so we did not bother. Just an amazing structure worthy of a few photographs.",
          "Very exciting for anyone remotely interested in architecture. The middle section rises up to let ships through. The rise lasted an hour when we were there which must have pleased the waiting traffic no end. Bordeaux is an amazing city full of innovations and this adds to it.",
          "This is certainly a piece of excellent design and engineering. We saw it from above and from the water on the ferry boat. What a magnificent structure.",
          "I lke a human creation, certainly not a typical bridge where engineers have given vent to their ideas.",
          "This stunning piece of functional engineering is also an impressive statement on the rive and landscape. We saw the above while walking the quays one evening, and the below ... the following afternoon. Either way, a most impressive and pleasing sight. Thank you.",
          "The central section of road rises many meters above the river to allow large ships to pass underneath. It's a modern work of art as well as an engineering triumph. Do not miss it .",
          "We have never seen a elevator bridge, is definitely worth of visit but is a bit longer walk near river to get there.",
          "The Jacques Chaban Delmas bridge is a recently installed bridge, and its architecture reflects it. With four pillars of metal and glass, and with LED lights shining from them at night, it is a modern and interesting bridge. Worth a quick photo stop.",
          "The city of Bordeaux offers a ferry trip as part of its public transport network. Grab a ticket for less than 2 euros and enjoy a trip on the river until La Cit\u00e9e Des Vins. If you don't feel like visiting the wine museum you can go back with the tramway with the same ticket.",
          "I have not see a bridge quite like this! The bridge center raises the platform like an elevator instead of a drawbridge, so ships can pass under. If you are on a cruise ship, make a point to be on deck whenyou ship departs or enters Bordeaux! Besides the engineering",
          "nice bridge that will take 2 hour to open de complete bridge it looks very attractive.And the view from the bridge over de gironde is so nice",
          "A bit out of the way, this bridge is quite a distance from the city hub if walking. We were lucky to visit when there was a cruise ship in town so saw the bridge raised to accommodate.",
          "...but quite interesting to see if you are into bridges. More to the point the Cite La Vin is just by here...it is the strange wooden building which the French go for. I didn't go to the Cite le Vin but was reliably informed it was worth it for vinophiles.",
          "This is a stunning bridge that lifts up like an elevator for the large cruise ships that enter Bordeaux. We drove over it and also saw it on our boat trip. Magnificent!",
          "The latest bridge in Bordeaux, next to the new wine palace, brings about the best of French architecture. The four towers carry the bridge itself up into the air to let even the largest vessel pass underneath. Hopefully you are there when the bridge is up, but worth a visit at",
          "A new bridge (three years old) with the world's highest vertical lift of the central span, This allows huge passenger liners to dock in Bordeaux's Port of the Moon.",
          "Worth the tram trip to visit this amazing piece of engineering. Walk across and great great views of the Bordeaux river front.",
          "The Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas is an example of modern architecture. France. It was opened on 16 March 2013. Perfect place for a beautiful picture.",
          "This is quite an impressive work of clever engineering. It is absolutely amazing what the human mind can achieve. It is a beautiful bridge with some really stunning views.",
          "Stroll along the Bridge for some great photos - or get your exercise by doing the 2 Bridges walk! From Pont de Pierre along the right bank of the river and after crossing The Jacques Chaban Delmas Bridge stop for a refreshing drink or lunch on the Quai - or continue on to the",
          "The bridge itself is nice no see and very modern. It's especially worth seeing when boats are going through the bridge. The view from the bridge is great. One side you have a nice view on \"la cit\u00e9 des vins\" and on the otherside you have a view on the docks. It's worth walking",
          "The best way to see this engineering wonder is by the very inexpensive bateau boat bus. You can use your tram ticket up to an hour and if you plan well the whole trip can cost you as low as \u20ac1.50 Up close the engineering is fascinating and awe inspiring.",
          "We were interested in this bridge when we were looking at Bordeaux information before our visit and we took a river cruise that went under it. We were very glad that we took the time to see it, as it is a beautiful piece of modern engineering Unfortunately, the centre part of",
          "This bridge really shines at night. Literally. Unfortunately didn't get to see the centre part raise to let cruise ships in and out of the Gironde (despite checking cruise itineraries). There is a also a tour but i was happy just to stroll across the bridge at night and",
          "A nice bridge to see and a perfect place to take pictures. However we waited much to see it in action but were disappointed as no ships passed by...",
          "Was very interesting watching the Pont Jacques lift the middle section up the let the cruise ships in, or out!!",
          "We saw the bridge lit up in the night, then we were able to go under it, beautiful bridge and amazing construction. It is something you should go out of your way to see when in Bordeaux, especially in the night.",
          "We started walking the riverfront Garrone in front of the Royal Palace when we decided it walk all the way to this bridge. It is something to see and you can actually walk on it. It has a platform that can be raised when big ships come in to the river. It is not your typical",
          "By taking a river cruise you can go under this amazing bridge and see the workings. If you are close by when a cruise ship comes into Bordeaux then you will see the middle section lift up to let it pass. It is near quayside shops and right beside the new Musee du Vin which",
          "I never saw such a lifting bridge before, where the whole plattform gets moved upwards. Great piece of engineering.",
          "Easily visible from the riverfront, this is an engineering marvel with a strong futuristic architecture. Instead of opening in a traditional way, the entire center section rises (like a table).",
          "If you want to discover the city of Bordeaux along the Garonne river you must go and see this new bridge The view is terrific !",
          "Impressive modern and interesting bridge architecturally (it lifts to allow ocean going cruise liners through).",
          "We got the overview (or underview from the boat) of this new-ish raising bridge, the centre lifts up 53 metres to allow cruise ships to enter the Garonne towards Bordeaux. It would be good to see in action.",
          "We cycled over this several times as we wanted to reach the shops and restaurants on the Quayside. It's a great design and it was a shame it wasn't due to lift. A good view of the new City of Wine.",
          "It is a cool bridge to watch during the day, but if you are having a drink anywhere along the quai it is great to watch the bridge light up at night and is an absolutely stunning site.",
          "The history behind its construction is very interesting. The design is unique as well as the engineering elements.",
          "This lift bridge is named after the resistance leader who later became mayor of Bordeaux and President of France. Jaques Chaban Delmas's statue can be found in cathedral square.",
          "Loved this bridge from its conception: bold design, fitting in with the old stone waterfronts, without shocking the Unesco inner city. Took the image to design the logo for the new Gaelic Football team in the Metropole - the Burdigaela (added an \"e\" as a play on words of the",
          "Very interesting engineering on this bridge To allow the cruise ships into Bordeaux, the complete middle section raises. Very modern. Slight incline so easy to walk or bike across.",
          "For years, Le Pont de Pierre was the only bridge across the Garonne. We bicycled to Le Pont Jacques Chaban Delmas, a very modern architectural masterpiece. Make sure to visit, even if you don\u2019t cross it.",
          "With Bordeaux having kept its older style buildings, this bridge does not (personally) really fit in with the older style of the city. This does not mean to say that it is not fascinating to look at and a wonderful piece of architecture. Located to the north end, accessible via",
          "Ce pont qui date du 16 Mars 201\" et surprenant par son architecture - The Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas is a vertical-lift bridge over the Garonne in Bordeaux, France.

          "The bridge is impressive for sure and a fantastic place to take a run. It was the highlight of my run. You can see some amazing views of the city from the center of the bridge.",
          "We were on a river cruise on the Garonne River and were fortunate enough to see the midsection lift to allow a cruise ship to pass through. It is a truly magnificent modern piece of engineering. It was also worth seeing at night when it was lit up",
          "This bridge was name after the former Mayor of Bordeaux. It certainly is beautiful, elegant, and with the French touch. The modern bridge design does seem out of place with the rest of architecture in downtown Bordeaux. However, I think it will blend very well with the new",
          "We walked all the way from the center to see this bridge, and it's an impressive sight. Too bad it didn't open when we were there. I don't really like the design myself; I feel the towers could have been more than what they are.",
          "On the Garonne in Bordeaux, this is the newest bridge and has a lifting midsection to let in Tallships and cruiseships. On the bridge it has separate pedestrian and bycicle lanes. Making this the completion of a bycicle roundtrip between the 2 bridges in Bordeaux. beautiful",
          "It might be a mechanical marvel but it is still just a bridge. The only reason i can see to visit the bridge is the views it offers of Bordeaux",
          "Nice modern bridge which access to the greeny side of the river opposite to Bordeaux city center. Can be used to make a circle round trip by the bicycle along the river side.",
          "This unique landmark drawbridge allows tall ships to access Bordeaux by lifting the entire roadway to the top of the four massive pylons. An excellent piece of engineering design that has become a modern icon for Bordeaux.",
          "The design of this amazing bridge is a bit of a mystery until you realise that cruise liners need to pass under it to get to the preferred berths at Place de la Bourse right in Bordeaux city centre. The centre section lifts right up in one piece supported by enormouse cables",
          "Had lunch by the bridge one Sunny day and admired the bridge and the views of the other side of Bordeaux.Very modern yet does not spoil the landscape",
          "A new bridge in the city is challenging the Old Stone one. A nice structure, with lights during the night.",
          "While you can see this from across the river, it is worth going over to view close up. It is such a beautiful structure and and an amazing engineering feat!",
          "Took a river cruise which sailed under this bridge named for a previous mayor of Bordeaux. We had to wait as the deck of the bridge gracefully settled back in place before we could progress. Close up you can see how the whole road bed is lifted up the bridge pillars. Amazing bit",
          "Ok I don't get to hung up about modern bridges but this one is something special as the centre part lifts up to allow ocean going cruise ships to enter and tie up alongside the impressive Bordeaux waterfront. It opened twice while we were there but annoyingly I wasn't able to",
          "Walking across it you get some nice views of the Garonne. It's interesting to look at but nothing special. At night when it's lit up its quite pretty.",
          "Watching the deck of this bridge rise horizontally has to be seen to believed. Sit in one of the new terrace cafes in the old harbour dockside area and enjoy.",
          "We were lucky enough to be there when the bridge was opening, so that a big tourist ships could enter the city. The bridge is very impressive!",
          "So its a new bridge,quite a clever design but if you walk over from the centre of town it leads you into the industrial part of Bordeaux which has little to offer the visitor.",
          "Obviously an amazing design and a brilliant bit of engineering given that it rises up and down for shops to go through. But at the end of the day its only a bridge. Does it really justify being categorised as the 5th top attraction in Bordeaux?",
          "My husband was fascinated by this bridge. Saw it raised and lowered a couple of times, once when the Frigate L'Hermione was leaving Bordeaux. Also walked across - great views of Bordeaux.",
          "The bridge itself is of a very modern design and may look somewhat out of place for Bordeaux but when you realize that the entire deck raises to allow large cruise ships under it then you can apprieciate it more.",
          "If you are in Bordeaux you really cannot miss it, but you need to understand what you are seeing. This bridge is just a few years old and replaced the previous drawbridge. We were on a cruise ship that went under this bridge. How you may ask? Well, think of the part between",
          "I did not see it in action - and then it was a boring bridge, even in the evening. Maybe it is something for bridge-enthusiasts?",
          "The bridge is well designed, with its towers illuminated at night. On one evening we had supper with a view of it. Our disappointment was that we left Bordeaux several hours before a very large cruise liner was due to go through it; that would have been worth seeing.",
          "we sat at the a restart at night it looked very nice lights reflected the water movement in a very soothing way.",
          "Look, it is a bridge, so how much excitement can one get, except when the center is rising and a large sea going tour ship enters the area. Then it is pretty interesting.",
          "Cool, clean modern lines with brilliant engineering that makes drawbridges obsolete. We saw it from the Quai de Chartrons and the Viking sun deck, then we passed under it. (Be alert enough not to be below decks when this happens!) See it during the day, then lighted at night.",
          "We passed under the bridge onboard the Regent Voyager and had a close-up look. It would have been nice to see it in action but its sleek modern design is a contrast to the older world it connects. Probably worth five stars if we saw it in operation.",
          "We were on a river cruise in Bordeaux and noticed some much larger ships also docked on the riverfront. Our captain explained that one of these ships would depart at 11 pm and that it would be worth watching. Indeed it was. The bridge was brightly lit and slowly the central",

          "Take a walk in the morning along the river or catch a tram on the red line, there are some cafes where you can sit and watch the bridge open up, then see the monstrous cruise liners come though followed by the hard working tug - looks like the tug is pushing the liner down the",
          "Found out when the lift was and we headed down next morning to see it! Very impressive how they steer those huge cruise liners under it. We sat and had a coffee at the bank of the river and watched the spectacle. It normally opens a little earlier than stated and then closes",
          "We were very fortunate in that we were able to see the bridge open up. We were on a cruise ship coming through early morning. The architecture of the bridge is amazing. This is a good place to stroll. Don't miss it at night when it is lit up.",
          "Even if engineering is not your thing, it's worth visiting this bridge. Also a great cycle route - looping along both sides of La Garonne. The harder part is spotting it going up as it does not happen all that often - but do keep an eye out. It's pretty cool.",
          "I helped on the building of this bridge. I installed the bridge deck with our company. So very proud of 5his beautiful bridge.",
          "If you're a fan of architecture, this is a must visit. It's an impressive bridge with an impressive architecture.",
          "We agree w/ one of the reviews before. It is a bit further. But really worthy. It is approx 2km from the center. If you are a jogger even better, apparently there is a route going here (many people). If you aren't, no worries, there are many benches to have a quick snack or bars",
          "I'd seen photos, and thought 'meh'. Then I strolled up there on a gloriously sunny spring afternoon, along with what felt like three quarters of Bordeaux. And the bridge is actually seriously impressive when seen first-hand. Makes you wish you were an engineer.",
          "It's a bridge. A shiny, hi-tech, high-rising bridge. Unless you're an engineer there's not much to get excited about. UNLESS: You're in that crazy kind of love where you want to put padlocks on bridges with your names on and throw the key in the river, like they do on the Pont",
          "This bridge has to be seen in action to be believed. Check out the Bordeaux Tourist website for the schedule of when the bridge is to rise. The whole central section of the bridge rises on hydraulic lifts that are operated from the top of one of the four towers. Spectacular at",
          "This striking bridge has a central section with 4 concrete pylons which enables it to lift up the three parallel roadways over the Garonne and allows cruise ships to berth at the Chartrons piers near the city centre. You can reach it by tram line B getting off at the adjacent",
          "I have to admit that it took sometimes to me to understand the mechanism used in this Bridge to get \"open\" to the Massive Boat that can go through it, and once I understood how it works.... WOW!!!!!!! Have a walk on it and have a boat'trip close to it and you'll see how much",

Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:\n\n\n=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===\nSince 1947, there have been 5 mayors of Bordeaux:\n\nRPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to Les Republicains in 2015\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).\nThe University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\n\nThe University Bordeaux 1, (Maths, Physical sciences and Technologies), 10,693 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Segalen (Medicine and Life sciences), 15,038 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 3, Michel de Montaigne (Liberal Arts, Humanities, Languages, History), 14,785 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 4, Montesquieu (Law, Economy and Management), 12,556 students in 2002\nInstitut of Political Sciences of Bordeaux.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096.

The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\nTour Pey-Berland (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "I go with the flow of recent reviews: the medieval wing is not up to much - too many second rate pieces from unknown (and often anonymous) artists, only the Bruegel stands out. Not worth more than 15 minutes (and only two stars). But when you move across to the north wing",
          "As other reviewers have commented, there are two wings making up this museum. The wing covering the earlier period is relatively modest, with little medieval art. There are a few artists exhibited (such as Ramsay) whom one wouldn't normally expect to see in a provincial French",

          "The Statue of \"The Death of Mozart\" is one of the finest we have ever seen. Simply stunning. The Museum is divided into 2 wings, pre and post 1800. The pre side was almost exclusively religious in theme, something we get tired of. The post 1800 wing had the above mentioned",

          "Not a blockbuster museum, but, especially in the wing with the more modern works, there are some nice surprises. The gardens are beautiful. I'd never heard of Albert Marquet, a member of the Fauvist movement and friend of Matisse. The museum has a large collection of his work",

Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:\n\n\n=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===\nSince 1947, there have been 5 mayors of Bordeaux:\n\nRPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to Les Republicains in 2015\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nThe university was created by the archbishop Pey Berland in 1441 and was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution, before reappearing in 1808 with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).\nThe University of Bordeaux is divided into four:\n\nThe University Bordeaux 1, (Maths, Physical sciences and Technologies), 10,693 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Segalen (Medicine and Life sciences), 15,038 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 3, Michel de Montaigne (Liberal Arts, Humanities, Languages, History), 14,785 students in 2002\nThe University Bordeaux 4, Montesquieu (Law, Economy and Management), 12,556 students in 2002\nInstitut of Political Sciences of Bordeaux.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

          "It's amazing how quickly one can take things for granted as a tourist. Wandering around Bordeaux' old town with its narrow streets, many squares and its rather Italian feel one soon starts taking it all for granted. But really, sitting in this lovely, buzzy square drinking wine",

        "wiki": "Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [b\u0254\u0281do] (listen); Gascon Occitan: Bord\u00e8u [bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw]) is a port city on the Garonne in the Gironde department in Southwestern France.\nThe municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole that has a population of 796,273 (2019), the 5th largest in France after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille with its immediate suburbs and closest satellite towns. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 1,232,550 (2016). It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"Bordelais\" (for men) or \"Bordelaises\" (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nBeing France's most prominent wine region, with 3,37 Billion \u20ac turnover it is both the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region hosting the world's most renowned estates, and a prominent powerhouse exercising significant influence on the world's wine and spirits industry, although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 5th Century BC to the 11th Century ===\n\nAround 300 BC the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. It continued to flourish, especially during the Severan dynasty (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of Roman Aquitaine. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument Les Piliers de Tutelle.\n\n\t\t\nIn 276 it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short.  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (Frontiacus, Franciacus) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (Wascones), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778 Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass[9]-. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.\n\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess El\u00e9onore of Aquitaine to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in Le Mans, who within months of their wedding became King Henry II of England. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. It was also the capital of an independent state under Edward, the Black Prince (1362\u20131372), but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century ===\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the West Indies, along with its traditional wine exports.Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\". Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\nTowards the end of the Peninsula war on 12 March 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons, so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n\t\t\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This recurred during the World War I and again very briefly during the World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German Occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana) established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from this base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around 500 km (310 mi) southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), or in the Trewartha climate classification system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches 21 to 22 \u00b0C (70 to 72 \u00b0F)). The average seasonal winter temperature is 7.1 \u00b0C (44.8 \u00b0F), but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is 20.7 \u00b0C (69.3 \u00b0F). The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of 23.3 \u00b0C (73.9 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nAs of 2014, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\n\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about 116,160 hectares (287,000 acres) of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five premier cru (first growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies. This project, carried by the French Ministry of Defence, involves an investment of 2 billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of regional planning, promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n\n=== Major companies ===\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n\nArena\nGroupe Bernard\nGroupe Castel\nCdiscount\nDassault\nJock\nMarie Brizard\nMcKesson Corporation\nOxbow\nRicard\nSanofi Aventis\nSmurfit Kappa\nSNECMA\nSolectron\nThales Group\n\n\n== Population ==\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to urban sprawl, so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall metropolitan area of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n\nPopulation Over Time\n\nLargest communities of foreigners :\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential elections of 2007 ===\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Beatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\nOnly candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed\n\n\n=== Municipal administration ===\n\nThe Mayor of the city is Nicolas Florian.\nVirginie Calmels is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde.

The city is home to 362 monuments historiques (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, Port of the moon, has been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nMain sights include:\n\nPlace de la Bourse (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect Jacques Gabriel as landscape for an equestrian statue of Louis XV, now replaced by the Fountain of the Three Graces.\nGrand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\nAll\u00e9es de Tourny\nCours de l'Intendance\nPlace du Chapelet\nPlace du Parlement\nPlace des Quinconces, the largest square in France.\nMonument aux Girondins\nPlace Saint-Pierre\nPont de pierre (1822)\nSaint Andrew's Cathedral, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\nTour Pey-Berland (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in Romanesque style\nThe Gothic Basilica of Saint Michael, constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\nBasilica of Saint Severinus, the most ancient church in Bordeaux. It was built in the early 6th century on the site of a palaeochristian necropolis. It has an 11th-century portico, while the apse and transept are from the following century.

Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.Today a lot of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon deLad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nJardin public de Bordeaux, with inside the Jardin botanique de Bordeaux\nJardin botanique de la Bastide\nParc bordelais\nParc aux Ang\u00e9liques\nJardin des Lumi\u00e8res\nParc Rivi\u00e8re\nParc Floral\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===\nEurope's longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is 117-metre-long (384-foot) and can be lifted vertically up to 53 metres (174 feet) to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrian-only shopping street has 1.2 kilometers (0.75 mi) of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, Arc en r\u00eave. Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a 45 km (28 mi) ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of 30 km/h (19 mph) became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at 60 km/h (37 mph). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nSince July 2017, the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\n\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n\n4 tram lines (A, B, C and D)\n75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\nAn electric bus shuttle in the city centre\nA boat shuttle on the Garonne riverThis network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology (APS), a new cable-free technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km (4.3 mi), while 8% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the Stade du Parc Lescure until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team, playing in Ligue 1 in the French football championship. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby.\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a 250 m (820 ft) wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== International relationship ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBordeaux wine regions\nBordeaux\u2013Paris, a former professional road bicycle racing\nThe Burdigalian Age of the Miocene Epoch is named for Bordeaux\nCanel\u00e9, a local pastry\nCommunes of the Gironde department\nDogue de Bordeaux, a breed of dog originally bred for dog fighting\nFrench wine\nList of mayors of Bordeaux\nOperation Frankton, a British Combined Operations raid on shipping in the harbour at Bordeaux, in December 1942, during World War II\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux\nGirondins\nAtlantic history\nTriangular trade\nHistory of slavery\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nChantal Callais and Thierry Jeanmonod (2019).

        "wiki": "CAPC mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux, formerly the Centre d'arts plastiques contemporains (CAPC), is a museum of modern art established in 1973 in Bordeaux, France.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe museum is housed in the Entrep\u00f4t Lain\u00e9, a former warehouse for colonial goods (sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, spices and oils) which were then re-exported to northern Europe by Bordeaux merchants.\nThe warehouse was built in 1824 by the architect Claude Deschamps, known for the construction of the Pont de pierre of Bordeaux. It is built of brick, stone and wood in a style inspired by italian architecture. \nThere are two grand naves that are reminiscent of the Roman basilicas and that are used to present temporary exhibitions.\nThe building was restored by the architects Denis Valode and Jean Pistre in the 1980s, the second project that this architectural team had undertaken. \nTheir treatment was unusual for the time, emphasizing shadows and depth.The designer Andr\u00e9e Putman renovated the interior.\nThe Caf\u00e9 Putman, named after the decorator, has a minimalist decor of metal, concrete and natural materials such as teak and wicker.\nIt has a terrace.Since 1981, the building also hosts Arc en r\u00eave centre d'architecture, association that organises exhibitions and knowledge exchange about architecture, urban development, landscape and design.\n\n\n== Centre d'arts plastiques contemporains ==\nIn 1965 Roger Lafosse created the Sigma Festival in Bordeaux, an avant-garde festival of visual and performance arts.\nIn 1973 he installed Sigma in the Entrep\u00f4t Lain\u00e9.\nThe Centre d'Arts Plastiques Contemporains (CAPC) was founded by Jean-Louis Froment.\nIn 1973 CAPC held its first contemporary art exhibition called Regarder ailleurs (Look Elsewhere).\nBy 1974 CAPC had moved into the warehouse.The first exhibitions included artists such as Gina Pane, Andy Warhol and Christian Boltanski. \nThey quickly established the venue as one of the leading places dedicated to contemporary visual arts.\nTwo theater companies joined Sigma and CAPC, as well as the architecture center Arc en r\u00eave.\nCAPC presented new avant-garde work in group exhibitions, and was gradually discovered by the public.\n\n\n== Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain ==\n\nIn 1983 the institution became the CAPC Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux (Bordeaux Museum of Contemporary Art).\nThe museum was formally opened on 17 May 1984.\nDuring the 1980s the museum put on many exhibitions and events, and also arranged exhibitions in California, Spain and then throughout Europe and Japan with the exhibition of the Sonnabend Collection.American artist Keith Haring had a major exhibition in the museum in 1985, creating a series of ten large paintings, The Ten Commandments, to fit exactly the nave of the museum building. The ten paintings are now part of the Keith Haring Foundations' collection and have been displayed on many other locations since. Haring did leave the museum a mural painting inside the elevator shaft.\nIn 1990 the CAPC Mus\u00e9e and the arc en r\u00eave architecture center occupied the entire warehouse, which was reopened after renovations in June 1990.\nIn the years that followed the museum has steadily added to its collection, with assistance from the state.\nThe focus was enlarged from Europe and North America to cover work from Asia, South America and emerging countries.\nIn 2003 the museum was designated a National Museum of France.The CAPC museum presents permanent exhibitions of its collection and organizes large temporary exhibitions on specific themes. \nIt often features artists who work in the Bordeaux region. Since 2000 the museum has frequently been used for exhibitions of music, architecture, cinema, literature or design, and has often put on exhibitions of popular art.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nJean-Louis Froment, 1973\u20131996\nHenry-Claude Cousseau, assisted by Marie-Laure Bernadac, 1997\u20132000\nMaurice Fr\u00e9churet, 2001\u20132006\nCharlotte Laubard, 2006-2013\nMar\u00eda In\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez 2014-2018\nSandrine Patron 2019-Current\n\n\n== Links ==\nCAPC-Bordaux website\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

The exhibitions are pretty eclectic and often towards the weirder end of modern art so you may or may not like them but they\u2019re always worth a look. But the building alone is worth the entry fee. A stunning conversion of this",

          "As in any museum of contemporary art not all the punters are going to be happy with what's on view! That's not the point- the point is to be challenged. Firstly the setting- what a fabulous building. Well adapted and will provide great space for the wide range it will cater for.",
          "If you want to see how it should be done, go to the Tate Modern, where they know how to integrate art and architecture. Seriously, trying to ignore the 'Emperor's clothes' cliche of modern art, the stuff in this building was tragically bad, and I have seen better student",
          "I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt because as an art student I love contemporary art which can often be hard to understand; but the work here really was bad. For such a huge building there was hardly any art on display and the things that were on display",
          "Upfront - I'm not a big fan of modern or contemporary art. This museum scrapes three stars basically for the building in which it is situated. The exhibits are sparsely distributed throughout the building and seem to me to offer little in the way of artistic or historical merit.",
          "The building is beautiful - an old warehouse for goods imported to Bordeaux from all over the world. It's interesting just to walk around. As part of the current festival to celebrate the new high speed train line, there's a brilliant exhibition on everything to do with",
          "The building was formerly a warehouse and it is interesting to see how it is constructed and how it is functioning as a museum of modern art. The quality of the exhibitions vary. It depends if you like it or not. It is very personal. We liked the exhibition about Landscaping! It",

          "As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is a really great building, but I can see how it could be confusing getting around. When we visited, there was no special exhibit on, so we were charged a concessionary rate of \u20ac4 (down from \u20ac7). We appreciated that they did this",
          "We were disappointed in this musuem. The space, in an old warehouse, is quite interesting but the vast internal area presents all kinds of lighting challenges as there are no windows. The exhibits were all temporary, with no evidence of a permanent collection that we could see.",
          "Firstly this museum is in a great space A converted warehouse built in 1824 just on the river front and converted in the 70's 80's and 90's into the functional space it is today. It is a creative workspace that utiles the spatial possibilities of the architecture. Spend a couple",
          "Strange place. We are open minded to modern art, but this was weird. I agree with others who've said the building is hard to navigate around, many areas seem shut off and/or dark, signage is terrible. Floor plans on each level just show a plan of the floor, no indication of what",

          "We have often enjoyed modern art museums but this one left us rather uncertain. I would guess that entry / price / experience might depend on what exhibitions are on. Unlike other reviews here we paid 6\u20ac to enter in early August. There were a range of exhibitions: perhaps 3",

          "Not only is the building difficult to find (even though there are multiple signs pointing to the general area its in), but it was also difficult to find any art in it once we were inside. And that's not an art critique... there was almost no art in the entire building.",
          "The museum was hard to find because we expected it to be in a new building. But the building was as interesting as the exhibit. We saw a temporary exhbit because they were between things upstairs, but it was very edgy and yet good. There was a nice cafe/coffee shop on the top."

          "The CAPC Museum of Contemporary Art is an extraordinary place for admirers of avant-garde art. In addition to the central architecture that resembles a medieval chapel, the exhibits that pass through there are wonderful. Great world artists \u2026",
          "Though in a building that could be spectacular - think Punta della Dogana in Venice - the contents weren't great, at least on this visit.  The ground floor area showed 'Navigation Charts', one of the main works for which Lubaina Himid was \u2026",
          "Kind staff and interesting building. Unfortunately not so much works in exhibition...loads of empty space...",
          "Free on the 1st Sunday of every month, except July and August. Blown away by the comics exhibitions upstairs (not sure if they\u2019re temporary). Absolutely loved walking around and enjoying the building itself, especially the terrace area.",
          "Beautiful rooftop for lunch. The exhibitions were not that worth at this time, but I believe we were unlucky!",
          "Very boring expositions, there were three and I only liked one partially. There isn\u2018t much explanation and if there is it\u2018s usually in French. The building is impressive but overall not worth the money.",
          "A wonderful contemporary art museum housed in a beautiful historic building. Easily reached by Tram B, 5 minutes from Place de la Bourse and the mirror pool, near the river. Back to the CAPC, friendly staff add to the warm atmosphere,  the exhibits are well laid out with several interactive exhibits. Go, visit, enjoy!",
          "Very interesting building, great expositions, superb atmosphere, free entry on sunday.",
          "A very interesting building to locate a museum. The museum was a deception. Some temporal exhibitions but few art own pieces. In general, we expected more interesting pieces and collections.",
          "More contemporary than modern for my liking. Just depends on what you like. But it isnt too big,  so worth a look if in the area",
          "I honestly wouldn't bother. Without a doubt the least interesting gallery/museum I have ever visited. Not worth the time or entrance fee. The 'art' was incredibly underwhelming and I found myself spending more time looking at the building \u2026",
          "3 stars only because I didn't love the exposition that was presented there at that time",
          "Very interesting modern art exhibition and interesting space",
          "I really like weird stuff, and this was seriously weird even for me! The building is stunning. It's a very large converted and renovated church - might even have been a cathedral. Artistically speaking, architecture is my thing, second only \u2026",
          "Beautiful historic building houses permanent and traveling exhibits. We saw Takako Saito's work spanning several decades - she is now 90 and still creating",
          "Didn't know what to expect, maybe because some clown gave it a one-star review. But I loved this place, the building itself providing a laid-back ambience. Particularly liked the exhibition by Japanese artist Takako Saito. Intricate, delicate, quirky and with a sense of fun, it was an absolute delight.",
          "great area.",
          "extraordinary space and exhibitions!",
          "The restored museum building is impressive. The huge basilica-like ground level hall beautifully set with the 'drive-in' presentation. The permanent exhibition on the top floor is interesting and appealing to a non-fan of contemporary art :)\nThe roof top is yet another powerful work of art strongly calling upon on collective memory.",
          "Striking rehab of an old warehouse offers vast open spaces and intimate all\u00e9es. The excerpts from the permanent collection were varied and interesting. It seems like a vibrant institution. We had a great time.",
          "Ignore the idiot who gave it 1 star. This place is cool. Nice outdoor space on the roof too.",
          "Building very beautiful but very disappointed by the exhibitions. The 'art' was incredibly underwhelming",
          "Modern museum in a warehouse setting. CAPC museum is easy to miss, it's main door and building facade almost wants to stay unnoticed. However when you enter you will be surprised by the huge volume inside with vaulted archways and dark \u2026",
          "A beautiful location with surprising modern art",
          "Resourceful place to go. Temporary exhibition are very often held there",
          "This is an contemporary art museum, the tourist such doing a little study before they visiting the exhibition here.",
          "I'm a fan of contemporary art, and I definitely loved this museum! We took our time wandering through and spent more time here than we thought we would. I found the pieces to be very relevant to current cultural and political events, and \u2026",
          "A must see for art lovers diverse and thought provoking",
          "Enjoyed the museum and exhibition of Takako Saito very much, great place",
          "Very nice building. Temporary exhibitions were ok (especially young architects in Latin America). Main exposition not too big.",
          "Great bulding, nae sure that i understood the exhibition by the japanese artist",
          "Extremely dark.  Not appropriate for children.  Very ghoulish.",
          "Former Bordeaux warehouse, which has been converted into a modern art museum.\nVery spacious location, multiple exhibitions, including space for children to play and explore.\nInteresting Restaurant on upper floor with access to a beautiful roof garden.",
          "CAPC Musee d'art contemporain de Bordeaux was Interesting. Calm and spacious. Contemporary arts are well flowed in the historic buildings. In particular, walking on the rooftop was the best because of its the unique architecture design and views. I wish I could visit again.",
          "Incredible center with very interesting expositions of architecture and contemporary art..aAn incredible experience!!!",
          "Interesting but for 7 euros its too expansive, I mean this is not even true art !",
          "Interesting building. Lovely caf\u00e9 on roof. Very interesting Chinese architecture exhibition when we were there. Not to much else on in there though.",
          "Great space but the display didn't move me as much as it could have.",
          "Great place to visit in Bordeux! You can find both something you can't fit into your head and what will make you observe it again and again from different angels. And awesome cosy opened terrace on the roof \u2013 impossible to pass away. Take some hours to visit exhibitions \u2013 it's totally worth it.",
          "It's good with varying exhibits. The building itself is worth seeing. Enjoyed the Chinese architecture exhibit.",
          "Sorry. We love art museums and especially contemporary art, but we failed to see any organization here. Mostly empty, cold exhibits. Maybe they were between shows.",
          "The building is a very interesting place, it cost \u20ac5pp to enter amd there were several exhibitions to view. There is a cafe on the roof to enjoy fine food and wine. The art itself was interesting, but obviously subjective.",
          "Very strange. Maybe you\u2019ll like it if you enjoy watching a woman rub a garlic clove all over her naked body while surrounded by knives and tomatoes, because that is the kind of thing you will see.",
          "Exceptional location and space. Working there at the library is such a nice experience",
          "Not great for accessibility for those with mobility problems.",
          "4 stars because the restaurant on top is too expensive for what they provide",
          "Got there and it was closed,  very disappointing.",
          "one of the most beautiful museums i have ever been to! it's pretty interesting to see all the new arts in such an ancient place, and there are indeed some very very good works. may not be good for little kids because some works can leave a \u2026",
          "Beautiful venue, great gift shop but fundamentally short of exciting contemporary art.",
          "Great galleries, beautiful building. Very helpful staff speak great English.\nFree entry on the first Sunday of each month.",
          "Very strange and unengaging \u201cart\u201d with the grumpiest and most unwelcoming staff I can recall. If you have children, stay away or they will treat you like you have some sort of plague. If you are hoping to have kids who never engage in art, this is the place for you.",
          "Magnificent old building that offers an outstanding exhibition space, but rooms and exhibits are not numbered so you don\u2019t know what you are looking at. Very poorly presented. Disappointing.",
          "Unique experience of modern art in classic warehouse location.  Great restaurant on the roof",
          "Amazing exhibition space with interesting temporary and permanent exhibits.  Don't miss the two Richard Long sculptures on the roof.",
          "The Chinese exhibition was interesting since it was architecture as opposed to modern art. However the other exhibitions were uninteresting and bland.",
          "fun engaging exhibits",
          "Excellent guided tour at 11:30. The elevator with the vertical  Keith Harring is worth a visit on its own. ",
          "loved it",
          "Interesting building, experience depends on the exhibitions.",
          "It's OK. We stopped by here as one of the things to see in Bordeaux. Interesting and unexpected layout where you discover pieces in the dark. Paid entry.",
          "Good art center, founded in 1973 by curator Jean-Louis Froment, with an innovative artistic program with major international art tendencies and curatorial programs",
          "Great exhibitions, very contemporary so be ready for some pretty weird exhibits",
          "Interesting place",

          "Amazing",
          "The worst museum I ever been to! Just a few pieces of modern installations, nothing extraordinary, such a huge place and not content at all. They also charge 4 euro for this. Such a disappointment.  AVOID.",

          "Very artsy",

          "A vast and exceptional place. The exhibition although being dismantled for certain parts is very extensive. Lots to see!\n\n",

          "Old storage building converted into a museum. The building is simply beautiful. The summer we can have a drink on you. The exhibitions are quite nice for contemporary art lovers.\n\n",
          "Superb place which alone justifies the visit, for exhibitions, everyone to form their opinion because they are very diverse. Very courteous staff.\n\n",
          "Museum of painting and contemporary work. Some works are very complicated to understand, the idea or the emotions that the painter wanted to transfer. Like this works with the cubes I do not understand it.\n\n",
          "Fantastic collection and place.\nToo bad the staff in charge of monitoring the rooms are not involved in the exhibitions ... No knowledge !!\n\n",

          "Pretty vske boring and primitive in my opinion. Maybe of course no luck with exposure\n\n",
          "For architecture enthusiasts, this place is magical for all creators and those looking for original ideas. We can love or hate, it all depends on your imagination. To see without hesitation, in an extraordinary place \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Pont de pierre, or \"Stone Bridge\" in English, is a bridge in Bordeaux, (in the Gironde department of France), which connects the left bank of the Garonne River (cours Victor Hugo) to the right bank quartier de la Bastide (Avenue Thiers).\nIt is 487 m (1,598 ft) in length and 19 m (62 ft) wide. It constitutes the legal frontier between the maritime domain and the river domain in the port of Bordeaux.\n\n\n== Name and translation ==\n\"Stone bridge\" is the usual translation of \"Pont de pierre\", however the real meaning of the french phrase \"pont de pierre\" is \"masson bridge\". As a matter of fact, the bridge is built mainly of brick and not stone.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nFirst bridge over the Garonne River at Bordeaux, the Pont de pierre was planned and designed during the First French Empire, under the orders of Napoleon I. As he campaigned in Spain, he needed his troops cross rapidly the river, and the original project envisaged a wood bridge, easier to build. Until then, it was necessary to cross the river by boat.\nDue to lack of resources, the construction took place subsequently, during the Bourbon Restoration, from 1819 to 1822. During these three years, the builders were faced with many challenges because of the strong current and the high tidal range, 6 m (20 ft), at that point in the river.  They used a diving bell borrowed from the British to stabilise the bridge's pillars.\n\nThe bridge has 17 arches (according to the legend the number of letters in the name 'Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte'). On the sides, each pile of bricks is capped by a white medallion that were to receive the cipher of Louis XVIII of France, a double L.\nIt was the only bridge until the construction of pont Saint-Jean in 1965.\n\nThe bridge and its tide is an important point in the Itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 Grand Gabarit, the logistic schedule transporting parts for the Airbus A380 production.Since 2016, the condition of the bridge makes it now permanently closed to traffic except for pedestrians, cyclists, trams and emergency vehicles.\n\n\n== Postage stamp ==\nOn 26 April 2004, a tourist stamp was issued for \u20ac0.50 in Bordeaux,.  It shows the bridge and a train Pierre tramway de Bordeaux inaugurated on 21 December 2003.  Contrary to what the stamp shows, the tram passes along the bridge and not on a second bridge alongside. The design is the work of Claude Andr\u00e9otto, engraved by Claude Jumelet for printing intaglio. The stamp was withdrawn from sale on 12 November 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Gironde\nStation Porte de Bourgogne (Tram de Bordeaux) (left bank) and Station Stalingrad (Tram de Bordeaux) (right bank)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLe pont de pierre sur Google Maps",

          "We fell in love with the aptly named Pont de Pierre. Not only is it a beautiful stone bridge, it offers a wide variety of views on the Garonne river and its banks both during the day and at night. It is well worth crossing the bridge (on foot or by tram) to Bastide on the right",
          "We cycled over this bridge on our Bordeaux Bike Experience tour. It was worth doing because you get a good view of the waterfront buildings. Allegedly the 17 arches correspond to the number of letters in NAPOLEON BONAPARTE and his Imperial wreath is set between each. Sadly he",
          "Beautiful to watch the small boats go 7nder this old Riman bridge. There are green areas on the both rides of the bridge. Our driver stopped for a photo break fir us.",
          "Great place to take photos from. The bridge is a fantastic structure. You can see the city from so many different angles. My favourite bridge in Bordeaux. When you walk over it you are not far from Darwin another must see.",
          "The river is a key point to draw your attention as you are coming into the city from the south. Although the skyline of the city is low, it still very attractive. As you get into the city, the bridge is easy to spot on the river to the right. This was one of the first",
          "This is literally meaning of French name. Old bridge constructed between 1819 and 1822. It has 17 arches and white medallions are placed on the sides in honour of Napoleon Bonaparte. Until 1965 it was the only bridge in Bordeuax.",

          "Old and full of history, this bridge. Spans across the water reflecting beautifully. Many people jog or stroll by the water.",
          "I have to be honest we didn't cross the bridge. We just took photos from the main esplanade. But what a great piece of Roman history.",
          "Compared to its near neighbours, the more modern bridges, this one has style and a certain elegance. A walk across gives nice views of the city waterfront - and it's almost traffic free (beware the cyclists, the skateboarders, the electric scooters and the trams!)",
          "Lovely old bridge with lots of history. From the bridge you are able to get beautiful photos of downtown Bordeaux as well.",

          "This is a beautiful bridge but the best time to take photos and cross it is at dusk. The light is magnificent and it has such presence! Worth checking!",

          "The best of the bridge happens at night when its lighting it on and give it a very romantic appearance",
          "Bordeaux has two iconic images: the Place de la Bourse city square and the old stone bridge. For history and beauty, we prefer the 200 year-old Ponte de Pierre because, like the Statue of Liberty in New York, it must have been the first image of Bordeaux to weary travelers who",
          "In 3 more years, it will be 200 years old! And it really does look it. The bridge is so beautiful and its 17 arches spanning the river correspond to the number of letters in Napoleon Bonaparte's name (think that was by mistake?) Look at the pilings at the base of the bridge",
          "While walking around Bordeaux, we stopped by and visited this bridge. Pedestrians can also walk on it. It does get hot during the afternoon when there is no shade.",
          "Walking over this very old bridge offers great views of the lovely city of Bordeaux Beware of cyclists and trams! Look down and see the currents in the river and watch for the changing colours as the tide comes and goes out",
          "Our recent trip on September 12th led to great frustration in attempting to cross the river In Bordeaux to find our hotel. Two G P S systems and a map did not indicate that the Pont de Pierre bridge is closed to cars- only trams, bicycles and E R vehicles are allowed! No signs",
          "Great old stone bridge over Garonne river, the oldest one in town. Now closed to traffic, except trams, busses, bicycles and pedestrians. Very nice view of the quais.",
          "We walked across this bridge to Stalingrad and got the ferry back. A beautiful bridge with nice views back to Place de la Bourse",
          "This bridge is classy. Saw it from the city tour bus and it was just beautiful. You can see it from the banks it\u2019s even more majestic day or night.",
          "Ordered by Napolean but not completed in his lifetime. Fantastic bridge to walk across with 17 arches and fabulous looking lamp posts. Very relaxing to walk across and back and enjoy the views. Pretty at night with lights on.",
          "Beautiful view of Bordeaux. Old bridge with fabulous light post. A quiet walk across the bridge was very relaxing after a full day.",
          "If you visit Bordeaux then you will naturally see the bridge connecting the two sides of the city across the river. The river was ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte but infortunately couldnot be contructed during his lifetime but there are 17 arches which are equiavalent to 17letters",
          "A beautiful sight and should be viewed at different times of the day. It is especially beautiful in the setting sun which naturally highlights the red colour of the bridge. Be sure to walk across and view the city from the other side. Some nice places to eat here too. Nice",
          "Supposedly there is a coach that was left inside during the building of it. No tours to be had in what are supposed to be workers's tunnels inside of the bridge.",
          "Do the walk. The city views are fantastic! You will get an appreciation for what this port has meant to the world by just analyzing the arquitectura of it's buildings from this vantage point.",
          "This beautiful bridge from the beginning of 19 cent was built upon this famous emperor orders. It was the first bridge in Bordeaux to span the Garrone river. Namely, the 17 beautiful arches on which it rests represent 17 letters of France's emperor. The bridge connects the Old",
          "Iconic bridge across the Gironde in central Bordeaux - stylish old bridge, typical of the region. Great for taking photos westwards across the river to the city landmarks and spectacular if done at sunset.",
          "Lots of traffic and people. Police were in the area, not sure I would want to be there late at night",
          "Quite a walk across this bridge and a stop for a coffee on the other side is most welcome. Apparently its 19 arches are said to represent the 19 letters of Napoleon's name.",
          "Although the bridge is quite literally just a means to the outer city, it does give good views over to both sides of the city. And I am obsessed with beautiful lampposts so that was a nice find.",
          "Pont de Pierre is a famous bridge that links up two sides of the city. As an experiment, only pedestrains and bikers are allowed to cross the bridge( sight-seeing buses on certain time of the day ) It is a low bridge and thus no cruise ships can sail underneath this bridge.",
          "Not much to say about or do at this feature. In another city it would not be on the tripadvisor list of features. Its nice ok and it forms part of the overall waterfront area but thats it.",
          "We enjoyed the spectacular view of the bridge at night from our river cruise ship. Because the river was flowing high, our ship could not sail under.",
          "The famous pont de Pierre is connecting Bordeaux\u2019s right bank to the left bank between esplanade and Sainte-Marie-de-la-Bastide church. The construction of this famous bridge was commissioned by Napoleon and ended in 1822. Napoleon demanded that many arch under the bridge",
          "This magnificent bridge is currently the subject of a traffic experiment that excludes cars and lorries -- thus it is a much nicer place to walk and view the city.",
          "We e crossed the Pont de Pierre\u2019s few times now, once on foot, twice on a bike! It\u2019s just fantastic to see the forward-thinking of Bordeaux! No cars! And so many people crossing g! Just goes to show, an environmentally-conscious city can make changes for the better of all of us!",
          "We were on a bike tour over Napoleons bridge and for some reason there were no cars only people and bikes. I've seen some reviews that said there were cars but our guide said they were not allowed. Maybe it was the time of day but I thought he meant all the time. Anyway there",
          "Once you see and walk over it, you will know why this bridge is the definitive postcard picture....just lovely!",
          "Long bridge with great lightning and historical structure. Many sights if you have energy to walk around the whole bridge. Nice views",
          "Beautiful in the day time and even more so at night with all the light reflected on the water. Twice I have been here and my admiration for it has not diminished. I wonder how many people have proposed within sight of this beautiful bridge?",
          "Great walk at sunset, when you can see the city buildings light up and the lights on the bridge come on.",
          "... works well for Instagram pics :) try to go there in early mornings to avoid a heavy load of tourists in your shots. also very beautifully lighted up at night",
          "What a bridge, looks great from a distance, then sit in its lee before walking over, great way to while away an hour or two!",
          "This bridge crosses the Garonne River, connecting Cours Victor Hugo with Avenue Thiers. Constructed in the early 1800\u2019s it is still used today by pedestrians, autos and trams. Between each arch is a medallion and at night is lit up from lights on each pier footing.",
          "Pont de pierre (stone bridge) we walked on it at night and had a bus tour which had interesting information about the bridge. Great for pictures, a must see.",
          "Very impressive old structure which is in great condition and looks beautiful at night all lite up. You can walk, drive or take a tram over it.",
          "a nice view over the river Garonne and the bridge from the riverside, even if it is not really worth crossing the bridge, enjoy the view and move on.",
          "I love the fact private vehicles are not allowed on this bridge. Taxis, buses and walkers/ cyclists are allowed. It\u2019s a fine wide bridge and gives a wonderful panorama of the Bordeaux city skyline.",
          "Since August2017, le Pont de Pierre, built in 1820, is allowed only for pedestrians, bikers and public transportation. Wether people like it or not, the place is far more quieter compared to the the time of traffic jams. You can now enjoy, far more quietly, the views over",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed viewing and walking over the bridge. Not too crowded, streets were clean. Many people walking, biking, jogging. Beautiful to see from a distance, though does not photograph well in my experience.",
          "One of the nicest bridges I've set eyes on. I think it's now just for pedestrian usage. Well worth a look.",
          "Well worth a walk over this bridge to admire the view and the contruction of the bridge. Pleasantly free of traffic apart from the trams and bicycles.",
          "This is my wife's favourite bridge a lovely aspect at night with lovely lamps illuminating the bridge which sweeps over the Garonne. Beautiful.",
          "Had a walk there in the late afternoon. Beautiful bridge with great view of Bordeaux city. The day was bright n clear, took some good pics",
          "Had lunch with a large group just below the bridge, with a view. It connects the new with the old side of Bordeaux. Both are worth visiting.",
          "It is a tourist attraction from the history point of view. Otherwise...just a place to feel the breeze on a sunny day.",
          "A beautiful bridge built by Napoleon. I was told that the two styles of lamps (alternating facing upward and downward from the pole) were chosen because the people voted 50% for each option.",
          "The name seems a bit boring, stone bridge, but the design is lovely. I read that the 17 arches reflect the number of letters in Napoleon Bonaparte's name. But that's not the purpose of my review. In addition to the wonderful tramway they have in Bordeaux, there is also a boat",
          "A lovely, photogenic bridge, with arches over the Garonne River, and picturesque lampstandards, planned by Napoleon I, and built during the Bourbon Restorations, 1819 to 1822. There are bars and restaurants on both sides of the river and the walk alongside the river is an",
          "Took a bike ride over the bridge, very nioce. There is plenty of space to walk, ride or drive a vehicle over it.",
          "This bridge reminds the one in Praga. It's a pleasure walk through full of people running \ud83c\udfc3 and walking \ud83d\udeb6, and typical trams.",
          "The Pont de Pierre (stone bridge) must be the oldest bridge spanning the Garonne in the city, a long series of low arches with ornate 'Victorian' lamp standards. Now the main traffic across the bridge is trams, busses and cycles. See it from the main promenade by the Place de la",
          "It's very easy to walk across to get photos looking back on the old part of town. Also, look down and see if the water is going in or out. When the water is going out to sea it is muddy and churning. When it is coming back in from the sea it is blue and looks completely",
          "Very hard to miss the stone bridge while visiting Bordeaux. It links the upmarket side of the river with the... less upmarket but honest working class Bastide area. A fine bridge and worth a stroll then go further across Place Stalingrad and have a look at the grassed tram",
          "A contrast to the modern bridge further up river. Many arches that are of some interest but not spectacular.",
          "Not particulary pretty but it is a pleasant walk and the views are quite nice, especially at night. I especially love the ornate lamp posts. The tram runs along the centre which limits car traffic.....but watch out for cyclists! They can be self absorbed and dangerous,",
          "If you take one of the Trams it crosses the Garonne River via Pont de Pierre so you get to see the bridge up close and better you get the view from the bridge which was nice.",
          "A long bridge crossing the Garonne in Bordeaux, near the Porte de Bourgogne and Porte Calihou. It is a good place to photograph the river and Bordeaux buildings looking downstream. It has tramlines in the centre of the bridge that reduces road traffic to a single lane each way,",
          "Its a bridge over the river. It has some interesting historical facts, built on the orders of Napoleon, difficulties spanning the river, but unless youre interested in Brides or Architecture its simply what it is. Incidentally, if you're in Bordeau & down by the waterfront,",
          "This old bridge is a focal point of Bordeaux across the dividing river of the city is most photographed by all the visitors to this architectural city Have a stop and take a few pictures of the lovely structure",
          "Beautiful but nothing spectacular. It`s pretty long so and you can get some nice views of the river and waterfront.",
          "As bridges go this is a very nice one and definitively worth crossing. The views over the city are beautiful and the Garonne river is impressive to say the least. After crossing to east side, have a look at the blue lion of Stalingrad and take the ferry back to Quinconces.",
          "17 arches for Napoleon, beautiful lamps and you can cross by bike, foot, tram or car - how very civilised. Great views of the riverfront and the mighty Garonne.",
          "We enjoyed walking across the stone bridge. The water level changed as apparently the river is a tidal river.",
          "Nice views of the old town and the Garonne, but the bridge itself even at night is still a bridge. Paris, London or Rouen All have more impressive architectural or engineering structures, nice but not breathtaking. Look downstream for a dramatic example.",
          "If, like me, you like bridges this is a great one to walk across. The beautiful Stone Bridge, the first of its type in Bordeaux and maybe France, straddles the Garonne River. It was commissioned by Napoleon and inaugurated in 1822. The water below is muddy, choppy and",
          "Iconic bridge over the Garonne. Easy to find with good promenades on both banks. Well worth a walk up either side for a great view of the river and the city.",
          "This may well be my favourite bridge anywhere. It spans the wide, turbid and deceptively rapid Garonne close to the centre of the city. It is both long and broad and its graceful arch appears quite low over the racing water. The contrasting honey-tinted limestone and terracotta",
          "While the bridge provides interest and excellent views from a crossing on foot it is from being on the river itself that the views excel. The lengthy river cruise ships can only pass through at slack tide and the passage has an edge due to this consideration. At night the bridge",
          "Saw this bridge in almost all photos depicting Bordeaux. Had high expectations which were not really met. I have appreciated bridges in some other cities like in Budapest, London, Prague but for some reasons, this bridge did not give me the same amazed feeling when I saw it,",
          "Be warned, this is a very long bridge but well worth walking. The view of both sides of the city during the walk makes it well worthwhile.",
          "Iconic view of Bordeaux, from the bridge or the water - tram across, run across, walk or cycle - you choose but don't miss it, especially at night.",
          "This is a must see. It was built by Napolean and it is said to have treasure hidden inside it. Great to see by Canoes.",
          "This bridge has 17 arches - the number of characters in Napoleon Bonaparte's name. Info from our knowledge bus driver/guide. Untill this bridge was completed the only way to cross the river was by boat. Took ages to move an army!",
          "This bridge looks magnificent as it stretches its arches along the Garonne River, running through Bordeaux. A picture is worthwhile. I would recommend pictures of the arches from the riverbank, then cross the bridge and enjoy the views combining this fast flowing river and the",
          "A night time stroll or drive over the bridge gives the traveler a photo op view of the historical lighting that covers this bridge",
          "Good place to take a nice walk and look back on the city. The bridge itself is lovely. Check out it's history. It was very difficult to build this bridge because of the rough waters here.",
          "A lovely bridge.Nice to walk over but can get a tram over too.Like the lights along the bridge and looks lovely lit up at night.",
          "You are bound to see this bridge if you are on the riverbank near all the other main attractions in central Bordeaux. As far a bridges go it is a fine looking specimen!",
          "We had beautiful spring weather in Bordeaux and it was a great walk to the other side of the Garonne to see the beautiful architecture of Bordeaux",
          "Interesting 17 arches for the letters of Napoleon Bonnepart name. Great historic place to visit and it's hollow too.",
          "The highlight of our evening walks by the river Garonne. The lights of the bridge are magical.Also worth walking to the other side and have a look at the city center across the river.",
          "Beautiful old stone bridge bridge. The Belem 3 masted schooner is .currently moored next to the bridge which makes for lovely combined photos.",
          "This is a beautiful bridge based on and as beautiful as the bridges that cross the Seine in Paris. It can be crossed on foot, by tram, by bus or car.",
          "One of the most beautiful french bridge. It is worth crossing from the left bank to the right bank. The view of Bordeaux day or night is worth the little trip.",
          "Pont de Pierre (Stone Bridge in English) is a picturesque bridge with attractive lamps. It is one of the iconic sights of Bordeaux. It has 17 arches and was built in the 1820s and is about 487 metres long. The Garonne is a fast flowing river - what a feat of engineering",
          "This is the oldest bridge in Bordeaux which crosses the Garonne River, connecting Place de Stalingrad to the old city gate in Place Bir Hakeim. It is easy to walk across, cycle or even take the tram. It has many elegant arches and has traditional but beautiful lamps all along",
          "Had a nice night stroll through the bridge. It was quite a cold night but certainly worth it. Check it out!",
          "Enjoy a bicycle ride over beautiful bridge. Stop to look up the river towards Citi du Vin and Le Pont Jacques and back towards Place de la Bourse (Place Royale).",
          "The perfect location to take pictures of the w\u00e1ter mirror area. You can cross it on foot or by tram.",
          "There are several ways to cross the bridge, and each one interesting and exciting. The view at night is spectacular.",
          "There are a lot of interesting places to walk in Bordeaux, and this is one of them, also gives a good view of the estuary",
          "The bridge is beautiful especially at night with all the lights as you don't see the muddy Garonne underneath. A good point of view is the Mirror fountain.",
          "The Pont de Pierre is very useful for keeping the traffic circulating and is more architecturally attractive than many similar ones. However, it is only at night when it is illuminated that it comes into its own",
          "It is well worth walking across the Pont de Pierre to get a great view of Bordeaux (including the Place de la Bourse), and when you get to the other side the view is even more expansive. This stone arched bridge, built by Napoleon Bonaparte, stretches 487 m over the Garonne",
          "A walk across the bridge gives you the opportunity for a spectacular view of the city from the opposite site. This experience worth even the day or the night.",
          "A beautiful bridge at both night and day...commonly referred to as the Stone Bridge...do take a walk across the river, great views",
          "This is an iconic and historic bridge. worth walking across for the views and to access the less trodden right bank.",
          "On a river cruise, we could only get through the bridge to visit Cadillac at very low tides. It was fun to see the approach through one of the narrow arches, with just a foot or two to spare on the sides. We had ridden bikes across earlier--there is a nice bike trail that goes",
          "Beautiful view of the old city of Bordeaux. Reminds me of bridges in Paris.Good Bistros nearby in the old city.Especially beautiful at night when it is illuminated.",
          "Lovely bridge to look at. Built during the Napoleonic era, it presents a nice highlight to views of the Garonne.",
          "Wonderful views of the city, especially at night. Take the tram across the bridge and then walk back over it when everything is lit up.",
          "This Bridge was started under Napoleon and is still used today. It does present a problem for most boats because they need to wait for low tide to have sufficient room to pass under it. It is very pretty and looks very much at home in that location.",
          "The first and most beautiful bridge over the Garonne River in Bordeaux, planned and designed under Napoleon Bonaparte--its seven arches represent the number of letters in his name. I especially like the two different looks of lanterns and how they alternate. Not necessarily an",
          "We decided to have a walk over the bridge as we had just eaten along the river front, it was very well lit and also supprisingly romantic.",
          "So easy to get here from the UK. Great place with lots of English history attached to it. Beautiful old part of town. Lovely river front. Not to mention some stunning wine and vineyards just down the road. A visit to the old town of St Emilion is a must!",
          "It's just a bridge. It's visible from water mirror and palace de la bourse. Nothing very spectacular.",
          "There is not an awful lot to say about this structure, it is not the most beautiful bridge but the lighting is worth seeing.",
          "The principal asset of the bridge is that it is on the Gironde.It is not worth going just for the bridge.I took a walk under it and nothing to it",
          "It's pretty at night if you happen to be passing, but it is just a bridge. Not worth going out of the way for.",
          "We walked over the bridge to take photos from the other side. It's very pretty and I can see why it is so well known, but, at the end of the day, it is still only a bridge.",
          "Long, old bridge, nothing special only nice lanterns. Good locations nearby palace. If you have too much time you can visit that place.",
          "Yes its true. 17 arches ... just as many letters as in the Emperor's name. Vuilt as part of a Napoleonic attack plan on Spain but finished too late to be strategically useful. But a nice bridge. At low tide aiplane parts pass under one central arch (only). Look for the red light",
          "It is very nice at night with the lights. Don't go at noon because it'll be hot like an oven. You can bike through in the evenings. It is nice place to take a walk. You can do picnic nearby",
          "The Pont de Pierre (or 'Stone Bridge') is a historic bridge that spans the River Garonne. With its many arches, as well as iron lampposts, it is an impressive bridge. A quick photo stop.",
          "theres a pub accross the river called the central bar - go one evening grab a table outside, order some food and a bottle of wine and watch the city light up!! well worth it",
          "As I wrote in a previous review, check this bridge out at night when you are walking along Place du Bourse. The whole scene of the bridge, Place du Bourse, the water mirror, the people, and Pnt de Pierre is an extremely pleasnt experience.",
          "Wouldn't get to caught up in the history unlike the previous reviewer, unless your REALLY into bridges. This is nice, better than nice, but most things in Bordeaux are and to my mind you may as well stay on the city side because there isn't much happening over there.",
          "a 15 minute walk from Ibis central hotel across this bridge takes you straight into the town. Bordeaux has superb architecture, although the streets are a little run down",
          "Living in Paris with pretty much a bridge or passerelle every 100m I am astonished that the Pont de Pierre was until 1965 the only bridge traversing the Garonne in Bordeaux. It is very beautiful indeed with its 17 arches and street lights. It took 12 years from 1810 to 1822 to",
          "The Pont de pierre, called Stone Bridge is a bridge that connects the left bank of the Garonne to the right bank quartier de la Bastid.",
          "One of the nicest bridges in Bordeaux. It is lovely during the day and wonderful in the dark. It is worth having a long walk over it and the views are really amazing. This \"Stone Bridge\" was built in the early 1800s. Apparently the building of the bridge proved quite challenging",
          "amazing the way these bridges are built and the river currents moving this is a super place for a stroll and photo ops on the side of bastide neighborhood, the other side of the bridge that isnt so nice user friendly",
          "Every bit as impressive as picture in guide books. A must see. Built by Napoleon. 17 arches! The ornate street lamps are worth the visit alone.",
          "The light fixtures are what makes this bridge. They are a wonderful design and look good during the day as well as night time.",
          "When we walked by this bridge during the day, we didn't think much of it. It's just another European bridge. Nothing special. When we were taking photos of Le Miroir d'eau at night, we also captured a nice shot of this bridge. You don't necessarily need a special camera. The",
          "This is a beautiful bridge but not really useable like the ones in Paris as it is too long and not really close to the centre. It is particularly beautiful at night however it's lights are not comparable to the ones in Paris.",
          "Great to stretch across to the right bank. This area is becoming more developed. Some nice restaurants over here",
          "Maybe I have been spoiled by seeing some of the great bridges of the world but this bridge is neither particularly ornate or interesting. We cycled across it to get to Darwin and it did not stand out or strike me as being particularly interesting - I wouldn't go out of my way to",
          "beautiful bridge with as many arches as Napoleons name looks very nice at night when light up take the tram and go to Stalingrad to get boat to travel on the Garonne",
          "The bridge in quite attractive and is easy to walk. We especially liked the bridge in the evening as the lights on the bridge make it very picturesque. As an important landmark of the city you should not miss visiting it.",
          "So, it's a bridge. It's worth a look because it is beautiful (especially in profile) and usefully connects Bordeaux with Stalingrad. Used by people, cyclists (who are NOT people in my opinion) cars and trams. Walk across, stare at the sinister muddy waters as the tide turns.",
          "In my opinion there is nothing wrong with visiting that bridge.. but it is not that interesting and you see already the most of it if you go to the Place de la bourse.",
          "This bridge was started to be built by Napoleon's order and is a landmark of the city serving the main traffic between each sides of Garonne.",
          "It's a nice historical bridge, made better by it's history. We were told Napoleon was not happy that there was no bridge for his troops to cross. So he had the bridge built. The the bridge has 8 arches, which coincides with the number of letters in Napoleon's",
          "This is the oldest bridge over the River Garonne in Bordeaux and is an impressive structure for something built in 1822. The ironwork in the lamp posts is ornate and well done and the bridge looks especially good when lit by the sun.",
          "The bridge offers a good view across Bordeaux and is an enjoyable walk. River is tidal and flows quickly both ways",
          "Built in 1906 across the Garonne River it linked a vital part of the Bordeaux countryside with the city. All the features, including iron work is very well executed!",
          "Very interesting structure the has a lot of activity from pedestrians and cyclists as well as vehicles",
          "this bridge is picture perfect specially when you capture it at night and the moon is on its full moon state. this is near the water mirror.",
          "about 300mts in length but on the other side passed the recycing plant,there is a lovely park area leading to the next bridge.",
          "Handy for getting from one side of a river to the other, this sight is better seen in profile as one walks the promenade eating ice cream than from above while walking across it. Check it out from side on. Anything else is just checklist tourism.",
          "I walked across the bridge on a cloudy day. The return trip walking back towards Place de la Bourse was particularly romantic. The buildings all along the river were 18th-19th century-styled. You can easily imagine without the cars, the view looked exactly like 2 centuries ago",
          "Amazingly 500 metres long, but a lovely walk to venture into the Right Bank. This symbol of the city built by Napoleon was for a long time the only crossing before the badly needed three others (all during my residence here! ) Hope the addition of the (fabulous) tram line does",
          "I walked across the bridge. I took a tram. I had no bicycle or car, but those folks were crossing as well. And underneath, the Garonne River flowed, and from the bridge we could see the little boat that is part of the public transportation system cross from the Rive Gauch to the",
          "This was the first bridge built over the Garonne River that has very raging currents. Under the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte it was designed and then constructed between 1819 -1822. The 17 arches are supposedly for the letters in the name Napoleon Bonaparte. Three intertwined",
          "We wanted to have a quick look at the other side of the river and this was a fun way to make the trip.",

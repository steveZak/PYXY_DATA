        "wiki": "Liseberg is an amusement park located in Gothenburg, Sweden, that opened in 1923. It is the most visited amusement park in Scandinavia, attracting about three million visitors annually.  Among the noteworthy attractions is the wooden roller coaster Balder, twice (2003 and 2005) voted as the Best Wooden Tracked Roller Coaster in the world in a major international poll. The park itself has also been chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes magazine.Additional to the summer season, the park is also open during November and December, albeit with fewer rides operating, hosting a Halloween season with various house of horrors and a Christmas market with traditional Swedish cuisine such as mulled wine and specialties such as d\u00f6ner kebab made from  reindeer meat.\nThe official colors of Liseberg are pink and green as can be seen on the entrance and the older houses in the park, the colors were also adopted for the logo, which was introduced in the 1980s, but changed in 2013 to the current logo.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1752, the landowner Johan Anders Lamberg named his property Lisas berg (\"Lisa's Mountain\") after his wife Elisabeth S\u00f6derberg. The area eventually became known as Liseberg.\nIn 1908, Gothenburg City bought the property, including the on-site buildings, for 225,000 Swedish kronor.\nIn 1923, Gothenburg celebrated its 300-year anniversary with the Gothenburg Exhibition, which included a Leisure Park and the Congress Park; the area was opened on 8 May and included fun slides and the 980 ft long wooden Kanneworffska Funicular, designed by the Danish amusement builder Waldemar Lebech (originally there were 5 trains with 3 cars each that accommodated 10 people in each car, the ride lasted 2 and half minute; the ride was demolished in 1987 after having served over 41 million visitors). The fun park was originally intended as a temporary attraction for the Exhibition, but it became such a success with over 800,000 visitors in just over a month, that it was kept open. With an area of 1,500,000 m\u00b2 the park had cost 2.6 million kronors to build.\nOn 24 November 1924, the Gothenburg City Council decided to purchase the Liseberg amusement park for 1 million kronors. In 1925, the amusement park was taken over by the municipal company Liseberg AB. The park's first director and one of its initiators was the legendary \"carpenter from Sk\u00e5ne\" Herman Lindholm, who managed it 1923\u201342.\nOn 13 August 1935, the functional-inspired Liseberg Bath was inaugurated, created by engineer KI Sch\u00f6n Anderson. The pool was 15 meters wide and 36 meters long and sported underwater Lights and artificial waves. The Pool was able to receive 800 people at a time, entrance fee with a cabin was 50 cents. The Swedish Olympic hopeful champion from 1920, Arvid Wallman, inaugurated the facilities. The pool was closed in 1956 and the building was demolished in 1962 for the forthcoming 40th anniversary in 1963.\n\nRotundan was one of the largest dancehalls when it opened on 10 January 1940. Its architect was Axel Jonson, and the construction lasted for one year at a cost of approximately 500,000 SEK. The dance floor held 1,200 persons and on the second floor a bar with the name Uggleklubben was opened. In 1956, the facility was renovated and its name changed to the Rondo. The architect Gunnar Aspe was behind the work, which cost 1 million dollars.\nIn 1947, Liseberg AB opened hotel facilities; Hotell Liseberg Heden. Right from the start one of the objectives of Liseberg was that it would be an opportunity for Gothenburg dwellers to experience recreation and the scenery, and in 1959 it opened the Princess Birgitta, a flower exhibition. During the opening ceremony, 15,000 roses were strewn over the park by helicopter. In 1977, Honor Place was founded, a collection of many of the world's largest celebrity hand impressions. At the time, there were 50 imprints; today, there are more than can fit the area, so an annual selection is made as to who should get the honor to appear.\nIn 1991, the Liseberg Guest AB was formed to oversee the running of Gothenburg campsites and harbor. In the 1990s the park was expanded by 35 000 square meters and a host of new attractions was inaugurated. In 2015 Lisebergs different companies consolidated into one: Liseberg AB.\n\n\n== The park ==\nIn addition to the park's more than 30 different rides, Liseberg has many venues (stages, dance hall, restaurants and arcade halls). The park has two entrances / exits (one at \u00d6rgrytev\u00e4gen, the other at Getebergsled). Much of the park is forested.\nIn 1983, the green-pink bunny, Liseberg Rabbit, became the park's symbol and mascot.\nIn 1998, That year's Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar N\u00e4r karusellerna sover was filmed there.\nThe park is noted for its Lisebergs Lustgarten (botanical garden) that is landscaped and has many waterfalls, artworks and a variety of plants.\nLiseberg Main Stage (Stora Scenen) was built in 1923 and was originally designed as a big music pavilion for the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and other large-scale concerts (over the years the design of the venue has been modified). Bands such as Abba and the Rolling Stones have performed here. Right next to the Stora Scenen is the smaller Kvarnteatern which plays host to various smaller events, in particular children's theater.\nPolka (Polketten) is the dance hall that was built in 1925 but has since been moved to its current location. The Taube Scene was inaugurated in 2008 and is named after Evert Taube; this venue is used for different types of music such as jazz, and the Liseberg Orchestra plays here as well.\nAdjacent to Liseberg Park are more venues: Lisebergshallen is an entertainment and sports arena, home to the local floorball team and team handball team. Rondo is the name of a show venue and Liseberg Theater is a local theater.\nMultifarious Swedish performers have performed at Liseberg since its opening. Among them, Zarah Leander, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Evert Taube, ABBA, Lasse Dahlquist, Birgit Nilsson, Pernilla Wahlgren and Carola H\u00e4ggkvist. Sten-\u00c5ke Cederh\u00f6k played in 25 years' own perceptions of the \u201cWeek Revy\u201d. Other artists like Sonya Hedenbratt, Hagge Geigert and Laila Westersund have appeared countless times at Liseberg. Olof Palme gave a speech on the main stage during his last election in 1985.\nInternational acts who have performed at Liseberg include Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Cliff Richard, Nightwish, Delta Rhythm Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cat Stevens, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, The Who, PJ Proby, Frank Zappa with The Mothers of Invention, Bill Haley & His Comets, Procol Harum, and Toto, among others.\nSince 2004 a sing-along show called Lotta p\u00e5 Liseberg (Lotta at Liseberg), hosted by Lotta Engberg, is held every summer at Stora scenen in Liseberg, which airs over TV4 since 2009.\n\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n\n\n=== Water rides ===\nFlumeRide \u2013 a 630 m log flume ride that has 2 drops, the higher of which is 14 m (opened in 1973).

          "Great amusement park, must go place. You can enjoy there the entire day, plus they have some good rides, although the waiting time is high during peak season like Halloween, Christmas and Summer break.\nI must say, Halloween and Christmas \u2026",
          "Went there during Christmas. Looked beautiful with all decorations. Rides were awesome. Kids loved it too..",
          "If you want a true Christmas feel then this is the place to be. We were just mesmerized by the experience. Christmas market at its best.\n\nThe view from the hill top was even better.\nAs a family we enjoyed our evening there.\nThe park is \u2026",
          "A very fun place. All you need is contained in a relatively small area. We were here during Halloween, and it was really atmospheric. The  smoke, the pumpkins, the dressed up actors... the haunted houses were quite spooky, but not as spooky as the roller coasters! A very enjoyable experience.",
          "An amusement park that try a little extra.",
          "What an amazing fabulous place!!! Went over in December where it gets converted to a winter wonderland and was outstanding!! Everything is decorated to perfection as you can see!! Countless stalls selling traditional sweets, traditional \u2026",
          "Visit every halloween, and every year I love the place even more\u2764\ufe0f",
          "One of the most beautiful sights in Gothenburg. The Christmas theme is truly breathtaking. We enjoyed the sights, the music, games, snacks, and the Christmas carol ice-skating performance. The temperature is really low in there so, dress warmly. If you still feel very cold, find your way to one of the several fire places.",
          "It's an Amusement Park at Liseberg, Gotenborg, Sweden. This Park is closed in winter season. Children, young and old of all walk of life, come and enjoy to maximum. But it is very costly from entrance, eat, enjoyment and exit.",
          "1.40 hours in line, smokers, no water,loud. Basically only accessible for neurotypicals. But it's still fun so there's that. They should ban smoking tho",
          "Amazing amusement park in the heart of the city. Ice skating skit was amazing. Christmas celebrations were exciting. Will visit in summer again to enjoy all the rides.",
          "Great park, but why do the security guards behave like they are handling hooligans in a football match. No smiles to the kids, loud voices to visitors. Their behavior is old fashioned even in a military camp.",
          "Fun time with the family. Very beautiful during the christmas festival. My son loved the medieval/viking section.",
          "Only visited on the summer until now. The amusement park itself is great and the best in Sweden. During winter/Christmas season a lot is still open even if you miss some of the best rides. The Christmas theme is all over with tons of lights, Christmas trees \ud83c\udf84, nut crackers, snow \u2744\ufe0f(fake right now) etc.",
          "Stunning over Christmas! I wandered around in amazement at how beautifully decorated the park was. I loved it.",
          "Good place to chill with family. You will love it more if you have kids as there are lot activities for kids, rides and games.\nXmas lighting is beautiful.\nRecommended ride: valkary (or some similar name. Not sure about exact name). The ride \u2026",
          "Favourite amusement park of my family. Very relaxing. No loud music, places to picnic. Variety of food choices (not only fastfood!). Nice location in the city.",
          "Funny place for children and adults! They have everything u want! \nIf u want to try every attraction - much better to visit Liseberg in weekdays. We love it so much, a special snow \u2744\ufe0f to feel the Christmas.",
          "Liseberg at Halloween is a really fun, festive place! The kids loved seeing all the dressed up people and the decorations! We really enjoyed riding the Helix, and in fact the queue itself where we downloaded the app to play the helix game. Can\u2019t wait to go back for Christmas!!",
          "What a lovely place! No matter how old you are, liseberg is the place to go for fun, food and entertainment. The Christmas decorations are beyond our expectations. The staff is extremely friendly and professional. I would definitely come back again to create more memories!",
          "One of the best amusement parks I have been to. Amazing rides and little waiting time.",
          "Loved the rides... definitely some of the best roller coasters I've been on. Was there over the Christmas break. The entire   park was outfitted with Holiday lights... very pretty. Temperature was a bit on the cold side, so crowds were lighter than usual. No wait longer  than 10 mins to get on any ride...repeatedly\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01!",
          "Love it. Even if it\u00b4s just for taking a stroll in the evening. :D",
          "The best and most authentic amusement park i Europe. It\u00b4s even Worth your while taking a detour over Sweden to come here : )  Don\u00b4t miss Liseberg if you\u00b4r in Europe",
          "Excellent- a well thought out place. A few more skill activities would be good instead of the spinning wheel stalls and street buskers/ would have increased the atmosphere.  Overall really good - especially after dark at Christmas.",
          "Probably my favorite amusement park in the world! It's such a big place, and there are so many fun rides! The best roller coaster has to be Helix. It is the most intensive and fun ride in the amusement park! I recommend trying it out! Preferably with a friend, because the queue can be pretty long.",
          "I tried all the rollercoasters on September. It was incredible experience. Have you ever ridden a coaster for more 2 minutes? No? Then The Helix is a must try! Although you need to queue for more than 45 minutes. It is worth it.",
          "Great to go at Xmas. Beautiful place, decorated tastefully and quite magical. Loads to see, lots of small outlets. Well worth a visit.",
          "Best roller coasters in the Nordics.",
          "Big amusement park with lots of things to do. I especially liked the roller coaster Helix. If you enjoy riding roller coaster I recommend to buy the full day pass (\u00e5kband).",
          "This is the best place in Gothenborg to visit..for whole day with your family friends..\nIt's a amusement park..\nRight now everything is in Christmas spirit.. and it's so beautiful.. highly recommend..",
          "This is one of those places every Swedish person has to visit in their lifetime. From fun rides to a cozy environment with happy faces all around, you'll be sure to have a good time! I went here with my girlfriend on a date during fall and \u2026",
          "Went to the annual Christmas Market. It was a fantastic experience. Great ambiance and lots of craft foods and goods being sold.",
          "I try to go to a few Christmas markets each year around Europe and this has to be one of my favourites. They have obviously put a lot of effort into making it feel magical. Its like stepping into a movie set. Just make sure you give yourself a lot of time to venture!",
          "Liseberg is an awesome amusement park. Used to visit this park every summer as a kid and revisited Liseberg now, as an adult, when they had open for Halloween. Awesome decorations and ghosts and zombies in some parts of the park. There are rides for all ages and if you don't like to ride, it's a beautiful park to spend some time in.",
          "So much better than any Christmas market you would get in Stockholm. The 20 minute show on ice was brilliant and an unexpected surprise.",
          "Really cool place to go to. Very good place for all ages to go to. Heaps of attractions for kids and a lot of games to play. I would 100% definitely recommend to go to this place when you are around Gothenburg.",
          "Really fun! We went for a couple of hours in the evening as we couldn't fit it in anywhere else on our trip. And while it was a bit expensive for the few hours we spent there we had a bloody good time. The pay per ride format isn't perfect but its fine if you plan which rides you want. Recommend helix and balder.",
          "We went on Halloween so it was really busy after work time. The park has a quick entry which was very good make sure you book this or you could be waiting for around 40 mins. They decorated the park very well for the festivities",
          "Good amusement park and rides. Lovely decorations. Not sure why there is an entrance fee though. Went there to experience the Xmas Markt and usually those are free to enter, not here though...",
          "It's a really good theme park, if you go there I'd suggest get a all in one pass for a entire day, you won't regret it!",
          "Theme park is brilliant. Super rides. Expertly laid out park. Big queues though. Place doesn't open till 12 which doesn't help. Couldn't buy tickets online so didn't get express pass, which didn't help. Fabulous park but poorly managed.",
          "Awesome adventure Park. My family enjoyed all the rides. You must plan for full day if you have to cover most of the rides and places to visit inside the park",
          "There is a variety of different activities you can partake in for all ages including theme park rides, or if you don't want to ride any of the rides then you don't have to pay full price and can just come and enjoy their restaurants, stalls \u2026",
          "Liseberg is an amusement park located in Gothenburg, Sweden.  It is one of the most visited amusement parks. Easily accessible by car, bus, or train. Rides are fantastic but a bit on the expensive side. Recommend for the family or a group of friends.",
          "The park offers adventure, music, games, good food, and beautiful gardens.  It has a wide array of rides including a wooden rollercoaster. There are numerous restaurants and games on site. The Ferris wheel is a must-see, if you want a great \u2026",

          "Absolut fantastic. I enjoyed this Park so much.",
          "Biggest amusement park in the Scandinavia region. Must visit place for the daredevils. Do try Valkyria, Loki, throw swing, infact all the speedy rides. Best time to visit is April-Sept.",
          "Liseberg in December is the best time to go. No lines for the rides! Dress warm and have fun!",
          "Fun entertainment for all ages, especially the kids. Nice straff and well planned park",
          "Great park, plenty of arcade games and carnival games that are cheap and well worth the price. Rides are fantastic but a bit on the expensive side if you buy tickets for individual rides and not a day pass. Food and drink seems pretty reasonably priced too compared to a lot of places I've been.",
          "Loved the Christmas theme at this time of year, it was crazy busy as you'd expect. Excellent place to take the family, especially younger children.",
          "Amazing place to chill out. Make sure you plan your trip accordingly.  You can't play everything in one day. Had a great time in Liseberg. Will definitely come back again..",

          "We were here just before Xmas, the park was huge, reasonable food available at all price ranges, no alcohol sold in park except with a meal in restaurant. There was a Christmas market on which was good and variety of foods, and traditional gifts etc. Great for all ages and a",

          "We travelled here at the beginning of November. The roller coasters were much scarier than we are used to in Australia but we had a great time. There did seem to be a lot of Haunted House-type rides but unsure if that was because we went at Halloween. Beautiful park and the",
          "First time going here during Christmas time and I really enjoyed it. I recommend going when it opens and staying for a few hours so you get plenty of time to see everything before the crowd comes in the evening.",
          "Went there mainly for the Xmas mkt which is beautiful - 5m lights apparently! But downside is Having to pay for the amusement park entrance fee (sans ride) if one Juz wana go for the Xmas mkt. din Hav a gd xperience with the ticketing counter gal as we enqd abt tix that entitles",
          "A busy and popular spot for tourists and locals with a Designer market and many amusement rides. Very expensive to get a meal it seems but pretty in the evening leading up to Christmas. Somewhat befuddled by the chocolate shop betting wheels everywhere.",

          "We went in December to see the market, best too see in the evening when the lights are on. Busy as some of the rides where operating. Market stalls where a mixture of good quality and novelty items. We stopped and had dinner in the Tyrol house which was good quality food at",
          "This is just the most wonderful park at Christmas time. Our Swedish son in law took us with our daughter and two of our teenage grandchildren and it was just magical. From the moment we 'queued' with snowwmen at the entrance to the fantastic meal we experienced overlooking the",
          "We visited for the Christmas display and were blown away. There was a wide variety of stalls and shops that sold local products, as well as stunning lights and props. If you\u2019re in the nearby area around Christmas, go visit!",
          "We found out when we arrived at the gates that it will cost us about \u00a310 each to get in. We nearly walked away but were so glad we stayed. The Christmas market was set up in amongst all the rides. The site is huge and a fantastic sight after dark with the millions of lights.",
          "This is really an amusement park that for some reason costs around \u00a310 to enter . We ate worstel and fries in a Swedish equivalent of Macdonalds which was pretty rank. Most of the stalls were roulette wheels with huge bars of chocolate as prizes, we didn't find anything to",
          "If you want to get into the Christmas mood, a visit to \"Christmas at Liseberg\" is highly recommended. We have been to Tivoli in Copenhagen earlier and was excited to see if Liseberg could match this. And it sure did. Lots of small \"shops\" selling hot chocolate,",

          "We were told there was a christmas market in Liseberg, but it was more like a christmas city! Lots of stalls with traditional fare, at standard christmas market prices. Beautiful scenery - they have put in a lot of effort to make it feel magical! We saw swan lake on ice",
          "We were going to gothenburg as a family with 2 Kids at 7 and 10. We had a great time. There were a fantastic array of Christmas shops and there were a great many attractions open to try. To top it all the Liseberg ice skating show was really amazing. Top value for money.",

          "This year the decoration is over (at least my)expectations loved it all. Dont like the stalls though some might. But it is nice to come for at least one evening",
          "The market is an excuse to get you into the park and pay the fee. The stalls were selling expensive rubbish rather than traditional gifts. Unless you want the rides then the Haga market area is better.",
          "Visited Liseberg end of Nov on a weekend break to Gothenburg and was not disappointed. The park opens 12:00 to 23:00 so loads of time to enjoy all on offer at a cost of approx \u00a323 (entrance and unlimited rides)-bargain. Although not all the big rides operate in the build up to",

          "I went with my son, who is 9Y, and some friends. First time for us. My son really enjoyed the experience. There are attractions for all ages and level of braveness, fantastic Halloween decorations. The only negative point is to me, the quality of the food. We tried a restaurant",
          "I was amazed to see how well done everything was for Halloween at Liseberg. We really enjoyed it!!! We went twice in Halloween week - and that was good because during week days there are less people in lines to the scary houses. On last Saturday it was crowded with people and",
          "Wow! What a place to be. Kids love it. Liseberg has it all from the decoration, the zombies the veriety of restaurants with mix of food from different corners of the world to numbers of attractions. This place is deffinitely worth a visit while you are in scandinavia.",

          "Liseberg is super fun. There are great rides and while I didn't go on everything, I had so much fun. My favorite is the free fall where you literally have to take off your shoes (to avoid them flying off). The ride goes up super high and then drops! THE BEST.",

          "Not a huge park, but still a lot of fun and with some respectable roller coasters (my favorite was Helix). If you want to eat in one of the restaurants (and I mean restaurant, not cafeterias), recommend making reservations.",
          "We visted Liseberg only for few hours. It is like we arrived to a whole dofferent world. Everybody is laughing, they are happy and they are playing. Many games, rollercoaster. It is suitable for everyone, but a little bit overpriced. And also we should be ready to wait even 2",
          "While it cannot match the scale of Europa-Park, I found it nicer than Heide Park. It has a balanced number of attractions (thrill seekers would probably want more than 3 \"big\" coasters), nice layout, full of greenery and its own character. We visited in late August 2018 - both",
          "I spent a good few hours here in the evening - it's generally open till 10pm, though do check the opening hours/days on their website as they can be unpredictable. There was a great selection of rides, including several exciting rollercoasters, such as the Helix, their wooden",

          "Visited the park last week with two small children (2&4 year's old). The park is rather small but it is packed with rides. There were no long ques (max 10 min) for kids rides. Be sure to bring coins with you or you won't be able to play fortune wheels were you can win sweets.",

          "Liseberg was incredible! The rides are so much fun and the atmosphere in the park is very nice. Everyone can find something to enjoy; there are smaller rides for children, larger rollercoasters for the daredevil, and a few nice restaurants. If you want to have an exciting day on",
          "Have been going to Liseberg since my first Gothenburg trip over 15 years ago so have experienced it from being in my 20s to visiting with my young children. So different experience every time but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever not had a good time whether summer, winter or Halloween.",
          "My Gothenburg pass stated this attraction was Included. In fact it was purely to get through the gate, you then have to buy tickets for all your rides separately and most take 3 or 4 tickets each! Many of the cafes and facilities don't open until at least an hour after the park",
          "A very nice day, with different attractions. I very like the horror hotel. Very nice and i am pretty sure that we don't find some like this everywhere. I recommend it",

          "We visited as a group of four, and without a doubt had a fabulous time at Liseberg. The quality of the rides, cleanliness of the park and the immaculate organisation of the theme park was second to none and head and shoulders above the experiences we had at other theme parks.",
          "I liked Liseberg, plenty to do even for the smaller ones. There is something for everyone, me and the daughter tried Balder, Helix and Loke. The latter two will for sure give you an extraordinary thrill. Its a bit pricy for entrance and a wristband to enjoy all the rides, and",
          "If you travel to Sweden you should visit this amusement park. It is wonderful, so much to do. The rides are spectacular.",
          "We spent a few hours here, and really enjoyed the experience. Apart from the high Ferris wheel, we only went through children stuff, but it was fun also for us adults. Lovely park!",
          "May not be fair to review (considering above mentioned! )but we figured we'd visit since entrance included with tourist pass. Looked nice enough but really crowded and well outside city center. Thought it would have a bit more old world charm but guess the rides are all",

          "The park itself is quite compact and you don\u2019t have to walk miles to get from one attraction to another. And the rides seem to be organized in a way that it is easy to get to similar rides - like a roller coaster to another roller coaster. The biggest surprise was that the",
          "We came here in a very hot summer day. Actually an impulsive trip. We booked the tickets through their website and we got 3 express pass which we can select which attractions we want to visit and when. We selected Helix, Balder and Mechanica. It was useful because the ordinary",

          "I was here on vacation with my teen age son. I will not go on the most adventurous of rides but there were plenty of things I could do with him that was a nice compromise. 3/4 of a day is plenty of time. Go on a weekday or rainy day for lighter crowds and less wait time.",

In the 1880s the city had grown to the vicinity of the forest, and merchant August Kobb took initiative to create the city park, which has the character of an English garden with lawns and trees.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nSlottsskogen has a wide range of activities: there is Slottsskogens Djurpark, a zoo with Swedish animals, a pond with seals and penguins, a Swedish heritage area with small cottages from different counties, a playground for football, softball, frisbee golf and so forth. Slottskogen is also the home of the Way Out West Festival, which occurs annually. In August 2014, a memorial to the last concert of the band Broder Daniel during Way Out West 2008 was raised in Slottsskogen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It is a part of Evenemangsstr\u00e5ket, the thoroughfare of events \u2013 close to Korsv\u00e4gen and Sk\u00e5negatan \u2013 which includes sights of interest like Scandinavium, Ullevi, Svenska M\u00e4ssan (Swedish Exhibition Centre), Liseberg and the Museum of World Culture.\nUniverseum is divided into six sections, each containing experiment workshops and a collection of reptiles, fish and insects. Universeum occasionally gives Swedish secondary school students a chance to debate with Nobel prize-winners and professors.\n\n\n== Main sections ==\n\nThe sections of Universeum are:\n\n\"Kalejdo\" - An exhibit about Crime-investigation, laser, space, and more.\n\"Explora\" - An experiment department that is mostly about humans and technology.\n\"Vattnets V\u00e4g\" (Water's Way) - The Swedish fresh and brackish water fishes, reptiles and voles.\n\"Akvariehallen\" (The Ocean Zone) - Marine animals. This includes a 1,400,000 litres (370,000 US gal) Ocean Tank with sharks and other tropical fish, a 16 metres (52 ft) long aquarium with native marine fish, and a touch tank with rays.\n\"Regnskogen\" (The Rainforest) - A rainforest hall with tropical animals.\n\"D\u00f6dliga Sk\u00f6nheter\" (Deadly Beauties) - Deadly and venomous reptiles.The architect behind Universeum is Gert Wing\u00e5rdh.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe International Science Festival in Gothenburg\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Cramped and full of people. I would have expected some measure / restriction to be taken to protect the visiror during a pandemic. How is this museum even open?",
          "First wisit for a couple of years. Really made a already great place even better! Love the aquariums and the tropical garden!",
          "Interesting and fun place for both adults and kids. They've added the insect section as well which is so cool!",
          "This place is a lot of fun, a unique experience and a great afternoon out. Also, very cute monkeys!",
          "Its nice place for Family still, but it starts to break down at it seems that owners are not really fixing old things but let them be. Small upkeep and investment would make things better...much. And its easily done.",
          "The ticket can be bought online and this way you can skip the ticket line. I think it's valid for the whole day from the first time you have scanned it to get inside. You can go out and in at will as long as you have it available for \u2026",
          "An interesting place but it feels way overpriced. Many areas are almost empty, others are sparsely filled and the rest are only so-so. There are no real highlights really and finding your way around the place is slightly confusing. \n\nKids \u2026",
          "It was a very nice place in G\u00f6teborg. I've been there with my daughter and we truly enjoyed the time. It was really amazing to see the rainforest, see how looks the cacao tree, coffee tree etc. There were many animals so close to us, we were really impressed \u2764\ufe0f",
          "It's an amazing place for children and it's a lot of fun it's not so expensive. Lot to see and it's olso very enjoyable for everyone.",
          "The best place to go in G\u00f6teborg if you've got several hours to spare alone or with non-Gothenburger friends who want to see something special. To benefit the most from this \"Tour of our Universe\", make sure to reserve 3-4 hours.",
          "Great place to visit. It has something for everyone -kids or adults. The best thing is the way it is designed to take care of kids comfort. One challenge is , although it's a place which attracts tourists , everything is written in Swedish which makes it difficult for a tourist to comprehend",
          "The topmost part looked a bit deserted, but everything was made up by the impressive aquariums and tropical forest. I also liked the part dedicated to human exploration of space.",
          "Amazing exhibitions! Animated dinosaurs (movements and sounds) on the top floor. My personal favorite. \n\nMultilevel Amazonian forest with sloths, monkeys, colorful birds and a diversity of marine life. \n\nReptiles sections allows you to see plenty of different animals.\n\nHealth exhibition is highly interactive and suits all ages.",
          "Great exhibits and interactive experiences. If your kids crave action, this is the place to go - though it is relatively pricey. If you are looking for a calmer and cheaper experience, head next door to the World Culture museum, which is free, a very relaxing environment, and has a surprisingly broad appeal.",
          "Had so much fun going here! Highlights for me were the cloud chamber and the tropical rainforest exhibition",
          "There are some good educational activities for children. The rainforest section is well designed, and children of all ages will enjoy the experience. The exhibits are very nice, there is a lot of interactive stuff to do. The aquarium is \u2026",
          "Very good place for spending time with your kids and have fun with them . The best place to understand the interaction between human and technology. You can learn lots of new things and experience Technology in a simple way . I love rain forest and aquarium.",
          "Loved the place.  Very well laid out even to the point where you can see the different levels in the rain forest as you go up in the glass lifts. Nice that you can pop out and get back in again with the same ticket. Wear your warm weather clothing to walk round inside the rain forest!",
          "Absolutely fantastic! Never been anywhere quite like it. Lots of information as well as monkeys, birds and sloths flying/climbing/crawling around as you walk through.",
          "A must see for tourists. A bit pricey but it is worth the money. I recommend You to  leave your Jacket in the basement (lockers cost 10kr). The tropic room is very hot.",
          "Great experience. You would love it if you like aquariums. There are different environment set ups like the ocean, wild life, etc. I loved the rain forest and the exotic birds.",
          "It's very big and educational, be prepared to spend the whole day here. The exhibitions are up to date and very informative. Aquarium and rainforest are also lovely! Would visit again. There is plenty of parking spots / garages in walking distance",
          "Has a lot of exhibitions. Especially the rainforest is really fun. Also has nice coffee. It is a little expensive, but worth it.",
          "Amazing place! The 4-floor tropical rainforest zone is totally worth visiting for those who love nature and birds in particular. They also have a huge aquarium zone with sharks, arowanas and other big fishes.",
          "Very well designed STEM museum. Learn about the sea life outside Gothenburg and experience the damp and warm rainforest. Also lots of play areas for kids.",
          "This museum is awesome. Here you get to see kinds of animals, including Nordic ones. It's a bit pricey, I'd say but the place is well organized and one can easily spend a couple of hours here. The gift shop has awesome gifts for both the young and old ones. When in Gothenburg, make sure to visit Universeum.",
          "This place is amazing to visit on the forest section. The way the paths were built where you start from the higher ground and walk your way down while passing by fish tanks with piranha\u2019s, or monkeys, great vegetation with wide verity of \u2026",
          "This is definitely the place to spend a day in Gothenburg. Bring the kids, bring the family, bring everyone. Also cafe and gift shot outside the pay admission area. And you can spot the monkeys from the cafeteria if you look closely.",
          "Really interesting and interactive displays. Gets children really involved with science. Great if the weather is not the best and you want to get out and do something.",
          "Good place to experience rainforest in a nutshell. One of the major tourist attraction in Goteborg!",
          "It's really hot in the rainforest",
          "Good place overall.\n\nThey advertised small Panda, but could not see it during my visit. I was there the whole day until 17:00, and despite going through the rain forest 2 times. So deducted one star.",
          "Fun place to visit. Indoor Climate control is very good",
          "Really nice place, highly recommend it for anyone interested in science or nature. When I was there the space exhibition was in construction, which was a bummer. \n\nThe price was a bit high, but I heard they donate some of the money to charities that are working for a better environment",
          "Ocean and forest areas are the most impressive ones in Universeum. It's a little bit chaotic, not so easy to find your way through the place. For this price i would expect a little bit more specimens but I don't regret. I think this please is mostly meant for children anyway. Watch out, the open (forest) area is extremally humid!",
          "Fantastic place. And there\u2019s a lot of animals that you will love.",
          "Very nice place for science enthusiastic.must visit with kids. Specially the artificial rainforests and the reptile section.",
          "I think this is one of the best places to visit in Gothenburg. There are lots of activities you can do and enjoy there. The Rainforest and Aquarium Zone are my favorite. The Science zone is also very interested. You can play and learn a lot from this zone. \ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc26\ud83e\udd9c\ud83e\udd8e\ud83d\udc1f\ud83e\udd88\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc19\ud83d\udd77\u2698\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Universeum is a big building to introduce science to people. It has two sections, one is a zoo and the other is a science rooms for kids to get to know about interesting experiments.\nI have visited the zoo part several times. It is a nice \u2026",
          "So lovely and interesting for young and old. Enough space to play for the little ones and good things to know and try out for the older kids. The rainforest is very good and the animals,also the ocean scenes. The way of the water you will find in Sweden,brings you a piece of nature in town.",
          "I thought that this was going to be something completely different than what it actually was. Small narrow hallways and kids running around everywhere, hard to locate exits and where to go. Some areas were super cold, other super hot. Kind of expensive too. Would not recommend.",
          "The animals were very unhappy,I almost started to cry when I saw a small sloth sleeping in a very tiny place. The tucano birds were kept under a net and they tried to cut it. 2 snakes in a place of 1 square meter...other than that, the place is not in a good condition, no nice plants..I strongly recommend not to go.",
          "Good mix of science park and animals, including a rainforest. Great and friendly  staff.",
          "It was really cool seeing all the creatures",
          "One of the places in Gothenburg city, which is \"the must\" to visit after Liseberg amusement park is a rain forest place inside Universeum. So many fun things to do and see for the whole family!",
          "Great place to spend time with kids. Nature, science...",
          "Very nice place for all ages of children even for adults. There are many permanent exhibitions and always there are some temporary theme exhibitions as well. It\u2019s a big place so spare at least half of the day for the first visit.",
          "Attractive for children and adults, lovers of technology and nature....Be prepared to spend hours inside...",
          "Just amazing <3 it's worth every minute spending there!",
          "Interesting place, especially for children but it not worth the (expensive) ticket price in my opinion. We enjoyed dinosaurs and rain forest..even if there were points were you couldn't see what it was expected to see ( frogs for example). Spaces are too narrow so it was not easy too move when it is crowded.",
          "An amazing day out, animals not kept caged up and very interactive experience",
          "It was great fun and good value for money. Appealed to all ages.",
          "Universeum is a multi-story zoo, aquarium, and science adventure. It's full of interactive exhibits, geared more towards families and children but interesting and informative for all ages.\n\nThe first level includes a restaurant and a small Cafe with snacks and drinks.",
          "Good to keep kids entertained on a rainy weekend. The indoor rainforest was very cool - the tucans and the sloth were our favourite. Educational and fun.",
          "Great fin for both kids and adults!\nI recommend 2 days not needing to rush through and there is enough things to do to fill out 2 days.",
          "Must see museum. Its really good for kids as well as for adults. It is a combination of aquarium, rain forest, many exhibitions like space, science, dinosaur etc. many activities for kids. Restaurant is inside the museum and elevator is also available. At the end you can visit the shop inside the museum to buy souvenirs, toys, etc.",
          "This is a great place to go for learning about science concepts in a playful way and to watch all kinds of different animals. There are different sections like the rain forest where birds and butterflies fly free, frogs jump across the \u2026",
          "Great place to learn and very interesting. Little overpriced but ok.",
          "Great dinner party with 180 people in the aquarium hall",
          "There were monkeys in there with no cage!!! So many interesting thing in there....this is the first time/place i had to kind of drag my 3 yrs old niece out cuz she was having so much fun. She keeps wanting to go back there when we are near \u2026",
          "Great fun, a bit warm in the djungle section but that is needed for the animals well being",
          "Great for a rainy day. Although it seemed to take very little time to go through it.",
          "Way overpriced for what it is. I would not recommend if you don't have kids as this is mainly aimed at them and there's an entire section that is for 0-12yr olds.",
          "Universeum is a great place to bring your kids. There are ample opportunities to both learn and to simply enjoy the environment. The journey through the complex is pedagogically designed and combines the architecture with a living indoor \u2026",
          "Great educational place for children to learn about nature and science. Good for a half a day family activity. There are different floors with different sections. One of them is a unique rain forest area with tropical birds. A restaurant and a souvenir store are available on the bottom floor.",
          "Rain forest and aquariums are very good. Few reptiles. The other exhibitions are not really worth it. They are worn and in so so shape. Also too small. Chemistry lab could be interesting for kids(4-12) though. Dinosaurs seemed to excite the kids, but again,nah.",
          "My husband and I had so much fun here today! It was amazing learning about the rainforest and sharks. Would be a great experience with kids, but also unmissable for young at heart adults like us!!",
          "Family oriented attraction, particularly for the children",
          "A wonderful experience.  Many birds flying from side to side of the \"reservation.\"  The aquarium was full of many rare fish and sharks.  There is also a reptile section.  In some places there are many interactive games that help you better \u2026",
          "Interesting day out on a rainy day. More suited for children of all ages. Easy to find and get to but a little difficult to navigate on the inside!",
          "OMG - funky museum with the best canteen in Goteborg! Great place for kids especially the space museum which had lots of activities and things to participate in. Has a jungle in a four-storey atrium as well as an aquarium. Not expensive and next door to the theme park .",
          "Overall a fairly nice little zoo/museum. Very child friendly with lots of places to discover and explore. -1 star for the steep pricing",
          "Every family visiting Gothenburg needs to go here for an joyful active, animals and science themed, museum visit. Totally worth the entrance fee. Check out the shop for great gifts!",
          "Entertaining! Good for kids.\nOne thing I did mind though, it was way too warm our last visit, it felt like whole building was leaking.\nDinosaur attraction was so so, expected more excitement.",
          "There were two downsides to our visit. The first being the price which is truly extortionate. The second was that the space part was closed when we were there. The worlds they have created are magical though. Who would have thought that the \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with children and family. \nHighly recommended.",
          "Good place for a weekend retreat. There is a floor each for dinosaur models, sea life aquarium, reptiles, rainforest, space (under construction when we went!!), Hub, Chemistry labs and health r(elated equipments to play for the kids!).\n\nThe \u2026",
          "Rain forest is amazing but other stuff is not very interesting at least for adults.\nHowever there is a lot of space for children to play",
          "Very crowded but other than that a really fun experience and a must see",
          "A \"must\" place to visit as a family.\nWe had a flight to catch late afternoon so we thought why not stopping there to kill some time as  it was located within 10 min walk from where we stayed.\n\nDefinitely not disappointed at all. In fact we \u2026",
          "Good, but I'm not a great fan of these kind  science museums",
          "Very fun with your whole family. Including the elder \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd76\ud83d\udc89",
          "Great, really nice stuff. Be sure to look up the time for experiment sessions you want to try.",
          "My son absolutely loved it, he didn\u2019t know what he was gonna look at first, he wanted too look everywhere at the same time! Very fun. The butique is expensive though. The visit was interesting!",
          "Lots of interesting and fun stuff for both kids and elders.",
          "The great one source of knowledge in world.\ud83d\ude00",
          "More family centred. If you like fish then great, a few other animals but not much, space zone is OK. Food is really expensive and small portions. Dinosaurs were large and moving, but not really very exciting",
          "I never expected the replica of the jungle to actually feel so hot and humid. The aquarium was good too, two big pools of fishes (and sharks!) plus several smaller ones with different species. The other smaller exhibitions (like the \u2026",
          "Expansive tickets with not much to see inside.",
          "Spend a Saturday here! The rainforest section was really nice. You can see sloths, monkeys, birds, and fish!",
          "Loved it fun place with a lot of things to see and do",
          "The rainforest is absolutely fantastic and the animals there are wonderful. The rest of the exhibits are made for smaller children, just saying. I don't think it's worth 225kr",
          "Very beautiful place for family!",
          "Kids liked it. I waited with luggage outside. Killed a few hours \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "An amazing visit and fun all day long",
          "It's okay, maybe it's better in the high season, a very mediocre place that is hard to justify the price of entry.",
          "A lot of fun, facts and live animals. Small monkees are jumping side by side with people and exotic birds flying over your head in the jungle. Dinosaurs are on top floor. They look good with smooth and detailed mechanical movments. Kids will love this place for sure.",
          "Great for families\nUniverseum is great for families with small children. It offers great experiences of nature. However, it is quite small",
          "Half museum, half zoo, with a bit of a safari feel, this place is definitely one of Gothenburg\u2019s gems. The gigantic aquarium features sharks and sting rays in one place, and is the most notable thing.",
          "Great place for kids , u can bring your own food and eat there .... no matter what tje weather is ... its a great place to have fun",
          "Great learning place for kuds and adults alike",
          "Very good, especially for children. At the entrance, there is a bar and a restaurant. All the services are very good, but not all animals can be seen as they sleep a lot, like monkeys. There is a great number of fish that you can see and you can enjoy the rainforest experience!",
          "Nice place. Water path with ocean fishes is super. Rainforest would be fantastic if not so hot as outside (at least for me) and wet.",
          "Great museum with fantastic educational value and entertaining workshops. Our kids learned about the pH scale in a chemistry lab.",
          "Very interesting indoor zoo I would say. It was educational however, at the end of the day it's still caged animals. The good thing is you can leave for 90 min and re enter with your ticket. So I gave it to my friend because it's quite expensive.",
          "Great way to spend a couple of hours. Really well thought out environments that encourage curiosity.",
          "The Aquarium and rainforest area are great. The rest of the exhibitions are geared much more towards children, so I only skimmed. They looked well designed and fun. The Dinos on the roof are a nice plus.",
          "Universeum, the place to go to make your kids happy. There are many variety of fishes and tropical birds and animals. There are also few sections dedicated to space and science. \n\nPlan as it takes most of the day if you plan to visit in \u2026",
          "More if a child focused place.",
          "Always a magical place to visit seeing all the exotic animals and science stuff to test. But it does feel like its lost its touch over the years. But a good place to spend an afternoon in for its very cheap price.",
          "Great place mutch  too see wort going and enjoy",
          "Really cool and educational. A surprising amount of non-aquatic animals, some of which get pretty close too.",
          "Whole day fun for kids and a good experience for parents",
          "Great museum for introducing science to kids, with many creative exhibitions.",
          "Great place to be through all age categories!\nMy favourites the aquarium and lovely made rain forest. Absolute highlight the dinosaurs.",
          "Absolutely loved this place! Spent almost the whole day exploring it. There is simply so much to do and see. The indoor rainforest was beautiful and so informative as you went round, all the signage being in both Swedish and English. \nThe \u2026",
          "Universeum is certainly a cool and welcoming place. While mostly aimed toward children and young people, parents and adults of all ages will also find a fair share of entertaining things to see.\n\nThe fish section is particularly calming to \u2026",
          "The place is super cool. We spent here almost entire day with our 4 year old daughter. She enjoyed (almost) every bit, from the rainforest to space area to aquarium. But most of all, of course, she liked the playground. Don't forget to take your nickel with you to use the locker.",
          "Great for the kids. Lots of fish and animals and ways to interact",
          "Very interesting place to visit, however it's better to visit it during the week as during weekends it gets full of children, making it a very noisy place.",
          "Rainforest, science lab, funny and exciting play and exercise for kids & family",
          "A must if you visit Goteborg with kids",
          "Great place to visit. Shame lot of animals were hibernating for the winter",
          "Entrance not so cheap...for 2hours ...rain forest enjoyable",
          "We have spent a great part of our day in the Universum. Our kids (8,4 & 2) loved it. Very interesting expositions and their rainforest is breathtaking.\n\nA must see!",
          "Great place to visit, not just a kids place. Staff are friendly and speak great English.",
          "Great place for the whole family. Lots of animals Only downside is that the floor layout causes everyone to use the two small elevators. This makes it very frustrating getting around.",
          "A lot of interesting things to see, specially if you are into animals, great for kids",
          "A great place to visit with your kids. Loved every moment of our time there! Especially the dinosaurs and the rainforest zone.",
          "This is a great place to bring the kids! Cool animals, space and dinosaurs! \nThe only down side is that the price is a but too high.",
          "Good place to take the kids on weekends\nMinus is the price...",
          "We liked the science show during Halloween.",
          "We had a lot of fun here! The nice thing was when we left for lunch, we were able to come right back in afterwards. The place was fun to explore. The area with the birds was sooooooo humid it was uncomfortable but still fun to see. We spent most of the day here.",
          "Very appreciated by the kids (7 and 9 years). Lots to do so expect to stay several hours. Maybe a bit pricy but I think it was worth it.",
          "Brilliant, you can eaily spend a day here and still want to come back.",
          "Very nice atmosphere, little pricy though!",
          "One of best places for visiting in Gothenburg",
          "My son loves going here and enter the jungle area or watch the fish in the aquarium. Can also recommend the new tech area, where you can try VR. I suggest 2-3 hours to be able to fully take advantage of everything that's on offer.",
          "A beautiful immersion into the most exotic parts of the nature right in the middle of Gotheborg. I was impressed by the extent of the exhibition and the ingenuity of our Swedish hosts. A lot of work and love for the nature has created a wonderful experience that I recommend to everyone.",
          "The kids loved it. Lodads of kids but never felt crowded. Great shark-tour with enthusiastic guide. Lovely aquarium.  Food options could be better but overall a must if you have kids or is a kid at heart. We were there before it opened, and had pre-bought our tickets. Highly recommend.",
          "Great place to visit with kids highly recommend, gets very busy in peak times be warned.",
          "Huge indoor rainforest with a beautiful aquarium.",
          "Really love this place. Now i love it even more since i have a kid ;)",
          "Beautiful place with tropical forest where one can see birds and monkeys. Dinosaurs in real size and fine aquaria.",
          "Perfect for a holiday with the kids. There is something to see for everyone, fish, rainforest, dinosaurs and two floors of play and learn",
          "Not worth the money you pay. It\u2019s nice to go just once!",

          "A very nice place to see \ud83d\ude09",
          "Tropical forest part is really nice and varied, birds come close to visitors. Aquariums are so-so, but the beginning of the exhibition about local birds, frogs and snakes was all empty and in rather bad shape. Science part is made for younger children. Tropical part is definitely a highlight.",

          "Great time, like the variety. Was a little sad that the animals from the water exhibit were still away in late March, but got to see reptiles and amphibians in the other exhibits. Also in the rainforest exhibit this green bird kept following me, I don't know if it was my whistling?",

          "Kids absolutely loved it! Amazing outing for the family",

          "Fantasticno,\nextra expiriens.\nGreat place",
          "Great experience! But definitely a lot more fun if you come here together with friends or children. Half of the experience consists of trying things out on your own, and if you're alone (which was the case for me), this becomes difficult.",
          "Super cute museum for people of all ages",
          "This place is amazing. Well worth your money. \nIt's a mini zoo/aquarium combined with experiment and science rooms. \n\nYou start of by going through an aquarium area where you can find some freshwater fishes first, followed by saltwater \u2026",
          "Sweden's National Science Centre is a compact but full on experience. Walk through three distinctly different areas and then into two floors of hands-on practical experience. With skilled, friendly and professional staff it is a place well \u2026",

          "Very fun museum. Mostly reminds me of a zoo with all the animals that are displayed. The rainforest is incredible. The museum is easy to reach from Korsv\u00e4gen and offers a student discount. \nReason why no 5 stars is the lay out. It got more \u2026",
          "A good way to spend time and learn things about the flora and fauna.",
          "Nice but expensive. Go there if you have plenty of time. Give questions to the staff, they like to share their knowledge.",
          "Amazing place for children's and grow up childrends, you need a lot of time to visit all the amazing and interesting things you can find here, the only bad think in my personal opinion, are the life conditions of some animals, but is just an opinion, don't miss it if you like science or wild life.",
          "Good for a rainy day in Gothenburg. Interesting topics for younger and older kids, ours enjoyed the chemical tests they could try and the astronauts. The rainforest was nice, but extremely hot and wet. Clearly we were not up to a visit to \u2026",

          "A lovely place to be if you like nature and love to watch different animals as how they live. The best part is to watch big fishes and sharks from below water level, some of them are just amazing!!",
          "Nice natural museum with a small aquarium.  Better the rain forest with beatiful ibis and tucanos",
          "It\u2019s not bad, but somehow it felt a bit empty and worn out compared to when it opened back in 2001.\nSome things are gone, the new displays isn\u2019t that impressive, some displays havn\u2019t changed for quite a while and can feel a bit old.\nThey \u2026",

          "Great place to visit on your stay in Gothenburg.\nIt is divided into different areas focused on science and space, marine life and a tropical area so there is something that appeals to everyone.\nThey have sloths. \nThat alone is a reason to visit.\nMake sure to buy your tickets online to skip the queue.",

          "One of the best museums I've been too! Well organised so you get so see everything in a clear way, with a great way of showing the whole universe experience. Free entry with the Gothenburg City Card, and great for kids and adults. The rainforest is so much fun with amazing birds",
          "This was a quite good museum, even if it was short. The best part was the rainforest, as well as the water exhibition at the top floor. The rest of the museum didn't have anything special or unique so it was a bit underwhelming. But I would still recommend a visit, especially",
          "This was an excellent, entertaining place to visit with lots to see including fish, sloths, marmosets etc. We also had a couple of coffees in a very nice little cafe on the ground floor, and the shop is very good, too",
          "This is a must visit if you are in Gothenburg it's just amazing. The whole effect is quite surreal with birds flying overhead and rain constantly falling. It's great fun for all the family and the science exhibits are great as well. Just one thing if you don't want to get stuff",

          "This place has an aquarium, a sealed rain forest place with multiple levels, rope bridges and birds and other exhibits such as live snakes of various levels of toxicity. If you have not been to a similar place before then this might be worth a visit, especially with children.",
          "We popped into here as it was part of the city card free attractions. It is similar to the Eden project and Sea World, but on a smaller scale, but with a Science/Space section too. Thoroughly enjoyable, children will love it.",

          "We spent a Saturday here, and more hours than we intended to even if we felt there was yet more we hadn't explored. We didn't see any monkeys on this trip which was a disappointment. This place is very organised with lockers to store belongings (10kr) and eating places if you",
          "Universeum have managed to mold together an interactive zoo experience of the rain forrest and the best interactive parts that many museums today only touches upon. Here kids can try out, touch and smell as well as watch things. We spent a whole day at Universeum and the kids",
          "We visited as 3 adults and 2 children aged 7 and 4. There was something for every one of us and we felt we got our moneys worth.",
          "Just the internal design of this place is worth 5 stars. I recommend to every one but especially to families with children.",
          "It is exotic to say the least in this part of world to be having such an attraction. It is a must stop if one comes as a tourist to Gothenburg with kids. Artificial tropical forest with birds and flora is nice to visit. There are numerous peripheral simulation centres to spark",
          "Visited Universeum yet again, probably the fifth or sixth time over the last couple of years. Really great place with a lot of activities, perfect for small and bigger children. We usually spend around 2-3 hours here without feeling that it gets boring, even though we've been",

          "We arrived early to this museum which is good as it gets very crowded. We pre bought city cards which gives you access to this museum and others in the area. The museum has a little something for everyone. We didn't have any children in our party but everyone still enjoyed",
          "We went expecting great things. It was a little underwhelming. In London we have the science museum and natural history museums next to each other and both are predominantly free. This was quite pricey for the 2-3 hours we spent there. Quite a good range of interactive things",
          "I was there to check the place, and I was surprised: many floors of attractions for curious children. It was a bit pricey, though. Their shop has also very nice products for stimulating kids into science.",
          "It's unbelievable a rain forest in the heart of the city. We spend almost the entire day in the rain forest, aquarium and different exhibitions. From our point of view a must do on a rainy day in Gothenburg. We will go again.",

          "Eat before you go, or picnic, or at a different time than everyone else. The cafe was packed between 12-2 although plenty of tables, just a long queue. Use the lockers because the 'Rain forest experience' is very hot and steamy (28 degrees), but the SEK10 is not a deposit, you",
          "Universeum has a whole bunch of, what you might call exhibits. There are the exploratoriums about space, technology etc. which are mostly targeted towards kids but where adults can have a good time as well. But the main attractions are the fish tanks and the rainforest. The",

          "The animal life is spectacular and the way they are experienced is really cool. You can wander through the tropical zone and hang out with the birds and animals. The fish tank..well sharks as well, is a massive glass tank where you can walk through a tunnel of glass and have",
          "Here you will find loads to do! Prepare yourself by visiting their webpage in order to know what to expect and find your way. The only small drawback I can see is that it is a lot to take in hence one need several hours to go through it all and the entrance fee is a bit pricey.",
          "Very good museum with a lot to see and do as well. The zoo with all kind of animals are a great treat. Also there is a science part where children can play and build their own toys",
          "This is a really good venue and worth attending on any trip. The rainforest area is great for animals and all the floors are very interesting. The floors get a bit confusing to go through in complete order but doesn't really cause any issues. Would definitely go back again.",
          "An amazing place to explore with the whole family, animals, rainforest, tecnichal area etc...we walked there for hours looking at all the animals and other things to do, well worth a visit!",
          "Even open on Chistmas Day the Universeum was really interesting and certainly takes a few hours to take in. The way it is designed is so clever, with the indoor rainforest and small primates and birds hopping about, it really was a lovely visit. The 'Space' section ws",

          "I loved the sawnosed shark, he/she appeared to actually be smiling at us. My son liked the western horned Grebe (a bird) and all the interactive exhibits were just cool. We had been disappointed that the museum of natural history was closed, but after visiting Universal twice in",
          "It is like a covered zoo with exotic animals. It is well organized on at least 4 floors. The only problem is that it closes at 18:00 also on Saturday. It is a very interesting programme for all age. We loved it. Don't miss it if you are on Gothenburg. (It is a free programme",
          "We decided to visit Universeum as part of the Gothenburg City Pass. As an indoor attraction it would be good to escape the cold for a few hours, or so we thought... The upstairs aquarium exhibit felt like we were outdoors, brr. We quickly descended to the next floor down, which",
          "Both of my elder grandchildren have a annual subscription card to Universeum and they never tire of going there. In fact it is hard to get them out of the place. They look ce the rainforest and all the games and gadgets on the two top floors. I enjoy going there with them too.",

          "Although a part of it was under construction while we visited, there was plenty to see. Lots of educational exhibits as well as fun stuff. The kids enjoyed it, as did the adults.",
          "My husband and I spent an enjoyable half day here. It is located right next door to the Liseberg Amusement Park and as that did not open until the afternoon we decided to spend the morning at the Universeum before going there later. This is an excellent attraction with plenty",
          "We spent almost five hours here, and only saw half of the museum (the half with the tropical rainforest, wild environments and aquarium; plus the Jobbis playarea). We'd love to return to Gothenburg some time and see the rest. It's all brilliantly done, and the cafe on the",
          "We paid a visit here during a recent break away. This place has a great combination between animals science. Although the animals are what you'd expect of somewhere like this, the science element was much better than I expected. There are loads of things to get stuck in to",
          "If you are with kids, they will probably love this place. For adults, I thought it was a little disappointing. In the first area the insects and reptiles were in plastic or were not there at all. The aquarium is interesting. The Space area is also worth the visit.",
          "First of all, start at the top floor and work your way down. We had so much fun visiting, even without children. It was a great experience and it can keep you entertained for hours. Be warned, it is busy with lots of families.",
          "Imagine going from sleet and snow entering the jungle. Not an everyday experience in the cold north, but possible at Universeum. Add some science and sharks to the mix and them you have learnt something yourselves and your kids are happy and tired. Much recommended!!",
          "We spent half a day here and could stay longer. Fun not only for families but for adults without children too.",
          "A fun place for the hole family. A lot of animals to watch and science to explore. The only negative thing about this place is that it is quite expensive.",
          "A fantastic science Centre where you can see many animals up close. You can follow streams see the Swedish see life, walk through a rainforest and watch tropical fishes. You can also visit the the space exhibition. It's worth a visit.",
          "This seems like a mix of a small, poor quality zoo allied to a 30 year old combination of the science museum and natural history museum from London. It is extremely expensive for what it is.",
          "This museum boasts a rain forest, and yes, it is constantly drizzling in the rain forest, it also has an aquarium and in the winter, an exhibit outdoors about mammoths. It also has a little bit of technology display as well as interactive exhibits about physical fitness, music,",
          "This is def a most when visiting Gothenburg.. it doesnt matter if you are old och Young, the Place is Amazing.",
          "This place had everything and was thoroughly enjoyable. The rainforest was great and my particular favourite was the ocean zone. It was also great for interactive exhibits for all ages.",
          "So amazing place with all the kinds of alive animals , especially the fish , colorfull birds , i like it",
          "Nice, unusual combination of a zoo, aquarium, exploration and science area with a playground. Our kids enjoyed the variety and could easily spend a full day here. Surprisingly empty too while visiting.",
          "Lots to see and good interactive areas. Both the front rainforest and aquarium areas were really good in particular.",
          "I loved this place. All three level were fun and educational. I would encourage all to make this one of your go to places.",
          "I believe is great that big cities have museums like this for adults and kids! It was great to have a taste of a rain forest with birds and monkeys all around! I came here with my mom, but it was so nice to see small children running around enjoying the museum and all the stuff",
          "An educational and fun madhouse! We started out thinking this would be primarily targeted toward children, which is technically correct, but they have filled seven floors with so many different themes and things to learn about, that the target audience didn't matter. You'd be",
          "The highlight of this place was the huge indoor rainforest, which really was impressive. Ibis roamed the building freely, along with Monkeys and butterfly\u2019s. There was smoke, rain, and thunder in the background. It really did feel like you were in the Amazon - especially when",
          "It's actually quite good for the kids. It's pretty big and quited good variation with things to do (for exemple there is a small rainforest as well as experiments for kids)",
          "Spent a day here with our 10 and 12 year old, and they had plenty to do and see during the day. They loved to build forts with the large building blocks, and looking at all the birds and fishes. We had a break where we went out to check in on our hotel and grab a bite to eat and",
          "We weren't sure what to expect from the building's outside but this place is pretty awesome. A modern building housing an actual rainforest over several floors with flying birds, marmoisettes, massive fish - really impressed. The Aquarium level was also amazing - the sharks they",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. A proper rainforest visit with exotic birds flying around you, monkeys climbing so close and staff always nearby to inform you even more, I can definitely recommend the Universeum!",
          "Thought it was going to be aimed at children but was quite enjoyable for a group of young adults. Is located quite centrally and was very easy to find.",
          "As i was a kid i remember of combining a day with first going to the Universeum then to Liseberg. Both you and your kid(s) will be amazed by walking through the park. And it wont take up all your time. Just remember to bring your wallet, cause when your kid(s) has seen real",
          "Universeum is a perfect place to visit with the family or just as a couple. The playroom is also a lot of fun - don't miss out on it!",
          "Here is a good place to visit your kids but be ready for the crowd normal in that kind of entertainment. It's very close to Liseberg Park and very easy public transportation for all places in the city.",
          "This is a great museum. Lots of areas to explore and many hands on activities. Really enjoyed the space section, great fun. We visited mid week and it was pretty quiet.",
          "We have been going to this museum yearly since the children were little. They loved the rain forest where they can see animals in their natural habitat. It's truly a magical place and although we wont visit now as often because teens have different interests, we will still",
          "It takes time to go around and it's often a lot of people. Go there on a weekday if you have the possibility. The water tank with Sharks and a lot of other fishes. The rainforrest , with special birds .There is a lot of things for children to do. You can have something to eat",
          "We (me, Mrs and two children) usually goes here twice a year, and we enjoy Universeum. Universeum caters to the hwole family, from toddlers and upwards. The fish tanks, the rainforest and space departments are my favorites. There's a playground and lot of interactive exhibitions",
          "Seen a lot of these places over the years after travelling extensively with my daughter (now a teenager), but this was free entrance with City pass , we had a great time , nature never bores us and this was a great afternoon , the aquarium is fascinating , loved that there were",
          "One of my favorite places in Gothenburg and one of the best in its kind. Every visit is an adventure! A big aquarium with swordfish and many species of sea life to \"amazon forest\" and a travel to the space is only some of the things that a visitor can experience.",
          "Nice place. Alot of activities. SOme of them very kind of chepish, but the aquarium and the rainforest was excellent.",
          "This science/nature attraction is included in the Gothenburg city card and proved to be an excellent option for a rainy day. It is easily located right next to public transport (we used tram 5). There is a large entrance area with a cafe, restaurant, cloakrooms, lockers, store",
          "Make sure you stop at coffee shop at the entrance to see the toucans in the rainforest - even if you do nothing else",
          "I have visited many Science Centres in the UK (and I'm generally not a huge fan) BUT this is quite simply the best and totally different from anything I've experienced before, in my opinion. One can walk through a rainforest where endangered monkeys clamber overhead and tropical",
          "This was a very fun place to go, especially with a group of friends. There were lots to do including a rainforest, space section, health section, aquarium and lots more. We are from London and visited Gothenburg for 5 days and decided to visit the Universeum. It was a good day",
          "Loved spending the day at the Universeum. We went on a Monday so it wasn't too crowded and we had a really good time. It's not super-cheap (about \u00a318 for an adult ticket when we went) but it's no more than attractions in other cities and it feels like you get a lot more for your",
          "Well organized museum with exibitions for all ages- We enjoyed the most rain forest. Unfortunately not so many animals to see, but it was the first time we saw sloths from that close and it was so cute! One of the best interactive museums in Europe.",
          "This facility is modern and with 4 levels, there are some good interactive play areas for the children. The rain forest was most impressive for me. Lifts, steps and access for strollers make it very family friendly.",
          "TOP TIP: FREE ENTRY WITH THE GOTHENBURG CITY CARD This a good quality attraction / museum. My 11 year old son particularly enjoyed the re-energised rainforest exhibit which even had birds and monkeys roaming free. The marine life exhibit was large and worthwhile seeing as",
          "I was here for three hours with my two children, ages 4 years & 5 months. It was our first visit and overall a very pleasant one. After some time one of the employees told me I could put my stroller at the entrance and pick ut a \"Baby-Bj\u00f6rn\" at the ticket counter to borrow for",
          "This museum offers you the possibility to stay with animals in their own habitat. The tropical zone makes you feel like you are really in a jungle thanks to the climate they have created. You can enter into animals's cage and stay incredibly close to them, even though you can",
          "Mostly live birds and fish, a few reptiles and insects behind glass. Space and body have interactive fun stuff especially for 6-18 crowd but fun for older crowds. Good environment for English readers.",
          "This is one of the best natural history museums that I have seen. The elevator takes you to the top and you walk downhill through the museum and exhibits until you are back at street level. The aquarium exhibits are first rate. I loved it.",
          "When we were there the \"rainforest\" wasn't ready yet. But what we saw was small cages for the animals and bored fish everywhere. I'm not a child but my friends daughter 12 yrs old who was with me was not that amused. Not that giving in a learning matter. The silence and",
          "Located almost next to the amusement park lise erg this is a perfect activity for a rainy day. A mix between a science Centre and interactive rainforest is offers many different activities for all ages ( ofcorse most fun for younger children ) there is a small gift shop as well",
          "Having been around this 'museum' I'm still not sure what the focus was. There are areas devoted to the Ice-Age, the rain-forest, the oceans and lunar exploration among others. It's certainly very pleasant to wander through and young kids will love the interactive exhibits.",
          "Our kids our grown up but we thought this still worth a trip on a rainy day. Lots is directed at kids but we still found several points of interest.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Universeum. We only had a few hours to spare, but we enjoyed the different parts of the museum, especially the sports area where the kids got to check their abilities, the space area and wonderful design of the rain forest. Highly recommended !",
          "A lot to see and do for the whole family plenty of different environments to see, sea to space there's snakes to mammoths and it changes themes every now and again great day out for all ages",
          "Do not miss this attraction. Next to the fabulous Liseberg you find Universeum. A piece of rain forrest inside. And a large aquarium. And art. And science. Go with kids!",
          "Nice place to spend all the day with children: Constant improvements. There is always something new. Perfect for a day with typical \"swedish summer weather\" .",
          "I went here and did lilked the way they maked the tour around the \"world\" . You go from the highest floor and a certain part of the world to other parts and other floors. Loved all the wildlife and education site of it. Good visit for children!!",
          "This is a very educational science center. Its big and lots of activities to do. Its also a museum a must visit in Goteburg if you have children",
          "Watch sharks and other fish in big tanks, visit a rain forest, take a look at snakes and much, much more. There is so much to see and do, but it's on a rather simple level. Kids 6-12 will probably love it, but take your time!",
          "For the price we paid we couldn't have expected more. So much is included in the price that you would have to pay for separately in the UK. Reccommend this to anyone who's never been or has kids. An amazing day out!",
          "This museum is quite large. It is a place not just for looking at things but also being able to do things yourself which makes it very suitable for children of all ages. It was very crowded when we visited. There was even a waiting line outside the building 1 hour after the",
          "The place is huge and it's a nice experience for kids. However, it was pretty crowded and not all the animal announced could be seen...",
          "Very fun and interesting museum/aquarium/science park for all ages. The only negative thing I have to say is that you can't bring a stroller into the rain forest.",
          "Probably more for familys but it was a really pleasant walk through the floors. Interesting too but really harmonical even tho you had little kids running around your feet. Take your time if you are there, dont stress it, as there is a lot to see.",
          "Seriously, wow! My 4 year old son thought this place was amazing, as did we! What a great place in the middle of the city! Has a giant atrium that houses rainforest animals! Complete with bridges to tree houses and you're one with the animals walking through passage ways! So,",
          "A great and lively way to discover various environments, with animals, plants, activities and guides. Perfect for kids, but very well fitting for adults as well. Only downside of great places: during week-ends or vacation periods it can get extremely crowded.",
          "We loved coming here. It's great they have a family price. Awesome interactive fun and lots to look at. Try to pick a day when it is less crowded like a weekday.",
          "There are so many interactive activities in this museum that kids will be thrilled to the top. The 'tropical jungle' area was very very nice. Make sure you go to the top of the museum to visit the ice age.",
          "The jungle walk through the rainforest is very real and you get close to trees, birds, small monkeys and fish, and both kids and parents will learn how important the rain forest is. The Ocean department is also worth spending time at. Practical stuff: Food in the restaurant is",
          "This museum is very much aimed at children under the age of, say, 12. The rainforest part and the aquarium are good, but the rest aren't very interesting, especially not to adults. Most kids seem to like it though.",
          "We visited the Universeum in July 2016. Overall it was slightly disappointing, a lot of the exhibits in the rainforest section (the star attraction at time of visit) were empty and it didn't feel like it lived up to what was advertised. Still a good day out, just don't expect",
          "Universeum had many fun things: rainforest with butterflies and birds, acquariums with exotic fish, interactive exhibits on health and space for example. Some animals exhibits seemed to be under renovation during our visit and we were confused with navigating the rainforest.",
          "We went to Universeum because we were tired of going to amusement parks. Everything else but Lisebergs was closed for a holiday. We enjoyed the museum and spent several hours there. Many things were hands-on, but several things were broken. The only place to eat was outdoors on",
          "This was recommended to us as something fun to do, it cost 40 something pounds for two of us to get in. Not really suitable for people without kids (we were the only ones without a small child) and all the activities and exhibits are aimed for young children - great to tire kids",
          "Halfdead animals and poor sience. Go to some real museum instead. I recomend Sj\u00f6fartsmuseet. They cover many of the same themes much better.",
          "My husband and I visited this museum on our way back to the airport. This place is absolutely THE place to take children when in Gothenburg. We didn't have our children with us, but wish we did. As a couple it was ok but I don't think we quite got the benefit without our kids",
          "The horse-riding-simulator was super-fun according to my daughter. Personally I enjoyed the educational ambition and the more physical activities.",
          "As a solo adult visitor I didn't enjoy the museum that much. However, it is well designed and offers great fun if you are a 5 year old. I mostly liked the rainforest and the venomous snake exhibition, where one can see eye to eye with a live rattlesnake. Value for money is also",
          "This tour is something else! Follow the water from mountain down to rain forrest. You can watch a 4 kilo trout at a distance of 5 centimeters and a 3 meter shark over your head. Snakes, spiders and beautiful butterflies. Combine this with one day at Liseberg. They also have good",
          "I just really love the indoor rainforest and the aquarium. But I have to admit, it is pricey. However, if you get the G\u00f6teborg citypass, you can get in for free.",
          "From the moment you enter Universeum, you realise it is not just any ordinary science museum. Passing through the rotating doors, you are confronted by a 4 floor high indoor rainforest, complete with free flying birds and roaming monkeys! After buying your ticket from one of the",
          "While the Universeum can appear to be expensive to visit, once inside it is worth the admission. Every exhibit is top quality. There are fish and birds and sharks and reptiles and every living creature seems to be wonderfully cared for. The \"non living\" exhibits are very",
          "This is an amazing building and the main rain forest attraction quite stunning. lots of exhibitions and a fabulous aquarium",
          "Nice place with amazing information about water world and space. Kids will thoroughly enjoy it. Highly recommended place.",
          "I visited Universeum with my partner on the premise that we would be able to kill a few hours whilst the rain chucked it down outside, and I am so glad we did! Although this place is aimed more at children and young teenagers, we did not struggle to have a really interesting",
          "We came here as a family the morning if our last day before flying home. The kids really enjoyed it, especially the science and sport sections. It well laid out and fun for the family. You can't spend the whole day here as there is not enough to see but as it is next to the",
          "This is a good place to know the nature and specially for kids. Is really interesting place for everyone that like to learn something more.",
          "Spend a day in this great museum with the family. We all had a great time exploring and learning about rainforests, the ice age, the human body ecc. The children got to participate in experiments and decided to become scientists ;)",
          "universeum is a great place for families with children. kids from 2 to 12-13 years can spend the whole day here. there's several thematic areas, a nice aquarium and the really interesting scandinavian river. it's not a place for adults alone. everything is tought for kids",

          "We chose this place because it was a rainy day in Gothenburg and figured it should be interesting. It was, but again, no animals in the rainforest ! This seems to be a common complainant in their reviews. At least they tell you this before you buy your ticket and so you",
          "Literally, it is entire universe in one building. There are several floors dedicated for different themes \u2013 health, astronomy, nature. Many interactive stands and models what you can try. From first look it seems that this place is mostly for kids, but even grown-ups will have",
          "See many things from nature around the world. It is not zoo but full of different Unknown birds, trees. Just amazing",
          "Lots of exhibits which lets visitors take part in their own learning: sleep like an astronaut, watch big fishes and sharks, learn shopping in a working cashregister with barcodereader (for younger kids) and lots of other fun activities. Spent a good five hours here and could",
          "An educating, inspiring and interesting experience for the whole family. Expensive, but if affordable for your family - do pay it a visit!",
          "I was pleasantly surprised. I went in with minimal expectations but the flow of the exhibits and the animals is beyond amazing. You can easily spend hours in there without noticing the passage of time. I would gladly visit it again!",
          "Came here on a day out walking around and I must admit I'm not a fan of stuff like this but it really brings your inner child out walking around looking at animals and learning more about space and health it's much better than anything we have in England as you can interact with",
          "What a great overall museum/attraction. I visited on a Monday afternoon and had the place pretty much to myself. Its easy to navigate around as it leads you through. It houses a huge aquarium, a rain-forest a some interactive exhibits. However when i visited the rain-forest",
          "I have been visiting this place a few times now but this time I have been disappointed by the miss info on certain species. It looks like the place is falling a bit apart :( even though they are under construction I found it sad for the price we paid that they neglect the rest",
          "From aquarium to dinosaurs, there is always something for everyone at Universeum. Lots of hands-on learning activities for kids & adults, plus animals in natural habitats.",
          "You have access to aquarium (the largest section), small reptiles, some scary insects, birds, space ship, training activities and kids playground in one place. This is a nice place for all ages to visit. The reason I rate three is that rain forest was mainly closed when we",
          "We were in Gothenburg for 2 nights and looking for something to do during the day. Universeum was suggested on a few leaflets we had. It did not disappoint, very central and easy to navigate to. There are around I think 6 floors with different animals on each. You could tell",
          "A nice place for everyone that are curious and like to discover a part of the world with sharktank-tunnel to walk through and small stingrays you can touch. A rainforest with monkeys and parrots and a playground for toddler's and adults \ud83d\ude0a",
          "There is so much to see and learn that you could really go there more than once. Some of the activities are in Swedish so for someone not-Swedish-speaking those are not a choice but there is still enough and more. Take enough time and leave your jacket and the stuff you do not",
          "Science and nature-based museum and centre. It is located in wider city centre area. You can experience jungle, science/space area, fish tank. You can take picture with a shark floating over you. Kids will like it, especially when they will be able to try many exhibits",
          "Make sure you go for the whole day... Do the half with the animals, have lunch then do the other science half :) There are family tickets and 2 day tickets.",
          "This is a science/nature-based museum that covers a broad spectrum of subjects. Although the rainforest section was partially closed due to redevelopment, there was plenty else to keep my 13 year old daughter (and myself) entertained. The museum is around a 20-25 minute walk",
          "situated in the centre of Gothenburg . Good aquarium and rainforest area although part was closed for refurbishment , space shuttle area, and other areas also shop and restaurants . plenty access to toilets.",
          "Unverseum is a fantastic place to visit, no matter what age. It is very popular with families as its a great way to educate children but at the same time as an adult experience the wonders of nature not so easily accessible otherwise. Split up in segments you can visit the",
          "I visited Universeum around a week ago and I seriously regret this. I paid full price for a half-closed park. Some fishes, 10 deadly beauties and little more. We visited the whole thing in the blink of an eye, I felt like there was nothing interesting to see. That is not",
          "We have planned to go Universeum up for long time. In the beginning of February we finally got there. We payed a lot for to enter. There are some discounts for student and others, but still it is not cheap. We did not get any information about closure of the wild forest part.",
          "I spend a day here with my boys aged 8 & 10 and had a great day! The kids really enjoyed it, although I was a little worried that they might not be that amused as we've have been to great museums lately (such as Science museum and National History Museum in London) - but I was",
          "Visited here as two twenty something couples and found it slightly underwhelming to be honest. there are lots of different areas but some things aren't clear as to what they are and the amount of hyper children running riot was annoying by the end!! It was good for an afternoon",
          "If you ever plan to spend a day at liseberg, do not miss universum. It has a lot of fun under its roof; aqarium, spacecenter, rainforest, playroom for the smallest and cool tasks for the older kids. This is a place where the kids can learn about animals, fish, plants etc as Well",
          "We had a guided tour and although I went there with very low expectations I was surprised that they have arranged a really well balanced collection of animals, plants and exhibitions. Definitely worth for children. Plan some extra time to stroll through all zones and don't",
          "We were two couples, yet, it was a pleasing experience, alike the kids around were having owing to : 1. Though the aquarium is a small/medium sized, the variety of fish and the display is mesmerizing. I saw the 'saw fish' and other fishes like bluestinger ray for the first",
          "A good array of different displays, done well. Some of the areas are dated but it is clear they are working on improving them. Snakes aren't my thing at all however the snake displays were very impressive. If you are considering a visit, I would recommend holding off until the",
          "Decided to visit as it was one of the few plAces that were open on Good Friday. The layout inside can be a bit confusing but it doesn't really matter that much as every where you end up is interesting. Was joined by husband and two sons (18 and 11) all enjoyed the experiance.",
          "Not a bad museum for children. Some areas were more interesting than others for adults to be involved, for example the health section which was quite interactive. Worth a visit just for the ocean floor to see sharks.",
          "I've visited Universeum 5-6 times with my family and we enjoy it every time. Walking through the jungle watching monekys leap from tree to tree, seeing exotic birds fly around freely... Beautiful butterflies and odd-looking fishes. All this right in the middle of Gothenburg.",
          "I visited with my family. My eldest (17) and youngest (7) enjoyed it a lot. Lots of exhibits. We got the city one card which I think is very practical if you want to utilise it's use for two days which includes ferry, tram and bus rides. Worth a visit if you are ever in",
          "I have been there during a rainy day and it ended up being the best solution. I have enjoyed the butterflies and all the 'inside' vegetation as well as the 'Oceans' part. The rest of the floors not so interesting really. Definitely a place to see if you have children.",
          "A very nice place for the whole family .I really enjoyed it ,suitable for everyone .Nice and different kinds of fish ,really You'll be surprised .Its location is very close to the center station just beside Liseberg amusement park.",
          "What to say... Even though I am interested in wildlife and nature this is just no good. Small, smelly, long wait for everything. Crappy food and not enough restrooms.",
          "First of all, when you entered they already were telling you about some areas being closed because of reforms, but still, the amount that you pay stays the same. Another thing is that it is unbeliavable that a place that cares about knowledge don't make a student discount among",
          "We went here for the first time in 2014, and what a great place. The combination of Zoo where the small monkeys run free and the technical/educational part makes this a place you can spend several hours. First time we visited we spend around 4 hours here. Decided to come back",
          "I originally came to visit the Universeum on the Saturday of my visit but it was crowded with kids so decided to come back on the Monday, especially as it is one of only a few museums that open on a Monday in Gothenburg. There were still quite a lot of kids on school trips but",
          "We're all over 20 att still found it fun. It'sbest if you start at the top and work all the levels down to exit point. There is a nice look out point att the top. If it's nice weather you can take pretty pictures \u263a",
          "It was not as great as I hoped it would be. The coolest part was being able to pet a stingray. It's more for kids, I would say. It was not bad, but we thought the price was too high for what it offered.",
          "The place is still under construction, but the experience is ok for a family day out. Food offerings could have been better, and the value isn't excellent since the rainforest is not ready. Considering half of it is closed down, the price should be reduced. But my kids enjoyed",
          "Located next to Liseberg and hotel Gothia Towers, this zoo/aquarium is Swedens biggest aquarium. Lots of different fish species, but few tropical animals. Lot of construction in the rainforest section which took away some of the experiment.",
          "A place To spendera Time with your kids. Possible To do several tings with differentialekvationer ages On Childen. Live animals to see.",
          "My children and I (12/16) and my sister and her children who live nearby (4/11) all had a very enjoyable day there even though there is major work being undertaken in improving some of the exhibits. Great fun and interesting for all ages.",
          "They are currently remodelling the rain forest so much of this was not open during our visit but even so it was an excellent attraction to visit. We went with our 16 yr old daughter who is animal mad so she really enjoyed it. Many of the areas are probably aimed at younger kids",
          "Really great rainforest. Very kid friendly with knowledgeable staff. Liked the dinosaur exhibit on the roof.",
          "Good fun!Very interactive whilst being subconsciously educational. We spent hours here and we don't even have kids. Well worth a visit.",
          "Excellent was to escape from the cold on a Sunday. Every city should have on. Educational and interesting for children and adults alike. Only the rainforest des appointed but that is being renewed.",
          "We read about this place and listed as a top attraction, but in all honesty had we not had free entry I would have felt disappointed paying to get in, really only have fish to see, saw two monkeys in there abs that was it.",
          "Suitable for all ages and reasonably priced. We visited in winter and got the feeling that summer visits are probably more involved but well worth the visit still.",
          "As I live in Gothenburg I have a pass and we go several times a year. I love the path with \"fishes in their original habitat\", the aquarium, the rainforest, the snakes and spiders and more... And when you have done all that there are always interesting exhibitions where the",
          "If you are in Gothenburg and want to see animals of Sweden and other more exotic places? Or want to learn something new? Drop by universeum :)",
          "This is a very interesting place for both adults and children. Even though some of the segments were closed it was really a great experience.",
          "The museum is big, there are many different rooms with different themes, all with good explanations. The tropical forest is super fun, and I love the aquarium!",
          "Loved the museum. Went in with city pass. Rainforest part closed butbvwe would return so will see it next time.",
          "Sorry but this attraction needs to refresh in its displays and not just leave the same attractions for te next 50 yrs. been there a few times expecting something new. Kids are bored of the place and refuse to go again. For me this could be one of Gothenburg star attractions but",
          "I enjoyed this experience, even though there are better places like this in Europe. It's more suitable for kids than adults",
          "I came here with my sister and a friend visiting Sweden for the first time, excited to see Universeum. I have been to Universeum many times many years ago and I was so excited to see it again but my expectations were to high. Universeum's rainforest was under construction and",
          "As an adult visiting this attraction, I spent an enjoyable couple of hours looking at the aquarium, the snakes, and the space exhibition, so it was worth a visit. It was particularly interesting to learn about Sweden's waterways and their wildlife, and about space exploration",
          "In here you can watch sharks, snakes and other facinating animals. During some times there are guides at the special places and you get to know some funny facts, that more people are killed by cocnuts falling out of trees than by sharks every year. There are several different",
          "My boyfriend and I are in our 20's and both loved this. It's a nice place to walk around seeing all the animals in their different environments. The science floor was interesting too. I would imagine the Universeum would be even better if you take children but we enjoyed it just",
          "I bit tacky, some great marine specimens and huge tanks to see the fish etc. The rain forest was a waste of time.",
          "If you visit Gothenburg with children, take the time to visit Universeum. A lot of educative activities, beautiful aquariums, interesting exhibitions... Highly recommended!",
          "The highlight is by far the aquariums, which are outstanding. We spent the majority of our afternoon just taking in the tanks. However, the rest of the exhibits were remarkably dull in comparison. They were interesting and the kids loved it, but I did expect more from the",
          "Very enjoyable trip to the Universeum where the main attraction is largely aquarium based. Lots to do, especially for kids.",
          "Universeum is perfect for peoples in any age. You can look at fishes, birds, bats and more. They also have a activityroom for kids is any age. A great place to travel with kids.",
          "Visiting in winter 2015 a large part of the museum was closed and tickets were half price but what we saw was great . Kids had lots of fun ad we learnt thigs too - will go again if we get back to Gothenburg another time",
          "This is an educational day out. The aquarium floor is out if this world!! Razor shark, plus many others. Beautiful fish many which I have never seen before. Starfish, sea horses to name a couple. The rain forest area. The mammoth display was very good. The lower floors ; space",
          "Here you can walk in different climates from the mountains down to the rainforest. Also a big aquarium and an experimental department, fun fotr the whole family.",
          "This place can keep a family occupied for a day. No bother. You can learn about space, rainforests, robots and mammoths and get very active testing reflexes and skills. You can build a tower taller than you can reach.. On a par with other Science museums across the World,",
          "We went here with our toddler. There were different exhibits. Some of them were not open when we went there. We had lot of fun in the activity area.",
          "I do not understand why some people write that Universeum is just for chilldren or that it is valuable. I do not agree at all. Thiis museum is fabulous with several floors and a beautiful rain forest and an aquarium. The museum is divided in different sectors ( health, space,",
          "We have visited the Universeum several times over the past few years, and We've loved it every time. It's educational, fun and interesting both for adults and children. The aquariums with creatures small and large give for an educational and almost surreal experience. And the",
          "When we were in universeum, they were redecorating half of universeum, so we payed one ticket for two persons, but it was disappointing, we haven't seen anything new and exciting.",
          "When we walked into this place we were immediately bumped into by 2 kids running around there's some much in here to see and do. Lots of interactive things here and if you've got kids it's a must visit.",
          "This place has been intricately designed to give both Kids and Adults a good deal of knowledge on animals over the water and under water with an absolutely breathtaking aquarium as well as rainforest. The science departments are also very enlightning and pedagogical.",
          "The place has good infrastructure and different attractions and topics that are suitable for children.",
          "A good collection of animal and fishes, and their fish tank is mesmerizing. Easily you can spend an hour just infront of the big Aquarium seeing the fish. It even has replicas of dinoaurs. Facility has food facilities just before entrance and has pram parking facilities and",
          "Universeum is a very nice building and very well organised.. there are resemblances from all different parts like traditional Swedish sea life and tropical rainforests.. doesn't remind you a zoo but mainly an interactive place :)",
          "My husband and I decided to \"do\" Universeum on our own and we did not regret it! It is a fantastic place, extremely well planned and lots to see. The idea of following the water through various climates is brilliant and very educational. Definitely worth the rather steep",
          "A great mix, animals, education, science etc.. all rolled into one. Been a few times, always enjoyable, although it can get a little busy. Better to pre-pay online as the queue for those who want to pay in person on the day can be quite long and arrive early.",
          "Obviously meant for small children, but I took my 15 year old there mainly because we had a Gothenburg card and got in free. We both enjoyed it a lot.",
          "The biggest aquarium in Sweden houses 5 species of sharks, rays as well as coldwater and tropical fish. Interesting facts and staff that caters to kids, leaving them with interesting facts. A bit crowded and pricey, and make sure to leave jackets in downstairs lockers, since the",
          "We went during 1/2 term in October. Our 2 young children (5yrs and 20 months) loved it. Lots of things to do and see all with a science focus. A shame that the next exhibition was not open yet (closed 1/2 a floor) and some items were broken. 7 floors of things to do. The",
          "Amazing experience of nature and science in one place. Aquarium and rain forest with plenty beautiful animals living there you can see and interact.",
          "I went with my 24 year old daughter and we had a fantastic time. We spent most of the time in the aquarium and rain forest attraction. Would highly recommend this for a visit.",
          "Had a brilliant morning at Universeum, especially at the aquarium! Loved the easy to follow layout of the building and the whole rainforest section was amazing!!",
          "A good day out, great variety of things to see and do, possibly aimed at younger kids but enough to entertain our 13 and 10 year old.",
          "I had high expectations when I visited Universum but to me I can only rate it as fairly good. I'v been to other places which were much more interesting and appealing.",
          "This is a great adventure for the kids. We have been several times and my kids love it every time. For such a small city in Sweden this is a terrific museum!",
          "Lots to see, for all. Rainforrest with small monkeys running free, birds flying and butterflies. A nice place to teach children abouth the world around us, but also a place for adults who love nature",
          "With 7 floors to visit & topics as diverse as graphene, space, the rainforest, wooly mammoths and aquatics there's something here for eveyone. This was my 2nd visit to Universeum and it has never failed to impress. Great for all ages and creative activities on the 2nd floor make",
          "Gothenburg on a rainy day can be tough - many of he beat and most exciting experiences are outdoors. But for animal lovers and curious youngsters, the Universeum aquarium and science Centre will amaze and enthrall for hours. A little pricey but worth it for the fun and",
          "Great fun here -nice to spend time in the rainforest area spotting the different animals and insects. Good interactive areas -although more aimed at children it was still interesting."

          "We visited here before returning to our cruise ship as it was just outside the ship. It was a lovely hour spent there, very interesting and many exhibits to view including the Volvo Ocean Race exhibits which was in a separate part.Especially loved the lego car! We thoroughly",
          "I have visited this museum, as I am interested in VOLVO. It t\\is not very big museum, but very nice inside. All the cars are in perfect condition. Also, there is a room for VOLVO Ocean Race and for VOLVO Trucks. The shop on the entrance is not very big. It is situated in 2",
          "Due to a miscommunication regarding bus/tram lines we actually ended up at the Volvo Museum by accident. It ended up being a happy accident. Seeing all of the old Volvos and the many different ways in which their vehicles are used was interesting. I would probably rate the",
          "We had just taken delivery of our new Volvo, so it only made sense to go to the Volvo museum. Nice building on the waterfront. We made our way inside, and immediate took interest in the trucks. Doing so, it seems, allowed us to skip the entrance (and maybe an entrance fee). We",
          "Very interesting museum, not only for people who are interesting in manufacturing. A little of Swedish history.",
          "Great place to visit for Volvo fans! Also the Volvo merchandise shop offers many great items to buy.",
          "I have to start by saying that my wife and I have loved our Volvos, so much so that we decided to pickup our newest XC90 at it\u2019s birthplace in Gothenburg, Sweden. After being presented with our new car, lunch at the plant, and a factory tour what could be better than a visit to",
          "The Volvo museum shows a piece of Swenens modern history. Most swedish people have a very tight and emotional connection to Volvo. Many have owned a Volvo car or have worked for the company, and Volvo has played a very imortant role for the buildong of the modern Sweden during",
          "It's a nice museum with at lot of different Volvo cars. I was lucky and found a copy of the PV544 from 1965 which was my first car - got it from my granddad. Even the same color. It's not very centrally located - it's out in the old shipyard area called Arendal. You need to",
          "Worth visiting! The museum offers great insight of the history of the brand and the present time, but in contrast the innovation area is unimpressive. There is a good area with many activities for kids. The cafe could be improved :-)",
          "We were in a hurry so could not do justice to the exhibition. However, the way the vehicles were laid out made it easy and most interesting to follow the history and progression of the brand from its inception to today's offerings. A great brand and a must see when you visit",
          "What an experience to go to a museum that is full of the most fantastic vehicles , not only of a bygone era but current as well. Well run, interesting and as one would expect of the Swedes, spotlessly clean.The staff were friendly and really helpful",
          "Excellent day out for an enthusiast, the museum is quite large, there's parking and a cafe on site. Worth the 15 minute drive from Gothenburg. The focus is very much on Volvos from the past, there could be a bit more about the present day product development and factory. Overall",
          "I am not a huge car enthusiast but my husband loves cars. We toured this museum at the factory in Gothenburg Sweden. I was truly fascinating. I discovered how many other things Volvo is into other than cars. As an uninformed visitor my eyes were opened in a very pleasant manner.",
          "Fabulous to see so many old Volvo cars in one place, and find out about all the safety changes that Volvo pioneered in the car industry. Learnt a lot about Volvo extreme boat racing, and saw a LOT of old cars. Concept futuristic cars and service vehicles (at end) particularly",
          "The museum is right beside the Cruisec Ship docking point and well worth a trip down memory lane for the older generation. Saw a number of Volvo's that brought back memories. Well worth the time and effort",
          "It only takes about an hour to go through the museum, but we really enjoyed ourselves. My daughter was able to climb into the big rig trucks and sit in the drivers seat, we were able to climb onto the old fire truck, and the lego Volvo was a great addition! Loved seeing the",
          "Informative, well laid out museum, good information on the companies history. Could possibly benefit from more interactive exibits. Transport to and from the museum was easy.",
          "To be honest I wasn't too excited about visiting here as I'm not really a car enthusiast, however I was very pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed the interactive aspects like being able to get in the trucks and buses and found the history very interesting. My boyfriend loved",
          "It was most engaging to see the evolution of Volvo and some of the truly beautiful classic designs. A true wonder was seeing a Volvo XC90 made completely out of LEGO bricks. Built on an actual XC90 frame, a total of 201,076 LEGO bricks were put together, one-at-a-time!",
          "We enjoyed our visit here!!! Learned about the history of the company and the many automotive products that it has produced since its inception. The Volvo Ocean Race is also a part of the museum. Really nice and great addition to the museum.",

          "Great museum with so many things to see and exciting facts of all kinds. Both on cars, trucks, machine, Ocean Race etc. Children at 8 and 10 also enjoyed more than three hours in this museum. After this visit we love our Volvo a bit more.",
          "An interesting museum to visit. Pride of Gothenburg. I have never seen soooo many different Volvos of different eras in 1 place. There was a real size Lego Volvo in the museum too. A rich collection.",
          "The museum has the history of Volvo group right from 1927 with the vehicles preserved carefully. Also has Volvo merchandise of wide variety but really expensive!",
          "It was OK. I'm not a Volvo driver or an aficionado, but I went anyway. Kind of informative but a little bland for my taste",
          "It is interesting and exciting to see the array of Volvos since 1927. The display are well done and well annotated.",
          "I dragged my long-suffering fianc\u00e9 along to the Volvo Museum during our recent trip to this wonderful city. Staff were friendly, and we gained entry using our Gothenburg City Card (well worth a look if you're planning on visiting many of the attractions here!). A totally",
          "Whether or not you're in Torslanda near Gothenburg to take delivery of a new Volvo, the Volvo Museum is worth a visit to appreciate the auto maker's long history of making cars and trucks. Admission is free for customers who have picked up their new Volvos from the nearby",
          "The museum is interesting for all visitors. Even women can find it attractive and informative. History, invetions, evolution, tentative models - involving exposition. Children can get into the cars and boats, drive them and play. You can spend there several hours without getting",
          "Interesting exhibit of Volvo cars, trucks, buses and marine engines. Mostly cars though. Not a very large museum, which is actually nice, but has loads of cars in it. A must-see for car & Volvo enthusiasts.",

          "First off, I'm not a car addict and my interest in such is quite low but I did enjoy the Volvo Museum. For those of you with a keen interest in the automotive history, safety, Volvo in general, Volvo Ocean Race etc. this is exactly what you're looking for. The place is",
          "Although I'm not a car addict, I really liked this place. There is a lot to see for Volvo lovers and for the other tourist who likes a journey back in time. BUT: in July 2017 the place was extremely hard to find by ...car. A member of our group had visited the museum half a year",
          "We came over for VROM 2017 and visited the museum twice during our stay in Gothenburg. Plenty to see, with cars on display from the first Volvo production, 90 years ago. Really well displayed. Trucks, specialised vehicles, coaches etc also on show. I found the section with the",

          "This a modern museum showing everything about Volvo from its start to the last models, (including those that were never commercialized). there is also a section on the Volvo sailing race as well as on the marine engines and the trucks. Quite interesting although very classical",
          "We bought a Volvo so our entry was free. We enjoyed the history of the company and there were numerous examples of early vehicles (cars, buses, boats) along with many design firsts in later vehicles. Large trucks, jet aircraft, and tour buses were there as well. Lots to see.",
          "We went to the museum using our weekly pass which is free for transports, museums and boat rides. We had to book well before at the tourist office before you travel to the museum, as a special transport needs to be booked. I was amazed by all the motors- ranging from very old",
          "Visited here while picking up a new Volvo, before traveling to Italy...very nice and interesting tour of the factory with the museum stop before, many classic Volvo's on display in their grandeur! Little merchandise shoppe too.",
          "This museum is very organise, a different models of cars, nice building, awesome crew. Best place to visit..",
          "I didnt have a clue Volvo made this many models, very nice museum. A must visit if you have even the smallest interest of cars.",
          "Firstly, this museum is very beautiful at a quay in Arendal. When you enter the museum you will find it well organized where you can follow Volvo's development from the beginning until today's Volvo cars. You walk a loop and get to know all models and technology development",
          "My girlfriend and I have been there during our stay in Gothenburg and it was very interesting and informative. The way to get there from the city centre is a bit tricky but other than that it's very recommendable.",
          "As car museums go, it was pretty good. No tours were available or offered to us and, as it was a Sunday, no option for a factory tour. Relying on public transport was a nightmare as you have to ring and book the local bus service an hour in advance to pick you up at the stop.",
          "We have been to many car museums, both grand and small, around the world and expected great things from Volvo. If you are a car or Volvo enthusiast, as we consider ourselves to be, then you will feel that your efforts to reach this museum were worth it. It is a good drive out of",
          "A lot of cars showed over the decades of swedish development. Not only cars but also engines, trucks, ships and even more... Also you can extend your visit to the shop where you can find a lot interesting things to remember about your visit here: cars models, clocks, clothes etc",
          "The primary purpose for my visit to Gothenburg was to Visit Volvo for the factory tour and this museum. As a \"young\" Volvo driver many of the classic cars such as the Amazon I have never seen in person so it was interesting to see them for real. The museum is a good size, it",
          "The museum itself is a must visit for automobile fan especially Volvo fan. They ve extensive collections of cars inclusive of concept cars, vintage and many more. Their yacht also on display. However, going there is a bit troublesome. You would need to book the feeder bus to go",
          "Need a car to get here really As it's a long way out of Gothenburg. There is quite a lot to see here and if you are a real car aficionado you could spend longer than the 90 mins we were. It was a good place to visit to keep out of the rain.",
          "It is best if you drive to Volvo Museum as opposed to public transport. It is out of the way, but not far away for a drive. The museum is intetesting. However, not impressing me. The history of Volvo cars and manufacturing is reasonably well covered. No, interesting stories for",
          "Book a transfer if you visit the museum on the weekend. (And if you do not arrive by car) The exhibition is impressive, even you do not interested in cars, there is a huge amount of information about swedish culture hidden in the descriptions. Interaktive enough for kids to",
          "The museum isn't easy to get to at the weekends as you have to ring and request the bus to pick you up from the tram/bus station, but it is worth the effort. The museum is modern, spacious and full of a range of cars, buses and trucks, which were well looked after. You should",
          "We visited this museum, which is a bit out of the way to get to from central Gothenburg, and it was well worth the journey. It is a 15 min tram ride and then a 15 min bus ride. The museum is in an industrial part of the harbour. The exhibits were extensive and the entire range",
          "we've been at the volvo museum in may 2017, on the sunday after running the g\u00f6teborg half marathon. very nice museum with so many great volvo's. in general there are too many cars on too small space, a pity. would be nice if it would give more space to the cars.",
          "The museum, for us , was fantastic. We were in Gothenburg for a Volvo Penta marine experience/meeting and made a pre-trip visit to the museum. 1.25 to 2.0 hours would be normal. If you are a Volvo aficionado you will appreciate the layout, pay particular attention to",
          "This museum offers an interesting history of the Volvo company. They display many early models of Volvo cars and trucks.",
          "It was interesting to see the progression of Volvo's design and get a little bit of history. The space felt a bit dated and I left feeling like a factory tour would have been more interesting",
          "Wow. We bought a new Volvo and came to pick it up at the factory. This museum is impressive and had way more info than we could absorb in an hour or two. If you're a Volvo nut then plan on spending several hours. It was fun for us all to walk through the generations of old",
          "Super happy I had rented a car (a Volvo no less) because it takes a bit of doing to get to the museum, if you don't have a car (I know, right?). It was totally worth it, though Totally. I'm not 'into cars' nor am I a Volvo fanatic, but I still had a blast and learned more than I",
          "This is out of the city and u need an car to visit this place. The museum is huge and with lot of information and real cards for showcase. i am not a car lover hence it was average visit for me.",
          "An amazing set of lovely volvo cars, including some restores gems and some awesome study models. You can walk around your self, don't miss the upper floor!",
          "The day i visited i was the only person there for about 4 hours maybe because this was during working hours. It wasn't too hard to find one bus from Gothenburg central which drops you off in an industrial area but its very well sign posted. If your interested in cars this will",
          "My wife and I spent over five hours in the museum and relived our 42 year love affair with Volvo. In 1974 we drove a 1971 142 across Canada, more than 3000 miles before arriving in Vancouver. Next was a 1973 144 that we kept for 15 years as a daily driver and week-end rally car.",
          "Wonderful museum (with a very helpful staff). I'd planned ca. 1h visit but I enjoyed it for 2,5 h. I deeply recommend to visit this place while being in Gothenborg :) PS> for all Golf lovers: there is a Volvo Cup golf simulator inside :))) it was a beautiful surprise to have an",
          "this is the history of one of the worlds most famous brands in the car industry, not only cars here are buses, boat engines, trucks etc etc take the time to visit this place",
          "The Volvo museum consisted of Volvos from different years. In my opinion, the museum could be a bit more interactive. If you are really into cars, surely the museum is interesting. If you are not into cars, it is just bunch of Volvos. The location is a bit inconvenient, and it's",
          "The museum is far away from the city area & it is in industrial suburb. You need to plan your commute in advance. Good collection of cars & other equipment manufactured by Volvo since their inception. Especially the concept cars & green bus are worth seeing. Well planned &",
          "Spent a few hours in the museum. It was quiet and entertaining. I enjoyed viewing the cars, big trucks and engines. Particularly it was nice to see a progression of vehicles that were produced over the years.",
          "It's not just the cars that are on show. Interesting to see ones you have seen in the past. There was building work going on so reception/cafe facility not 100% but free coffee to apologise. A well spent SEK100, although when following the signs to the Museum we took a couple of",
          "We checked with our hotel front desk on how to get to the museum by tram, they checked the Volvo museum website and gave me the information. We get there and the museum is closed due to some maintenance, so guess what I wasn't happy. I was really looking forward to seeing it",
          "We were in the Volvo Museum and it is just awesome. One gets to know a lot of Volvo history and can see old models and even former concept cars. Good background info on the company's history is provided as well. However, to get there is not easy. It is outside Gothenburg and",
          "Good for a couple of hours visit. Well laid out with a host of Volvo cars, trucks and engines over the decades. Good informative notes by the displays.",
          "We visited the museum before turning our new car into the factory after an overseas delivery. My first car was a 1967 Volvo, and I was amazed to see an identical car here. The museum traces the history of Volvo, and they have examples of most cars that they have produced.",
          "I recently purchased my first Volvo 6 months ago and have brought it with me to Sweden whilst I am temporarily working here. I was convinced by a family member to buy one as he himself is an enthusiast to say the least. I can honestly say I appreciate the Swedish design and",
          "Apart from the part where you could see these awesome nice old Volvo cars, there was a hands-on experience where you could climb inside Volvo ocean ship, try a Volvo Ocean ship simulator, drive a radio controlled car, throw darts, try to fall over in a truck etc. Great that you",
          "We visited two years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. This time we allowed more time and enjoyed our visit even more. If your on a cruise and dock at the \" Arundel\" wharf, you are right next to the museum. It's more expensive than at our last visit, but still great value for",
          "Knowing that Volvo is known for its sensible, safe driving machines we didn't expect a lot from the museum. As a matter of fact, the only reason we toured the museum was because the line for buses to town from our ship was so long we figured we might as well check out the museum",
          "This is a great place to visit for car fans. You will need a car or get the bus to reach the museum. Great for families too.",
          "Perfect museum of Volvo both cars, trucks and boats. There is an small shop with Volvo merchandise and souvenirs.",
          "I reluctantly joined my husband on a visit to the Volvo Museum but was glad I did ! This Museum not only includes the history of the Volvo cars, trucks and buses and green energy over the year that one would expect but much, much more. There is a whole section on the Volvo Ocean",
          "This is a great place to see how Volvo started and some of the innovative ideas they have had over the years, you can get refreshments there too. We walked along to the Marina where 2 ocean race yachts were moored, great place definitely worth a look.",
          "We visited this wonderful museum in the last week of September.Free access due to Gothenburg city card. Located in Arendal area can be reached through public bus which run on limited time frequency. It is advisable to check timetable for to & fro during planning. Good insights",
          "Very cool and interesting place to visit.In Gothenburg I was the first time and I could not leave such a place. In particular, when I worked in an international corporation like Volvo. A place that will tell the story, and a wide range of productive segment companies such as",
          "If you arrive by cruise ship you can see this museum from the ship. Before you take the shuttle bus to town or after you come back this is a great one hour attraction. There is a good history of the company and many beautifully restored older models on display. There is a",
          "A great place to go to to educate yourself on Swedish automotive industry. Sadly it has been exported/sold away. this museum however is well worth a visit to see and learn about the history of Volvo.",
          "This is really a nice place to visit in Gothenburg. Not very big, not very fancy, but soo interesting. A lot of nice cars, but also other historical stuff intimately connected with the modern Swedish history. A museum for all ages.",
          "A very nice collection of Volvo products from over the years. Mostly of cars and some trucks (older years and some new products as diesel trucks). You can learn of Volvo, its founders, the company philosophy over time, and how they became so safety conscious. An easy walking",
          "Make sure to find out how to get here from the city. It is a long bus ride out. But once you get here, you will be awed by the collection. I know I was. I came with my mom and sister because dad had a convention. We spent almost 2 hours here because the place was huge with",
          "Visited the Volvo museum as recommended by the Goteburg City Card. Vast selection of cars going back to when the Volvo was first produced right up to the present day. I found the 80/90's cars the most interesting as it reminded me of my childhood. The museum is quite large and",
          "Visited the Volvo museum a few years ago on a business trip to Gothenburg and was very impressed with the level of detail and history on display for Volvo. It also wasn't overly long either making it possible to complete within 2 hours if you're keen. A great day out if you're a",
          "Not bad but not worth it you are not a Volvo fan. You will be hit with a bit of nostalgia when you see the old school cars and trucks. The history about car safety is pretty cool. Especially the fact that Volvo invented some of the safety features that we use today like seat",
          "Interesting museum about Volvos history and future. Spent 3 hrs. Also for kids interesting. Volvo ocean race exhibition was great!",

          "I have fond childhood memories of our old family Volvo so was always keen to visit this museum. We travelled by public transport from Gothenburg which was easy but took just under an hour. Well worth the visit but I left feeling it could offer a little more. It would be nice to",
          "The day we visited this museum did not start well as the travel to get there was quite a fiasco. The museum is out if the city centre so plan ahead as it takes a while to get there. However once arrived we surprised ourselves by being most engaged by the yachting section and",
          "A must visit place if you are a Volvo fan! It takes you from the birth and evolution of Volvo cars/trucks to the state they are in now! The full scale Lego model was mind blowing!",
          "I visited this modest museum in Gothenburg this summer. Its a nice building on the volvo grounds on the waterfront. There is free parking. The cars are presented in chronological order. Its very cool to see all the prototypes that didn't make it into production. At the end of",

          "A great museum not only for those interested in wheels. You can take part of the history and making of rescue vehicles, trucks, tractors. You can see a range of original one-of concept cars and much more. Make sure you stop by the YCC, Your Concept Car on the top level facing",
          "Went to accompany some friends and was quite impressed with the history and presentation of the cars. Small cafe and shop offer some interesting options for a break at the end. Easy to access with public transportation",
          "It's definitely an interesting place to visit especially if you like the brand. I wanted there to be more station wagons but that's just me. Aside from that it shows you a significant lineup and history of their cars. The only down side to this museum is its location. Although",
          "We visited the Volvo Museum when we picked up our new Volvo through the overseas delivery program. We really wanted to tour the factory but could not because it was closed for summer vacation. The museum was interesting and entertaining. My husband enjoyed the \"car\" stuff. I",

          "Volvo history and lots of restored vehicles including many prototypes never seen or knew of before coming. Trucks, military and construction divisions represented as well. A few non-auto vehicles to sit in. Only had 90 minutes but could have made a day of it. If a Volvo",
          "The Museum is just next to the Cruise ship terminal, making easy to walk to. It displayed the history on Volvo car, truck, aircraft makings. It is a nostalgic tour if you owned the Volvo cars from the 60's.",
          "What I liked: * The cars display was interesting to observe, nice history timeline to see the evolution of the brand * Interactive part in the museum is 30% - you can hop on on some buses and touch buttons, children can hop in truck driving seats and press buttons * Sailing",

          "I didn't realize volvo made so many different vehicles than just cars. Yiu see whole variety and learn about history of company. Not very interactive but there is video and signs on all vehicles in collection so you can get feel for all they do.",
          "If you like old cars and there history it's a great museum for you To see the history of the production of a car and to appreciate the beauty of the volvo cars",
          "This museum is situated in between the Energy harbour and the RoRo terminal in Arendal. This is close to the main Volvo factory. Here you can see old and newer Volvo cars and there development.",
          "The Volvo Museum is for car enthusiasts (I can't think why anyone who wasn't a car enthusiast would go here). It's a comprehensive history of Volvo with some beautiful vehicles including concept cars that never got made. If you like trucks, you'll love that part too. Perhaps",
          "If you love cars and want to see a whole bunch of Volvo's from day 1 then this is it. Additional rooms of water and aviation make it more interesting with bonus interactive displays which I am sure children would enjoy. Prices for souvenirs are pricey. wifi only available if",
          "If you are a Volvo enthousiast and/or you are interested in the technology of cars and marine drives the Volvo museum is a must-see. The complete car-program of nearly a 100 years of Volvo is shown and the technology is very clearly shown. Lost of models and engines are",
          "When I was visited, they spent good amount space for volvo ocean race. Permanent display includes truck, bus as well as penta heavy duty stuff as well. Unlike volvo cars delivery center which is about 5 Km away, gift shop here heavily focused on truck/penta realted items.",
          "We spent a few hours at the Volvo Museum. We wandered through the extensive collection, each at our own pace, and all got something out of it. Our 12 year old and 16 year old got through first, and enjoyed some ice cream at the small snack bar. My husband took the longest, as he",
          "If you or your kids get crazy about cars or trucks is is the place for you! A comprehensive collection of Volvo vehicles. You can climb on some of them. The cafeteria is little bit convenient since it can be rather windy and/or rainy out side. Besides, you can get nice Vovlo",
          "Interesting afternoon out, particularly if you are into volvos. A little out of the way and if weekend, then you need to 'order' a return bus at reception on arrival. Plenty of cars buses and trucks, even a plane. Tenner per person, and not bad cafe, plenty o souvenirs at",
          "Having two sons who work for Volvo, this museum was really an eye-opener on the excellent craftsmanship and design of Volvo through the years. Not just cars, but buses and large equipment.",
          "Interesting museum with Volvo cars and trucks from early 20th century to new concept cars. Plenty of space and good with kids as there are several cars and trucks your allowed to enter. Also a part on Volvo ocean race (sailing). Drawback can be that it's very off and you need",
          "Interesting and nicely laid out. There are dozens of actual volvos from all periods of history. English friendly. Worth a stop. Also don't miss the factory tour nearby in Gothenburg.",
          "If you visit Gothenburg, Volvo car museum is a must see for a car enthusiast. Its a little far from the city, but public transport is available.",
          "This was the most beautiful museum, which you have visited during our stay in Gothenburg. I recommend every visitor ...",
          "Volvo Museum is a bit far out but easily accessed by public transport. Bus 128 from Nordstan or bus 32 from Eketr\u00e4gatan takes you straight there in 20 minutes. A wide variety of motorised vehicles dating back to the beginning of Volvo. You will find anything from service",
          "When you own a 30 year old Volvo, this visit is worth it! Great historical overview of Volvo cars and trucks plus a wonderful Volvo constructed completely of Legos. Museum is on the water, so also a chance to see a completely different area of Gothenburg. Easy to access on",
          "Once you find this museum, it is very interesting with a wide range of exhibits, but make sure you have clear directions as the signposting on the roads is very poor",
          "A brilliant experience everyone has to try it by himself/herself . I had a doubt that this place is for men only but the truth it is not it's for everyone . A different thing to try but amazing one .",
          "Glad we went & would recommend. Watch the video in the auditorium at the start (get the staff to put it on). Gives full Volvo history. A good history of Volvo cars in the museum with some real blasts from the past. A whole section on yacht racing stuff, lots of trucks & boat",
          "Firstly, people should be aware of the need to telephone for the bus at the weekend during the winter (no mention of this in the otherwise excellent City Card leaflet). We were advised that the trip would take an hour and a half to two hours. I think that was an over estimate",
          "I had a great time at this museum. Great piece of Volvo history, from classic cars, to modern cars and concepts. I have spend couple hours in here easily. It is quite remote from a city center, however there is a public transportation to and from you can use. It takes about",
          "We didn't actually make it here, not for the effort of trying but I thought other people should be aware of potential transport difficulties. We tried to go on a Sunday and followed the transport routes as outline in their brochure. The tram was fine but when we went to change",
          "This was a very interesting trip, seeing the history of Volvo and how the design evolved. I am not a car fan, but it was still cool to see how things used to be, up close. You can even step up to a big truck and look inside, which I thought was cool too. It's a great place for",
          "We had planned on coming here once we had booked our weekend to Gothenburg. We were using public transport and had failed to read the information about the bus linking the tram stop and the museum. So if you're planning to do this journey at the weekend (helpful vote!) you need",
          "I'm not a massive car fan but can appreciate them, however my partner loves them. We were only there for an hour and a half but it wasn't long enough for us at all. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, so I wouldn't be put off by it if you're not the biggest volvo/mechanics",
          "With a bit of searching you can easily get to this museum with public transport, should you not have a car and it's worth every effort. Here you will find a rich selection of the Volvo history with examples from in principle every decade of this companys great history. You even",
          "Volvo-museum is just great! They change collection time to time and there is always something new to see. If you are into cars, you are into this museum.",
          "We are from Scotland and I have always been Volvo daft, having owned 2 V40 sports, 08 C70 T5 sport Lux and currently 2 V70Rs and S60 D5. My wife surprised me with two plane tickets so that I can go to the museum for my 30th birthday. I really did enjoy it , I even spied the new",
          "A bit difficult to find, but well signed, we visited the Volvo Museum. What a great place, with lots of cars from past to future. There also is a Volvo built completely out of Lego! Very nice for the whole family.",
          "Just visited the Volvo museum in Gothenburg with my girlfriend Lynette we had a wonderful time it was for her birthday 42nd birthday she really enjoyed it never done in her life she told me although she may have been lying but anyway I really enjoyed doing it for her birthday",
          "Tastefully done museum with a lot of interesting Volvo history. Recommended even for non-auto enthusiasts and great for families.",
          "Its good simple museum of the old school, telling you the history of Volvo and not seeking to be a place for divourced fathers to take their teenage children when its their turn to have them. Could and should be bigger to do justice to Volvo history, would also like to see them",
          "Museum is located near sea and closed on Mondays and usually open 10 AM to 5 PM except weekends. It has paid entry. As expected, museum is a insight into history of iconic car models and technology by Volvo. It has excellent collection of cars, trucks and construction",
          "A world of iconic car models, innovations and imaginative prototypes. At Volvo Museum you can take a trip through Volvo\u2019s history since the very beginning. Wide range of passenger cars, buses and heavy trucks as well as marine engines and construction equipment. It is not",
          "This museum has an extensive display of Volvos as well as a historical tour of the iconic car brand. There is also an Around the World Yacht Race display and Golf attraction.",
          "The museum is located a bit outside the city center but well connected with busses. The show area is bib and it takes at least a couple of hours if you want to read all the information and watch all movies. There are Volvo cars from the first model to the laterst state of the",
          "Not nearby city center but very easy to find by public transport Awesome museum, specially for cars/engineer lovers.",
          "The museum shows various cars and trucks and even boat engines all through the history of Volvo. Nice museum, but it is located a bit apart from the city on the Volvo company campus. Worth a visit in my opinion.",
          "Firstly this place is out of town and hard to get to on public transport! Loads of vehicles and a few interactive features..has the potential to be really good but needs something more. More interactive features would be great and also wod have loved to have aeen exactly how a",
          "Me and my friend went to this museum and really enjoyed it's great :-) playing a bit of indoor golf and looking at cool vehicles . What really made it though was the really kind older lady at the cafe / reception area helping us with where to go to eat and also given us all you",
          "One of the best motor vehicle museums I have ever been to any where. They have most of the vehicles that Volvo has produced. The museum is very popular and can be very busy at most times. I never knew that Volvo made fighter planes until I visited the museum. Highly recommend",
          "this is the most unique museum of sweden i believe. all about the revelation of the cars. with one visit you can easily understand the evolution of the automobiles.",
          "A very good informative museum, a bit way out of town, a tram and a bus ride, we had City Cards so no cost to get there and free entry.",
          "Important notice: this museum is not close to the center. To reach Volvo museum, tourists should take a tram from the center to the tram stop Eketragatan and after that, take a bus ( you should book this bus, because it has limited seats). Volvo museum has two floors, it is full",
          "The Volvo museum has a piece of everything, history, safety, cars, airplanes, among others. It is a nice activity, interesting and tells you everything about volvo, if you arrive by a cruise ship it is right beside the port, at least in Royal Caribbean, it takes like 20-30 from",
          "We recently picked up a Volvo in Gothenburg and had some time to spend in the Volvo headquarters region. We found the Volvo Museum and went in with little expectations. However, we were very impressed with the collection of Volvo cars throughout the museum as well as their",
          "All right guys! As you know, I am living here in Gothenburg right now, and I like to visit something about the city every week. Now, is the turn of the VOLVO MUSEUM. Entry fees 100sek, or 80sek if you are student. From my perspective, there is nothing special in this",
          "Here you can find Volvo's history and a good number of models from old times to now. Not only cars are exhibited, but trucks as well and other machinery, as Volvo is a key actor in the truck business worldwide. The location is not central, so the best way to get there is by car.",
          "Very nice to see the various models of Volvo Cars. Proud to be an employee of Volvo and I extremely happy that I was able to visit this museum and experience it.",
          "Cruise ships don't wait for good weather, so our one day visit to Gothenburg was dreary, intermittent rain, plus our first experience of banks that don't handle money; no people interface for day to day banking. ATM is the only way to get cash! Returned to our ship early and",
          "If you want to see the history of Volvo and more Volvo cars, trucks, planes, construction equipment than you ever thought they made, then this is the place for you. Easily spent 3 to 4 hours looking through all of the exhibits!",
          "Museum has cars from different time periods of Volvo history. Old cars were the most interesting for me. All the cars are accompanied with a historical tablet both in swedish and english.",
          "A must see if you are interested in cars or automobile history, Follow Volvo's history from it's formation to present day. It's innovations and concepts also it's marine engines and yacht racing.",
          "Really is something you have to do visiting Gothenburg. Its a great Swedish Story to witness, you will be surprised of just how much Volvo has been and still is.",
          "Are you interested in car history? Then the volvo museum is made for you. You\u00b4ll find it at arendal skans on the south side of Goeta elf. You are able to get here by bus 32, 128 and 184. You get of the bus by Arendals skans and then walk south to the water. The museum is",
          "This has to be one of the best car museums, it not only displays the fascinating history of Volvo and its products, but also includes a full size Lego Volvo XC90 and a prototype car designed exclusively by women. There is an especially interesting section devoted to the Volvo",
          "Amazing museum but a bit dislike because now owned by Chinese guy but always be a fan of Volvo. take it back, please.",
          "Husband is a Volvo enthusiast and visiting this museum was high on his list for a very long time and I enjoyed thoroughly too - had lots of old classic cars and short stories behind each of them then there was trucks and aeroplanes and even the ocean race section which was",
          "I think this is a very interesting museum, even if you are not that interested in cars. It includes history since you can see the different models of cars since the start of Volvo in 1927. You can also see the P1800 that was used in the TV-serie \"The Saint\" with Roger Moore.",
          "Complete collection of all historical Volvos, cars as well as heavy vehicles. Often not crowded. Priceworthy as well",
          "The museum has alot of interesting exhibits and the information panels (fortunately in both Swedish and English) are well-written. Getting there by public transport can be abit of a challenge. We took bus number 290 from the Central railway station to Sorredsvagen and then bus",
          "A short tram & bus ride from the center of Gothenburg If you like cars it is well worth a visit If you like Volvos all the better. A history of the beginning of Volvo with many old cars on display. Volvo means \"I roll\" The most interesting section is the development of new cars,",
          "Nice transport museum,the cars and other vehicles nicely displayed and not crowded together so you can view them easily and at leasure it was not busy the day we were there. The cars are all in fantastic condition and displays the history of the company and the vehicles without",
          "If you like volvo history the museum cannot be missed. Cars, trucks, prototypes, engines, memorabilia, models, a good shop and a caf\u00e8, all on a lovely riverside. A huge room is dedicated to the ocean race.",
          "Spacious and very well presented. Great to see som many concept cars and design studies that never made it in to production. I also like that there are sections with Volvo Penta, Volvo Trucks and Construction Equipment. A bit disappointed with the \"Shop\" though. Not a lot to",
          "You can see everything that has happened to Volvo cars during the years way back to the very beginning. From the founders' desk to James Bond's cars. It's a small museum, but has hundreds of Volvo cars from way back, so a must for the Volvo enthusiast! My son - then 3-5 years",
          "Had a great time seeing this museum and learning about Volvo. As a Volvo owner, we were excited to see all of their products and learn about their history. They have an amazing history and are a very diverse company. They have so many antique cars and have a great facility.",
          "Not a large museum but certainly worth it for the car enthusiast. Volvo's from throughout the years as well as information about the Ocean Race and the history of Volvo.",
          "Our cruise ship tied up right next to this place, so we wandered in after returning from the city. Very interesting. Clean and well organized. Neither my wife nor I are car buffs particularly, but we both enjoyed the history and the concept cars and the general presentation.",
          "A little far from the center of Gothenburg but easily accessible by car. You will be able to see all the historical models that Volvo made (Cars, Trucks, Construction Vehicles, Military, etc) and some concept cars that never got released as well as concept cars for actual models",
          "Historical development of the brand is impressively described in a well designed facility. Every milestone of well known models are exhibited in museum. my son loved a lot..",
          "This is the official Volvo Museum located only a few miles/kilometers from Volvos main production plant. The airy and easily accessible museum has the history of the company on show. There are trucks, excavators, tractors and more among the heavy equipment vehicles. You will see",
          "we received free admission to the museum with our overseas delivery of our new Volvo. I really didn't think I would enjoy a car museum...but I was wrong! The car manufacturers history was interesting and it was awesome to see the Volvo Ocean Race exhibit. The XC90 made out of",
          "Nice museum chronicalling the history of volvo motor vehicles in all shapes and sizes. Don't expect big entertainment for the kids.",
          "As an avid Volvo fan and lifelong owner our expectations were probably too high. This is not a museum but simply a chronological exhibition. Come on guys, please; hire some professional top-experts and turn this into something truly and totally awesome. Right now I was really",
          "Something you kinda have to see, when in Sweden. The museum is in two levels, so you need to take the lift or escalator. Easy access. In a remote industrial area outside Gothenburg. Not great to bring kids to in my opinion, even though they have made some effort to be more kid",
          "As a current owner of a 1961,2005 and 2015 Volvo we were anxious to see this presentation. First Class in all respects. Cars, trucks heavy equipment, boats. The ocean racing exhibit was awesome.",
          "I truly enjoyed this museum especially looking at all the older cars and trucks that had been restored. I also learned a lot about the company. Very interesting.",
          "Lots of interesting exhibits if you're into Volvo's (I'm not!) and whilst it's well worth a visit it just reinforced my views of what boring cars Volvo make!",
          "Really worth visiting if you are interested in the history of Swedish cars. The factory tour is alos worth takin. Good to show your kids",
          "If you are a Volvo aficionado, this is the place for you. The collection ranges from some magnificent examples of the early years through the cars that never made production to all the favourites through the years. If you have small kids, the children's section is good, basic",
          "Visited the museum for free after pricking up a new car from the Volvo Delivery Center up the street. The museum is your typical car museum... starts off with a film about the founding and evolution of Volvo through the years, and discusses Volvo's commitment to safety. Then",
          "We enjoyed strolling through the museum. We were in town to do the Overseas Factory Delivery for our new Volvo and they gave us tickets to check out the museum. It was interesting to see all the old cars and how much has changed in not that long amount of time.",
          "I did enjoy the time I spent in the museum. Was a bit difficult to get there, but it is not a mission impossible as there is a bus an also you could get a boat trip to get there too. The museum itself was really quality, close to the factory, and it guides you through from the",
          "Not easy to get to but worth the trip upon arrival. Obviously a specialised thing but worth going. Staff were very helpful upon arrival and arranged a bus to pick us up on hour and half as it was a Sunday.",
          "In order to understand Volvo, you need to visit Sweden. And when visiting Sweden to miss the Volvo museum might be a great miss. The museum was extended a bit in the last few years. It is not a big fancy and shine industrial museum, but shows in good simple way the Volvo way,",
          "I really enjoy seeing those vintage cars they are nice. You can go there to get lots picture for your social network profile",
          "it is well worth a visit to the Volvo museum i have now been twice this year and last this time they have an XC90 full size made from LEGO it is very interesting too see ,i took the ferry from the Maritiman dock behind the Goteborg Opera house",
          "Visited this museum as part of a technical tour for a vehicle safety conference held in Gothenburg. Includes many interesting and well preserved or restored Volvo car and truck models from 1927 onwards. Also much information on the history of the Volvo company and displays of",
          "Very interesting museum going into the history of Volvo. It's not at all commercial (I was expecting it to be like a car showroom). You'll come a way with lots of interesting little facts, like the fact Volvo didn't patent the 3 point seat belt because they wanted as many people",
          "Having a motor trade background, I am always suspicious of 'showroom type' museums which consist of endless cars in prestigne condition bubble wrapped by rails and fences so that you can hardly appreciate them. That was my first impression when entering this place, but as I",
          "I loved this because I love cars. Don't bother if you don't...A massive headache to get there on public transport and a bit pricey, but you can't go to Gothenburg without visiting its most famous brand!",
          "I did enjoy the visit and the history of the Volvo company is very interesting but the people in our group who appreciated it most were the Volvo drivers, people who had worked on the cars or sold them. I liked the concept car designed by women - it was pretty except the gull",
          "The Volvo Museum in G\u00f6teborg is more than worth a visit, certainly when you are a \u201cVolvo Lover\u201d we personally had 2 Volvo Amazon from 1966 and a 1969, not to speak from the other we have driven. We visited the museum with our best friend, who is already 20 years the President of",
          "I grew up driving volvo's and really appreciated visiting the mothership and taking in their history. However, I'm not certain I would have made the trip 30+ mins outside the city if I wasn't so supportive of the brand.",
          "The museum is a bit far from the city, the bus drives through the cargo port, just stay on the bus. The museum bus stop could be marked better. Otherwise a great experience.",
          "I spend a day with my teenage son in this fantastic place. Here you can follow the history of Volvo from the start to today's fancy cars. Some trucks you can try out things in the cabin to similate real driving. When you are done with all the cars ands trucks you can have a",
          "The Museum shows Volvo's history from the beginning in 1927 (with the original desk of the two founders and their communication methods) until recent with also a hall that is totally designated to the Volvo Ocean Race. Apart from cars you'll find trucks and engines (and a Viggen",
          "Very nice set-up where you will discover the whole range of Volvo products, not only cars, along its history and learn about all the safety features that Volvo has invented.",
          "The museum is located in some industrial area and quite a distance from city central. The staff at the counter was busy doing her own things and only looked up when we wanted to pay for the ticket. We even had to ask where to go and where to start the tour. Unless you are",
          "When I and my parents visited it was a bit of a mess because they were renovating, but it was still quite good. I'm not a car enthusiast, but I still liked it. I imagine a car enthusiast or a Volvo enthusiast will really appreciate it.",
          "It's not a \"not to be missed\" location, but it is definitely worth visiting. The museum comprises also a Souvenir shop where most of the prices are decent.",
          "We were extremely disappointed in the museum. The women, who took our entrance fee, stated what we were to do, so fast that we did not understand. Then when I asked her to repeat it, I got an attitude. There were audio tapes available if you spoke Chinese or Swedish. I am",
          "Great museum - lots of exhibits from Volvo's history - including BTCC cars. It's a little further out of town - but worth the effort in getting there.",
          "A museum with an interesting mix of vintage and new Volvo cars as well as Volvo Group vehicles: trucks, buses and construction equipment, on two floors. There is a special wing about Volvo Ocean Race and the Volvo Golf tournaments.",
          "The museum is excellent! If you like all things Volvo of course. There are interactive displays, such as buses that can be sat in. The concept cars are very interesting.",
          "Basically you're paying Volvo to advertise at you, with poorly maintained exhibits (broken screens, non-functioning interactive set ups), and staff that feels it's necessary to use the handicapped-baby changing toilet rather than any of the 5 normal toilets, despite the nearly",
          "Although located on a ( maily Volvo) industrial ara, near the waterfront though, it was easy to find as the museum clearly indicated on road signs ( went by car). A nice fresh building with high ceiling. The exhibition takes you from early cars to modern cars, including even",
          "You have a complete show on what Volvo Cars have done over the years from the very start until selfdriven cars i the future. Well worth a call and for enjoy a souvernir in the shop.",
          "We were one lover of cars (male), one adult female, and two teens - on public transport it felt quite a hike to get out to this museum, and it was very disappointing overall. The cars were all in fine condition, but there was nothing interactive or really interesting about the",
          "visit is fine , easy to get no expensive but there are not so nice car or things . basically e parade of car except for engiene",
          "Here you can see almost all of Volvo's different models and even the ones that were never let into the market. Also they they let you do the jorney back in time in good way.",
          "Volvo is one of 3 automotive brends that I am fan of. Therefore I visited this place at the very first day of my stay in Gothenburg. Of course museum is not as big as Daimler or BMW in Germany, but still worth to visit. There are old cars, commercial vehicles, one room dedicated",
          "We all thought it was very interesting. ( family of 4 - 2 adults and 2 children aged 9 and 10) You could easily spend 1 and a half hours there. The interactive exhibits in the ocean race section were very good. Definitely try it out and it's worth noting that the factory is only",
          "It is nice place to see all model Volvo cars, trucks & Boats. You can spend more 1 to 2 hours here. If you are working in Volvo then Entrance is free, but you have to pay for your family. It is not much interesting but OK..",
          "As there's not so many attraction in Gothenburg, this museum is the best attraction I have seen there. The car exhibition itself is very interesting, it starts with old pre-WWII era Volvo cars, shows notable Volvos that have been produced over the years, and finishes with Volvo",
          "There is nothing to see except normal cars. it's not like a museum. it's like a auto show. Every single person in our group regretted that he went.",
          "so you have to get a tram and change to a bus which seems to be taking you to an industrial area, but at the ened of the line is the Volvo museum! Great place to visit - quirky and not just for car enthusiasts. I learnt a lot about the company, brand, its ethos etc and what",
          "Upon entering, I was impressed with the cleanliness and order of the museum. The care and attention to detail given to each exhibit is impressive. The gift shop is pricey, but if this is a once in a lifetime visit, it may be very well worth it. The blend of trucks, cars, boat",
          "Look at the old Volvo cars. They really had caractars. Thera are also some cars they never have been sold on the market.",
          "Lots of cars, but also boats, engines, trucks and even a couple of airplanes. A nicely done museum, worth the visit.",
          "We have had several Volvos and still drive Volvo today. This is the place to visit when you are visiting G\u00f6teborg and love Volvos.",
          "Interesting museum on one of the great Sweden Icon. Who doesn\u2019t know Volvo!? You can see the history of the brand and how it evolved to become a renowned worldwide not only in car industries but in a variety of other domain like trucks and heavy machinery. The great Volvo",
          "Volvos museum with cars and trucs is a given family tour. Facilities are good for wheelchair and strollers and there is a playing are as well.",
          "If you like cars, this is the place for you in Gothenburg, Volvo's home town. Amazing historic pieces at this museum, great to understand why Volvo is what is today and how they are able to keep alive their heritage and values so alive. Don't miss it!",
          "+ All Volvo models since 1923, they also have some busses and trucks and experimental (concept) vehicles. + Not so expensive entrance. + Small shop with clothes and suveniers. + Small coffee shop. + Free parking. + Open all days in week.",
          "We have visited many car factory museums around the world. Somehow Volvo has missed a trick here - one does not leave feeling like one simply 'has to buy a Volvo'! When we visited the Mercedes factory museum we simply 'really really wanted to get a Merc'.... same with VW, Audi",
          "It should not take more than 1 h to see the whole exhibition, unless you want to read every panel. I liked the first part most, with some pieces of history, the Lego bricks Volvo car, which by the way it's quite newly exhibited and of course the war planes and engines.",

          "Despite the person at reception telling me that I would need to stay about 1 hour, I stayed about 2.5. Enough to see here. I did not know Volvo did so much. I found the concept cars the most interesting. There are direct buses back to central Gothenburg after 330pm.",
          "Interesting museum both for adults and children lots of cars and trucks from the old days until today. The kids enjoyed \"driving\" a full scale bus and also playing around the the Ocean Race part.",
          "The Museum situated a bit far from the city centre but it can be reached by bus easily (bus 128 for example). You can learn about the history of the famous brand and sit in trucks and buy nice souvenirs. It's worth visiting!",
          "A historical Volvo show room, walk through time as you will. Found the model my friends drove 25 yrs ago. Excellent if you like cars. The museum shop did not have extensive offerings for purchase was the only disappointment.",
          "From the original desk the two founders used to the most modern of concept cars, and everything in between, it's all here. The display is on two levels. If you like cars, engineering, technology, trucks, or just Volvo, you must go here. Like the BMW Museum or Mercedes, it's",
          "I accompanied my volvo loving partner to this museum assuming I would need my itouch to keep me occupied, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt needed. Getting to this museum seemed quite a challenge for some unknown reason, even the volvo loving swedes are at a loss to its",

          "We just picked up our new Volvo from the factory nearby as part of their Overseas Delivery program. Naturally we had to visit the museum! First of all, it is quite a distance from the city so arrival by car is advised. I'm sure you can get there on the excellent public transit",

          "If you have an interest in cars, this museum is worth the effort to visit. It covers the almost 90 years of company activities through a very interesting and often eclectic display of vehicles ranging from cars to truck, buses and tractors. They even have jet engines, heavy",

          "Once you are in Gothenborg you should go and visit. Very nice and interesting overview of the brand. I went there by myself and have to say I enjoyed very much even I\u00b4m woman. I found out a lot of information where you can find some Volvo engines or components I didn\u00b4t know",
          "If you are in Gothenburg, you should definitely visit Volvo Museum. Here you could walk through the history of Volvo and experience some landmark inventions. The whole museum tour takes atleast 1 hour but there is no limit on how much time you can spend, so just get easy and",

          "If your on a cruise (and your lucky) you should dock a few yards from the museum main entrance. Its 60 Swedish Kroner per person and there is a lot to see, Volvo cars from the start of production, a familiarisation film available in most languages, then through a bit of a warren",
          "We have been to several car museums, but this museum is unique because it is for the Volvo brand only. It is located in the Arendal area about 10 km west of Gothenburg city centre near some of the cruise docks. If you are on a cruise, make sure you save some time for this",
          "You'll see the history of the development of the Volvo - from its early start as a bus to today's concept cars and everything in between. The cars are nicely displayed and curated, with helpful information. You'll want to take a car home with you when you leave!",

          "Our visit to the Volvo Museum was included in the Overseas Delivery of our new automobile. While there was a small admission fee for the general public, we were given a voucher for free admission as part of our OSD package. The history of Volvo was fascinating, and decades of",

          "We maybe had to much expection for this museum but it was nothing at all to see. Didnt like the crew who was working there eaither. Dont go if you have other options",
          "I guess I didn't really have any expectations of this museum, but it interested my boyfriend so I was dragged along. I think I enjoyed it as much as he did. It is so well set out and has a great assortment of not only cars, but also boats, trucks and machines that it keeps you",
          "Despite it was really hard to find I loved this museum. Of course it\u00b4s all about Volvo, and shows the development of Volvo until today. Really interesting and beautiful cars.",
          "The Volvo museum is very interesting, at least for us Swedes. It tells all the history of Volvo and you can look at many cars and trucks but not so many buses... The only minus is the location and it could be really tricky getting there if you dont speak swedish.",
          "Placed in an somehow odd place in the far part of the harbor this is an excellent, though quite traditional museum telling the story of Volvo - the cars, the trucks, the busses, the aero engine-department, the Penta marine-department, the construction equipment and Volvo Ocean",

          "My wife and I had the opportunity to visit the Volvo manufacturing plant as well as the museum when we picked up our new car at factory last year . The tour of the plant was amazing. The museum was equally educational. We would highly recommend a visit to both places while",

          "I like cars; I like Volvo. My ship recently docked about 100m away from the entrance to this unassuming little museum, so we thought that we would take a spin around and learn about this Swedish icon. Due to its remote location - if you aren't mad about Volvo OR going to there",
          "Well hidden in the Arendal area far out from the city center is this hidden little gem. However, if you are interested in cars and Volvos specifically (and have a car to get there...) this is a well managed museum. All of the Volvo history in one place together with a many of",
          "Our cruise ship docked a couple of hours early and the museum was right across the street. We hadn't planned to visit, but had the time and it was right there. It was a pleasant surprise. There were cars and trucks from the past as well as concept cars for the future. All",
          "The exhibits are well done, from early Volvos to concept cars and trucks. Our 82 DL and 97 T5 were there. We hope to return after buying a replacement for our 2013 S60 that is now crossing the Atlantic - maybe in 2030.",
          "A very well put together museum with all sorts of interesting vehicles including Heavy Trucks, Cars, Earthmoving equipment & Aircraft. Has some areas where people can interact which is fun. A credit to the Volvo group & the city of Gothenberg, the home of Volvo.",
          "While well laid out and informative, a museum of cars just isn't my thing. We stopped. By as it was free and we had an hour or so to kill before lunch. Not sure I'd have done so otherwise.",
          "You need a car to visit the car museum, but definitely worth a visit and you can easy spend a couple of hours.",
          "We are interested in classic cars and own a Volvo, so had to visit. There is a good selection of cars as well as trucks and buses. Only 60 SEK entrance",
          "Lots of vehicles to see from trucks to cars to prototypes and some very interesting interactive displays",
          "Excellent museum - well laid out and very interesting. Very convenient for cruise passengers as directly by the ship. Would recommend a visit if you have time.",
          "Volvoes complete history including the cars of course, as well as prototypes and more. A little off-track out at Arendal, but once you find it you will have a nice time. I wish I could buy the old cars in the merchandize shop.",
          "We were picking up a new Volvo and enjoyed the Volvo experience a great deal. Visit the old part of town.",
          "Loved the service, loved the new car! Lunch was fine, traditional Swedish meatballs and potatoes. The factory tour was not quite as interesting as I thought it might be, but it was okay.",

          "The Volvo museum is next the where the cruise ships dock, so a great little excursion you can straight off the boat if travelling that way. It approx \u00a36 to get in so doesn't break the bank. The collection includes all the cars they've made, buses, trucks and even a section on",
          "If you have been to any of the German car museums (I have been to Audi, M-Benz, BMW and Porsche), this is NOT where close. If you are a Volvo fan OR if you have extra time, I'd see it... otherwise, I think there are better options.",
          "this was definitely the place that gave me the 'wow' effect. i have always been fascinated to automobiles and so visited this place, and this museum didn't disappoint me at all. the manner in which the cars are displayed and explanation boards are put up, visitors really feel",
          "Having bought my first Volvo, I was interested in learning about how the company was formed and what had led to their obsession with safety and value! There are cars from all different eras as well as trucks and commercial vehicles. Interesting to learn of where Volvo wants to",
          "As a newly proud owner of a Volvo XC 90 I couldnt leave without seeing these museum and not only because Volvo paid for our admission, but It was a pleasant surprise to see all the latest and greatest of Volvo advances from past history of an antique desk where the two founders",
          "well it was a fascinating experience to see all those robots at work !",
          "There are a lot of cars in this nice clean museum but there are also airplanes, trucks, and other things to amuse most people. Getting there is a bit tricky while there is construction on the 155 highway after the bridge. Right lane is carpool/bus lane so stay in the left",
          "The Volvo museum is not huge but it is full of great cars, trucks and buses and you get the full Volvo history from 1927 to the present. Concept cars are included as well and last time I was there, there was a great exhibition about the Volvo Ocean Race. It is a bit out of the",

          "If you like that particular brand, or are interested on how automotive industry developed outside the big historical centres, don't miss. Small, not hi tech, but a wonderfull collection of Volvos from all times. I didn't have a clue on that company development during xX century.",

          "I've never owned a Volvo, but I enjoyed learning about the history of the company and seeing the range of its products. I now aspire to order a Volvo in the US and pick it up at the factory in G\u00f6teborg.",
          "The Volvo museum is a short bus ride from central station and situated in the industrial part of town, right on the water of a sea port. Entrance is free with the Gothenburg city card. It is a beautifully laid out museum with the cars situated in areas that look like city",

          "Well hidden on the Northern side of Gothenburg, in the western harbor area of Hisingen, this extremely interesting and well-presented museum is well worth a visit. Not only enthusiasts, but also kids and \"normal\" persons will enjoy this. It is very much a time-machine, from the",

          "This is a great museum for families with children that enjoy cars and technical things. My 12 yr old son really enjoyed it, so did we. It is well worth its modest entrance fee 100 Skr (for a family ticket). Some great vintage and more modern cars (and lorries) on display. We",
          "For a car-loving family like mine, we had a time of our life looking at and experiencing Volvo cars from 1927 to date ..the new volvo concept car of the future.. The display is dramatic using videos at strategic places. The other offerings of Volvo such as buses, trucks also",

          "Intresting and well arranged museum that tells you the story of Volvo. Down side is that it's quite hard to find/get there, unless you're taking a cab, but riding a tram/bus combination is far more cheaper. Entry fee 20 sek (kids6-12 v), 50 sek (adult) and 100 sek (family).",

          "Volvo is a brand that most people around the world associate with boxy wagons or big semi-trucks. It's cool to see a musuem, though, that covers the full range of the company. From the first desk where the founder of Volvo would sit with co-founders and clients their first"

Skansen Kronan was introduced in 1698 and  was fitted with 23 guns. The roof was not completed until 1700. Skansen has 4-5 metre thick walls made of granite, gneiss and diabase. Skansen Kronan was never attacked and the cannons on the inside have never been used.The fortress and the twin counterpart, Skansen Lejonet, were built as part of the defenses against possible Danish attack on Gothenburg from the south, and thus had a similar purpose as the \u00c4lvsborg fortress.\nThe fortress \u2014 originally built outside the city walls \u2014 is today situated in the city centre of Gothenburg on a hill in the city district of Haga. It was used as a military museum until 2004. Today Skansen Kronan is a private facility for conferences and private parties.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nMattsson, Britt-Marie (1992) Parkernas G\u00f6teborg (G\u00f6teborg: AB L\u00e5ngedrag, Tryckeri AB Fram\u00e5t)  ISBN 91-630-1016-X\nSch\u00e5nberg, Sven; Stig Allan Agroth (1989) Vid Skansbergets fot : Hagastudier i bild och ord (G\u00f6teborg)  ISBN 91-85786-21-7\nRhedin,  Per (1996) Med hammare, sax och t\u00e5ng: En liten historik om pl\u00e5tslageriet i G\u00f6teborg,   (utgiven av G\u00f6teborgs Bleck- & Pl\u00e5tslagarem\u00e4staref\u00f6rening)   ISBN 91-630-4459-5\n\n\n== External links ==\nSkansen Kronan website\nG\u00f6teborgs skansar",

Used to be 1600\u2019s defences, they were all but taken down to allow the city to grow but this and it\u2019s sister \u2018the lion\u2019 were left & renovated in the 1930\u2019s.

          "The view over the city and the river is very nice, with an almost 360 degrees panorama. However the access to the inside of the tower is restricted as this is a restaurant / place for special events. So it's nice to go there for the view, but not for the building itself.",
          "We asked in the tourist centre where to go and they pointed us to this place and told us it was a great view point. What they didn't tell us was that it was quite the trek to get to (it was a super hot & sweaty day so that didn't help and maybe if the weather was a bit cooler it",

          "Its a long climb/walk to the top only to find nothing there, a waste of time for sure / view was nice...",
          "The fortress on Risasberget Hill has been watching over the city since 1689 but has never been in any battles. The stones in the building are suppose to have come from the old fortress of Elfsborg and the roof was added in 1700. It has four floors and the walls are 4-5 metres",
          "Fantastic view! Great place to relax and enjoy the overwhelming panorama view across the sea and the many islands. Make sure you are ready to walk an uneven path uphill easily.",

          "right in the city center and squeezed in between the old quarters of Haga (take a walk through) and the Linn\u00e9staden, old houses and wide street, bouth areas perfect for lunch, coffee or dinner later on, you can find this little hill with the fort on top. a fort build way back in",

          "Skansen Kronan successfully guarded Gothenburg harbor from invasion for hundreds of years. It deserves a better fate than being a catering hall and concert spot. Climbing this long stair case is not easy for an old man and especially disappointing to find this unique fortress",

          "Nice views and a historic building. Also, getting to the top of the many stairs provided us with some exercise.",
          "I suppose you could make the climb if you are in the area. Otherwise don't. There are so many other, much more interesting spots to visit that comes with this type of view.",
          "Went up for the view on a sunny day. Based on the descriptions and reviews, I was a bit afraid of the climb but it was not bad at all. Yet, it is high enough to look down the whole city. I went there after strolling Haga (very close) then walked to the Fish Church - all done in",
          "We climbed to this place in December and fortunately we had good weather. We were a bit tired once we arrived to the top but the view from here is spectacular. It is a free programme, you can reach it easily from Haga. There is also a restaurant here by pre-booking.",
          "It's an old fortress/watch tower built basically to defend the city, but probably never used in a battle. It is located up on the hill overlooking the whole city which gave a very nice panoramic view.",
          "Although closed when we visited, this hill top fortress has a very good view of the city. There are a few stairs to climb, but a worthwhile trek for the view. The outside viewing deck is quite small so it's worth waiting to be up there alone.",
          "Lot of stairs to climb before you can reach the top, but the views over the city are worth it. Good place to take pictures. I recommend to buy a Hagabulle (gigantic cinnamon bun) from Haga to go and eat it when you reach the top while enjoying the views.",
          "I hiked up Skansen Kronan with my 53-year old mother who is in ok shape and she grew tired and had to stop at a few of the platforms for a minute or two. I would not suggest this for a crew of over 60 years old. The view from the top is spectacular.",
          "I've lived in Gothenburg 6 months and I can't believe I've only just been up to the top of Skansen Kronan. This is definitely worth doing as its free, very quick and easy to get to from Haga or Jantorget. Get the 6 tram from central and head up the steps! It's free and there are",

          "This little hill has a panoramic view over the city of Gothenburg. But despite its charms, Gothenburg is not a particularly pretty city from a distance. Don't get me wrong, I like Gothenburg and it is really nice up-close, but the view from here is uninspiring. If you want to",
          "It is a point you can reach there easily in city center and have a look and view to city from above.i recommend it to you",

          "Beautiful views of the city and worth the trip. It can get very windy up top so be sure to dress warm. It looked like there was a wedding happening in the castle itself so I didn't stay too long inside, just enough to warm up for the trip down. There are a lot of stairs up, but",

          "This an old Gothenburg fortress is situated very central - close to J\u00e4rntorget. If you want to go up to the fortress take good shoes and be ready for the steepy hill.",
          "We spotted this 'castle' as it was highlighted on the tourists map we were given by our hotel, but really was very unimpressed when we looked around. Yes its a lovely refreshing walk up the mound to get to the building but the view from the top is nothing special. The building",
          "My first night I saw this hill. I went up for a visit and got a great view on Goteborg. many people come here to enjoy the view at sunset. The building was closed already but I found it interesting and loved the view.",
          "The building as itself is just and old building with not too much to show. Going up the hill for almost 200 steps will put a strain in some of the people but the views of Goteborg are breath taking.",
          "I go up almost everytday suring spring and summer, after 197 steps you have a unique city view from Gothenburg and you can comeback from Linnegatan to the city.",
          "Went up after having a meal at Haga (good way to burn off the extra calories) and the panoramic view of the city from this high hill was breathtaking. There was explanation regarding the fortress with the crown on the top but seating at the edge/ on the cannon/ stairs near the",
          "Not very spectacular, if you don't manage to get inside. Not sure when it is actually open. But the view is good and you can easily spend 30-60 minutes just sitting there and look around",
          "Skansen Kronan located on the high hill, there are several path how to climb there, but all of the routes are quite steep. Once you reach the top you will see the building itself with a nice city panorama. You can relax for a while, sit on the bench and enjoy the city view.",
          "Lots of steps to the top, where you get a decent view over an uninspiring city view. Nothing is really tall enough to stick out. Far in the distance is the Ullevi stadium. Quick walk from Haga",
          "Worth the steep climb up slopes or steps to see the cityscape. Nothing much up there just the fortress and some cannons.",
          "Good luck going up the stairs but the view is quite nice especially on a sunny day. Makes a nice stop by if you're in the Haga area.",
          "Kronan open-air museum is a fortress which once served as a prison ... nice view of the entire Goteborg.",
          "A stonesthrow from Linn\u00e9gatan this landmark is up on a high hill with incredible views of Gothenburg. On Sundays the tower can be booked for functions such as weddings but mostly its a great place to see this beautiful city from a birds-eye perspective. It's very dog friendly",
          "Skansen Kronan is, for sure, one of the thing that everybody should visit in Gothenburg. After a nice walk and/or a coffee in Haga, it is imposible to avoid those stairs that take you to an incredible view of the city. Do not miss the oportunity. It is magical in every",
          "A great viewing point worth the short but very steep hike up the hill on the streets behind Haga. You can see all over the city and get a feel for the lay of the land.",
          "Wonderful views even on the drizzly day I visited. It is a fair climb to the top, but plenty of stopping places. There is some history to it and it would be interesting if there was more information when you got to the top, besides the one board, as it seems a fairly important",
          "One of Gothenburgs more interesting monuments. It was a fair climb to get there but we were rewarded with excellent views over the city. Worth the effort.",
          "We got a really nice view over the city, even on a fairly misty day. Lots of steps if you go up that way or you can pick a slightly gentler slope up and down instead. Interesting board with a little bit of information about the building but the main attraction is definitely",
          "From this place you can have a nice view of the city of Gothenburg. It is definetly a good place for pictures.",
          "We visited Skansen Kronan in winter.. its a beautiful place. We are planning to visit it again this summer.",
          "Lovely views and good to get your bearings. Check the opening times if you want to go inside. Sunday brunch and lunch sounds like a great way to combine a climb up the tower with traditional food",
          "I didn't know this place existed until I spotted it down a side street in Haga. The long flight of stairs at the base were what lured me in. There's over 150 steps to the top and I thought it would be a good idea to jog up them. Totally knackered at the top. The building has",
          "Skansen Krona is one of those places of interest that you can either have (if you are interested in the history of Gothenburg and have an hr or so to spare) or not have (it's a step climb and there is nothing really to see apart from the view that isn't fantastic).",
          "Fantastic views over G\u00f6tenborg from the hill of Skansen Kronan. On the way down, check out the cafe selling the oversize cinnamon buns! Great day out.",
          "definitely worth all the stairs! even on a foggy miserable day the views from the top are gorgeous. there is a 360 degree view of gothenburg, a must see for all those staying in the area!",
          "The stroll through rhe old residential area of Haga with eclectic shops, great caf'es and eateries makes the trip out worthwhile. Scaling the steps that are old and not maintained through fall and winter can make this treacherous! You might well want to opt for the winding",
          "Here you will see and learn about the history of the Gothenborg area as well as the history of the town itself. The building is well preserved and offers a stunning view of Gothenborg itself, a must for anybody interested in history, or military history.",
          "I find this well worth a visit if you'd like to see a nice overview of the city, and it's free of charge. Took a stroll up this hill - starting at Skanstorget (Haga) and crossed over to end up at Lilla Ris\u00e5sgatan (Linnestaden) and it was a pretty steep uphill walk to begin",
          "You get a great view over Gothenburg from here and it's free. Beware: there are a lot of steps up and it's easy to get out of breath if you're not that fit but once you're up there it's really worth it. It's in the Haga area, so you can always reward yourself with coffee and",
          "There are a couple of ways to get up the hill, I ended up taking the easy way up just because that was the direction I was coming from, although taking the stairs would have also been nice. It was a nice relaxing winding path up to the top for me with the fortress becoming more",
          "You must go up a little, in the open air , tranquility , some good views , in a nice part of the city",
          "A long way up made from more than 200 steps but your reward is there : the stunning skyline of Gothenburgh, with all the important architectural pieces this city has to offer. A must if you are in the city and have some time off.",
          "You MUST be fit to visit Skansen Kronan: over 200 steps up, walking is your only option to get to the top! But once you are ther, my gosh the view!! Second to none!",
          "A little disappointing after a trek across the city. It would have been nice if the fort was a museum or something of interest you could go into. Apparently it is now just used for parties? Veiw is pretty though.",
          "Skansen Kronan offers a brilliant view over Gothenburg and it's definitely worth the walk up hill - beware the steps, they're really steep! - from Haga. The view is excellent.",
          "I\u00b4m sure it\u00b4s one of the best views over the city, but be prepared for more than a 100 steps... You can, however, choose the hiking on the other side of the hill!",
          "Easy to locate, while walking through Haga you will notice streets leading off the main strip to small hill with tower on top. Steep but reasonably short walk to the top for great views of city. No signs indicating the tower is open for sightseeing. Area is popular with locals",
          "after too much shopping we felt like having to move a bit. So we took the steep stairs almost running. However the view was not as astonishing as expected, because of thriving trees. A bit too many smoking chimneys and grey roofs, if you don't mind.",
          "Skansen Kronan is just south of Haga, and it's worth the 45 minutes or so it takes to walk up the ramp/steps, snap some pics, and walk down. The inside of the fortress seems to open only for special events, but you can still walk all the way around the fortress itself and",
          "The views from the top are incredible and it is definitely worth a visit. We arrived around sunset and had a beautiful panaramic view of the city. The area was quite busy with groups of people enjoying picnics and just taking in the view. I'm not a big fitness person but I",
          "Skansen Kronan is situated on top of a hill between Linn\u00e9gatan and Haga a walk to the top provides some fantastic views over the city. If you don't like the idea of walking up there's a road up and a small area to park cars.",
          "This should be on your top 5 places to see in Gothenburg. Beautiful panoramic view over the city as well as a delightful resting place.",
          "Take a deep breath and walk the 192 steps up to the top, to find an amazing view of G\u00f8teborg! See the bastion that protected the harbor, without ever firing a single cannonball",
          "I visited Skansen Kronan a week ago, during latests days of the Volvo Ocean Race, with some friends and I need to tell that it was a lovely experience. You could see all Gothenburg from heights and you'll charmed, for sure. Then, you could walk round The Haga and your visit will",
          "Cute little kitty at bottom of stairs ok hike up good for pictures nothing to do up top but take quick picture some people took time to lay in the sun",
          "This hill gives you a spectatcular view of the entire city of Gothenburg. The inital flight of steps looks a bit daunting, but take you time and you'll find the top simply breathtaking.",
          "Great views of Gothenburg from the top. The building itself is a nice historic piece of Gothenburg, a former fortress and defense tower equipped with towers and a great lookout.",
          "Nearly lost my way following Google map and even tried to climb up the 60 degree slope==actually it's easy to find a route up, there are signposts around. Thankfully arrived before sunset :p. Nice view of Haga city, buildings with red roofs are quite cute :p. Be careful and do",
          "Do you have tired children with you ? Count the steps up to the Skans... :) It\u00b4s a beautiful view over hole Gotheburg and out to the sea, harbour. Nice Skans bulidning. You can walk up from Haga side or Linne side. The steps are from Haga and the backside is from Linne (less",
          "The view from this place is really nice, however, the staircase leading to it is really something. It is also possible to go by car.",
          "Built in the 1700's, the fortress was built to protect the city from being attacked by the Danes in the South. After climbing the steep hill up to the top, it provides you with a wonderful view of the city.",
          "Great place for a nice view of the city, especially during the sunset. Good for picnics as well. There are some cannons, some fortifications and the tower. You get a panoramic view of the city and you get to know a bit of its history. There are 3 ways to get to the top of the",
          "This is a great attraction. You get stunning 360 views of the city, and you can learn a little bit about the history of the city. Well worth the walk up the hill.",
          "This was a nice view and a good combination with a visit to haga as the significant stairs will help you work off the pastries you will most probably have eaten at one of the many caf\u00e9s in haga.",
          "The stairs are a killer but a great workout for the bum ;) but once you have reached the top there are plenty of pictures to be taken of the building and also the whole of central Gothenburg. there is a restaurant located in the building but we did not eat there. Choose a clear",
          "It is a beautiful place with a great view of the city , close to the great life of Haga and the excellent restaurants of the area. If you go prepare you could have a great picnic at the top.",
          "If you can stand walking up stairs this is a hill oasis in the center of the city. Located close to Haga you'll find yourself a quiet place of peace with an astonishing view of the city.",
          "It's a fortification located close to Haga district, on the top of a little hill. From there is possible to see some views over the city. But is not a must see.",
          "On all three of my visits to Gothenburg, I have never been inside of the old fortress (hence just 4 stars for now), but the walk up to the hilltop is well worth it for the amazing views over the city. Plus, it's a great way to work off those delicious giant cinnamon buns from",
          "Beautiful historical building, serving a buffet lunch. Lots and lots of difficult steps. Not a place for older people to climb. Parking difficult. Serve yourself. No service, no attention. But worth a look. At least one time.",
          "Take the stairs up or walk by the road (on the \"backside\" of Skansen Kronan). And you will find a place with great view over Gothenburg. But the best part is that you can stay here for a rest. Bring a blanket with you and just lay down and rest for a while. You can bring food",
          "Beautiful view without a need for a long hike. Great place to start exploring Gothenburg. It was a little windy when I was there, but gorgeous in the sunshine.",
          "The view from Skansen Kronan is really good and it's a great spot for taking photos. A lot of people have picnics up there and it looks very nice!",
          "Its old and interesting and aqccessible and worth the walk up to the top and around the place to get a feel for it's age and history",
          "It's a great view from up here and you can also visit the tower itself for 40sek you will also find an cafe at the top of the hill. Please bear in mind that it's a challenge to climb up, specially if you have small kids or some sort of disease.",
          "A great view awaits you from this old watch tower, but the climb up there can take your breath away.",
          "On a hill, an old fortress building overlooks the surrounding. It is a bit of an effort to claim up the stairs, but once there the view is very pretty, even though it is only possible to see it outside the tower, as it is closed to the public."

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies.

Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad.

The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet.

Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes.

V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "One of the stops we did while in Gothenburg, the museum definitely had a lot of nice pieces. It was particularly nice since they had sections dedicated to Scandinavian art, which I feel tends to get underrepresented a lot. If you are a fan of art, I highly recommend stopping",

          "It is not a very big collection, but it has a number of famous works and artists. The collection has rooms dedicated to different epoques / themes. That is good, because it makes it easier for you to male priorities of your time. The rooms themselves are also quite beautiful and",

          "The museum's permanent collection features an eclectic mix of work that spans over four centuries and many countries. Works by several famous and well-known artists are there, including Reubens, Rembrandt, Picasso and Matisse, but I found the work of less-known artists even more",
          "Set in a historical building. The artwork is amazing. As you enter each room, dont forget to look up, the detail in some of the rooms will amaze you. I loved the collection of Impressionism. If you want to use a locker, take coins",

          "several of the collections are modern and make quite an impression, by the way they are put out in the museum, the classic are just great, with lots of nordic artists work, quite impressive. Museum has very good staff that can talk you through the exhibitions, if you want to see",

          "I think the museum is worth a visit just for the architecture. The building was opened in 1925 and it is a great example of the architecture of that time. The museum's permanent art collection is quite good - surprisingly many big names: Picasso, Rodin, Degas, Monet ect and a",

          "Their collection of nordic artists from the turn of the century is unique. Just this part is well worth a visit! They also have their fair share of \"name dropping\" artists like; Picasso, Rubens etc. When we come to the modern art selection, there is two exhibits I would dispute",

          "This art museum has some good examples of the famous artists you've heard of, but the real gem is discovering the Swedish and Nordic artists that you didn't. There is also the Hassleblad Center for photography that seems to have a rotating exhibition from intriguing photography",
          "The entrance fee is cheap, and also grants free entrance to a lot of other museums in town. Considering that in combination with the very central location it would be unwise not to visit this sight unless you don't like art.",

          "I think one should go to the museum of fine art simply because it hosts one of the best paintings ever: the sick girl by Edward Munch. On top of that you'll find Picasso's Braque's and discover really good unknown Swedish artists.",
          "They have a great collection on the 6th floor, so catch the lift straight up. Then walk down to see the rest. The highlight is definitely the 6th floor. \u00a34 entry gets you into 4 other museums in Gothenburg too. Worth a visit.",
          "The right stop for the art lover, as it shows you some beautiful art pieces from old to new. It is displayed on several floors, which was a bit like a maze for me. It was not far from my conference venue and the tram service is just a short walk away.",

          "A pretty impressive collection for what is Sweden's 2nd(?) city. Most notable were the Monets, a Van Gogh and a lot of Picasso, plus my favourite Sisley. The museum also commands a great view down the main thoroughfare of the city and has a decent little cocktail bar to one side",

          "Was a nice museum for a city this size. Had some good pieces in it. Would recommend as admission price was not expensive. We felt is was worth the money. Some of the modern art was lost on me and layout was strange modern room next to old masters room. Again worth the admission",
          "This museum has some excellent artwork. I was not familiar with a lot of the artists but that doesn't mean the work was not of the highest quality. It also has a number of paintings by Picasso and Bonnard. Take the lift to the top (6th) floor and then work your way down.",

          "There are no major works of art here but otherwise a pleasing mixture of old and new. Big enough to be worth a visit but not so large that you lose the will to live. Special mention for the bookshop which is good for 10-15 minutes browsing.",

          "well located , close to the avenyn. excellent exibitions and works of art. beautiful building. had fun",
          "We spent a few hours in this gallery on our last day in Sweden, and were very impressed. The collection begins with a great sculpture gallery, and then after taking a lift to the 6th floor, you can freely meander through separate rooms containing a specific period of Swedish,",
          "Lovely building with a decent art collection worth an hour of you time. As well as the core exhibitions, there are visiting exhibitions. Make sure you ask for the ticket that gets you into a number of other museums also (for no extra cost), not just the visiting exhibitions.",
          "The weather was cold and this seemed a great place to visit during our weekend in Gothenburg. The lady who served us at the museum was very friendly and helpul explaining that the ticket we had purchased would allow us entrance into another handful of mueums in the city so",
          "As lovers of art we saved our visit for a day forecast to snow. The lady on reception was very helpful explaining the prices and the best way to explore the galleries. We made use of the smart, clean lockers to hang out coats and leave our bags (refundable 5kr coin). The museum",
          "This art museum does not have a huge collection, however it does merit a visit. A good small collection of Picasso paintings, and an interesting collection of 20th century Scandinavian artists on the top floor is particularly interesting. Most of all is is fascinating to see",
          "Museum or Art is housed in a impressive building from 1925.Art from the 1400's until today.The museum has a Scandinavian profile which is featured in the educational order.Here you will find famous international artists like Picasso, Rembrant to mention a few. In the museum shop",
          "The Museum of Fine Art was a good find on what was a cold and snowy day in Gothenburg. The Museum is well located at the end of a major shopping avenue (I walked there from the Central Station area). The collection covers many eras and has a very good collection of Swedish",
          "Hasselblad center has interesting exibitions of photography. The art collections on six floors, from modern to older are well varied , and the temporary exibitions are usually interesting .",
          "Just excellent........filled with Scandinavian treasures. A delight to experience. An experience for all art lovers not to be missed. Just delightful!",
          "We enjoyed the fine art museum, 6 floors worth of art ranging from modern to more classic pieces. If you enjoy varied art then you should visit while in Gothenburg. Great for a rainy day.",
          "This museum was such a pleasant surprise! It is very well-structured which always improves the overall experience. They have mostly art from the 17th century onward, so most visitors would find the art displayed fairly accessible (this is meant in a positive way). The collection",
          "I took a walk through Gothenburg and discovered the museum of art. At the end my visit took 2 hours longer than I planned to spend in the city, because I really enjoyed exploring all the artworks and the temporary exhibition in this nice building. As a student the entry was",
          "The museum is in a very impressive building and was very well laid out with special exhibitions on as well. We enjoyed the impressionist and paintings by the Scandinavian artists",
          "It has different schedule of opening hours and closed on Monday, so check before you are planning. You can buy a ticket worth only 40 SEK that allows you to visit this museum and 4 others for whole year. Now if this doesnt make you visit this museum, then its large collection of",
          "Imposing building but interior is not so impressive however, lots of great works on show and great photos in the hassleblad centre - well worth a look.",
          "An interesting mix of art works on display both ancient and modern.We did not pay the extra for the temporary shows but there was enough to see and do. Friendly helpful staff",
          "i have been that place by recommendation of my local friend. i have visited many museums but that place is so unique. if you like museums must visit that place.",
          "Good art, good guides. Diversity of painters. Many kind of guest exhibitions during the year so you can go often.",
          "I love museums and I used to visit a lot of them around Europe and I have to say that I am surprised about the vastness of paintings in this museum. In Konstmuseum you can admire Gauguin, Van Gogh, Kandinsky and Rembrandt. The museum has 4 floors, full of amazing paintings and",
          "We got there late and missed a living art workshop that you can take part in which was a shame. The Hasselblad photography exhibit is wonderful and though provoking indeed. The museum misses out on a 5 star review as the lady at reception was more interested in Facebook on her",
          "The museum often holds special exhibitions like Monet, Helene Scherfbeck and Frida Kahlo, go to their website for info on the present exhibition. The special exhibitions often cost money but the standard exhibitions ticket only costs 40 SEK, lasts a year and is valid for the",

          "An excellent place to visit. Superbly maintained very easy to navigate. Hunderds of paintings depicting various times.",
          "Interesting Swedish art as well as more famous artists as well, very relaxed atmosphere, extremely reasonable museum prices.",
          "It's always good to see a Rembrandt and a Monet but this museum combines these stellar names with interesting Scandinavian art. Good value for 40SEK which includes entrance to other museums in the city.",
          "For the size of the city, this is a good size museum with a variety of art. Don't expect it to be like an art museum in Paris because it's not (I've been and no, it's not). I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. The admission price is also cheap and allows you",
          "Before entering the museum, take a good look at the statue outside... And the gate infront of the main entrence. Beautiful. Lots of nordic art and sometime an estra exibition, In october it was Emil Nolde, A Danish/german Painter. Lots of interesting paintings",
          "Nordic mood paintings, battleships from the 17th century combined with caricatures and modern art. For some reason half the museum smelled fried fish. That spoiled the experience a little bit.",
          "A casual art museum with exciting rooms and spaces.The collectiont is from the conventional and expected to odd works. My favourite is Odd Nerdrums \"The murder of Andreas Baader\".",
          "Surprised by the collections and quality of Nordic artists. Broad and nice permanent collection. Also a space for changing exhibitions. Nice restaurant for lunch.",
          "Great museum. I had the luck to visit it in September, I think off season. There were few visitors and I had time to wonder around the various spaces and halls. It is filled with masterpieces. The staff is kind and not intrusive, you almost do not realize there are people around",
          "Worth a visit-great collection of Scandinavian artists and contemporary art, easy to get around and quiet!",
          "Fine collection of both old masters and new Scandinavia art, and an excellent bookstore. Worth a half-day visit.",
          "The collection is varied. Some amazing pieces of contemporary art mixed with French rococo, Picasso, French Impressionists, etc. Also a great spread of Scandinavian artists.",
          "Lovely 19th century collection of Swedish painting, great space and very friendly staff. The modern art selection is a little less impressive, but maybe that says more about my preference than the collection",
          "We visited this fabulous looking museum on a short trip to Gothenburg. It is situated right at the top of Kungsportsavenyn and overlooked by the magnificent Poseidon statue. Hosting a wonderful collection, this museum is a must when visiting. It has Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso,",
          "On our way back to the hotel, my boyfriend and I stopped in for a visit. The free entrance for us since we are under 25 years of age certainly brightened our day. There's a pretty diverse collection of art, the majority of which was Nordic but the most we spent was an hour in",
          "The permanent art collection spans paintings from the 17C to the late 20C so there is variety and contrast aplenty, from Van Dyck through Kandinsky to Munch and Post-Modernism. The sculpture is equally diverse, including a Henry Moore and some baffling conceptual pieces.",
          "Located in the most pronounced building of Gothenburg is a quite surprisingly rich collection of paintings. Many of the great Scandinavian artworks, but some well known continental ones too. My favorite painting is of the dead King Karl XII by Gustaf Cederstr\u00f6m which is",
          "A chance to be \"up close and personal\" with the art. Lovely collection with Scandinavian artists not known well in other countries.",
          "In a somehow \"aged\" environment, one gets an excellent overview of visual arts from classics to modern, with an accent on Scandinavian work. We had the chance during our visit to se the exhibition of Lena Svedberg's \"Mr. Aldman\" (until November 1, 2015). Don't miss the",
          "Great comprehensive collection of art; Hasselblad Foundation displays its shows here as well. DELICIOUS restaurant attached to museum--we had lunch there and it was excellent. Could spend the day here!",
          "A fine art museum worth a visit. During my stay at Gothenburg the museum hosted a Van Gogh exibition. The museums own Collections are also of interest to any art lover. Facilities such as museum shop, toilets, locker rooms, cafe and restaurant are just fine.",
          "This is a bit of an odd museum - not very attractive and you do get the feeling that it needs a lick of paint (especially on the upper floors) but it did have a good mix of old and new with the few Monet, Matisse, Picasso and Van Gough's - next to some new artists.",
          "Very nice collection and a fantastically robust and nice building. Some of the most pristine works of Swedish masters can be found here, presented in a very pedagogic way. Make sure to check for local offers as your ticket may be valid for more museums around the city.",
          "It's a good museum to spend an afternoon walking around in. It is relaxed and interesting. When you are finished at the Museum of Fine Art, you can pop down the street to visit the design museum and have a coffee/cake there. The ticket is valid for both places. The only con",
          "I was lucky enough to have an artist take me to see the exhibition that was going on at the time. Always interesting to have somebody explain more background to what you are seeing. But even without that, I found the museum very rich. Different styles, different themes, great",
          "The F\u00fcrstenberg gallery on the 6th floor is something extra ordinary. It's mainly northern art from the late 19th century. F\u00fcrstenberg was patron and friend with the artists. He built his own gallery in his home with windows in the ceiling, that was a novelty from Paris. The",
          "Very interesting contemporary art, and nice to see some classic paintings I've only seen on the internet before, like Carl Larsson, Picasso. The Hasselblad centre photoexhibition was the highlight of the visit though.",
          "Located on the top end of Avenyn in a very imposant building. Quite nice and worth a visit, especially as the ticket price is only 40 SEK which grants you entrance to four other museums as well(!) However, the temporary exhibition was quite uninteresting. We didn't get the",
          "The museum building itself is worth to see. But the different collections are extremely good. They have got over 70.000 art pieces, but only a part is on exhibit. The European15.-17. century collection has some excellent works from Cranach, Bordone, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Rubens.",
          "The Hasselbad gallery and the konsthall were excellent innovative exhibitions but the konstmuseum itself lacked a bit of cutting edge. Good way to pass a couple of hours anyway.",
          "The Museum holds some nice paintings/art from Scandinavian and European artists including Picasso, Van Gogh, Raphael. But the big sculpture gallery was very unique. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This museum is worth several hours. It's well organized and not overwhelming like somelarger museums. It was an easy walk from our downtown hotel.",
          "A great selection and logical timeline of Nordic art, well worth a visit. Go first to the 5th floor and then go up, do the two main floors in time logical order and take time to read the synopsis in each room of the styles and periods. This collection really gives a bit of",
          "It was under construction but it was very nice and there are many, many floors of art from the 1700s I think all the way down to now! Free of charge if you're under 25 years of age, I have a vlog about it if you'd want to see a sneak peak",
          "We had a terrific time wandering the halls of the museum. The art was fantastic. Okay, the giant stripperp pole wasn't my thing but the Picassos were great!",
          "Lovely Picassos and some very interesting Swedish paintings from the 1930's. It is a quiet museum and easy to navigate. There isn't a huge amount to see but it is a worthwhile visit. Also good to note the square outside as there are interesting 1930's buildings and a great",
          "We enjoyed our visit and found the special exhibitions worth the visit in itself (photography and a Finnish artist). While there were a few good European pictures and statues most were Scandinavian artists from Norway, Denmark and Sweden which we found refreshing.",
          "Considering the rather low price of the entry ticket, I believe it's worth visiting. There are interesting paintings (including a Van Gogh and a few Picasso).",
          "We spent the morning enjoying the different paintings. We' were helped by a docent in three of the rooms that we were in. The art work is varied and interesting. We were offered a museum pass that worked out to be a great deal. Worth a visit",
          "The museum is not big, but that is exactly what helps this museum. Some small museums provide you with just the right art and space to enjoy that art .. this is on of those. Do not expect the best masterpieces but interesting choices. The open spaces and small crowd gives you",
          "Interesting museum but expected to find more. It is quite big and if you do not have enough time, is difficult to explore it.",
          "To visit the museum it's about a ten minute walk from the main shops. It is worth it! The entrance cost is 40kronor but this gains you one years entry to 5 different museums across the city so is very good value. The receptionist advised that you work from the top floor down.",
          "Nice museum, especially the scandinavian paintings are impressive, but there are also some pretty interesting sculptures. Was absolutely worth a visit. .",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Amazing art collection. Cost to get into the museum was about the cost of a coffee.",
          "When I visited Gothenburg in October last year I just had to visit the Gothenburg Art Museum and the F\u00fcrstenberg Collection. It\u2019s just about three rooms but the art is marvellous! You will find exquisite paintings by Carl Larsson, Albert Edelfelt and Anders Zorn as well as many",
          "Great collections and so few people. It's the kind of place you can just go to and enjoy the art, spend minutes contemplating the Van Gogh and just enjoy the moment. Just go there and visit. You won't regret it.",
          "Fantastic choice of exhibits displayed within a great space, well hung. I prefer modern art and there was a great coverage with strong inclusion of Scandinavian artists. Very enjoyable exhibition and if you have only have time to visit one museum when in Gothenburg I'd",
          "As far as art galleries go this is one of the best. Great range of paintings in style and period. Really well hung. You can tell someone has given this real thought. The restaurant does nice coffee too.",
          "There was an exhibition of photography with a well documented memory lane as the oldest camera and latest cameras faced off! a lot about Sweden and the older days..",
          "We liked the atmosphere in the museum as well as the opportunity to see some scandinavian art. There were also some very good paintings by the masters.",
          "The museum is lovely, showing both Swedish artists and renowned international artists like Chagall, Picasso and Monet. The buidling itself forms a lovely frame for the paintings. I especially enjoyed the paintings of Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors. The toilets and the",
          "A mix of old classics, and some newer bits and pieces makes for a strange but interesting mix. Unusally quiet I thought, but this was a nice change from London Art Museums. There was a Photo exhibition downstairs and some very modern displays in there as well. All in all it made",
          "Here can you see them all , the big artists... From the Scandinavian painters to the Europes and out in the world. It\u00b4s a museum in light and beautiful arrenged paintings. And do not forget to visit Hasselblad photos expo.",
          "Small but excellent collection. A lot of Swedish work, and some fine impressionists. Definitely worth a visit and your ticket gains entry a many other museums",
          "I went to this museum to occupy a rainy day. I had relatively low expectations, but I was quite impressed with the collection. I was lucky enough to catch a special exhibition on Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard; oddly enough, it included an original Hokusai, the first one I've",
          "Anders Zorn, Carl Larsson, and many more both older and contemporary. Well curated and thoughtfully presented throughout. Also a fabulous restaurant, Mr. P, attached.",
          "I was there in Oct. 2014. They showed the work of Vivian Maier, a almost unknown photographer from the US, some gothic landscapes (not sure if this is really kind of art, but interesting) and van Goth as well as Rodin. 100 SEK for all is not too expensive. The permanent",
          "We visited the Konstmuseum to see the display of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard exhibit and it was wonderful. We also had a chance to see the Vivian Meier photography display and that was also a highlight for us. All in all, an excellent museum.",
          "A fair selection of local and international art. Some of the Reubens were very good. Sculptures above average. About 2 hours worth.",
          "A rather eclectic collection of paintings and some sculpture, of course mostly Swedish and Scandinavian, but with some unexpected gems from elsewhere. I also lucked into a Van Gogh, Gauguin, Bernard special exhibit (until mid-October 2014). The museum closes at 5 pm on most",
          "We were surprised that we saw so many very well known painters in this museum. The place is also in the center of the city and very easely to find.",
          "A must visit if you are indulgent in fine art or appreciate art and painting. They also have separate exhibitions but which costs extra. the Ticket to Kunstmuseum also covers 4 other museums: Sjofartmuseum, Rohoska museum,Kunstmuseum and 1 more(cant remember the name).",
          "This museum has a very considerable collection of paintings of Anders Zorn, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, Carl Larsson, among others. Do not miss the beautiful autumn paintings of Carl Larsson: October and November. The temporary exhibition",
          "I'm not a massive art lover but to find a exhibition with Van Gogh, Gaugain, Bernard and even a Bacon was a bonus. Added to the residential Monet, Rodin and others, a very wide & unexpected collection. Well worth the visit.",
          "A really nice exhibition spreading out on a great location just on top if the avenue, stroll through the exhibit and enjoy the view as well. Enjoyed the temporary van Gogh cezanne exhibit a lot",
          "If you are familiar with classic, modern and contemporary visual arts this museum is the must visit destination in G\u00f6teborg for you. Temporary exhibitions, Van Gogh exhibition opened last weekend and the collection representing the vibrant mix of sculpture, painting and",
          "This is a wonderful opportunity to see art by artists who worked and earned their first fame in Sweden. Anders Zorn, for example, was well represented, along with others from the nineteenth century. There were also French Impressionists to give these Swedish artists an",
          "There are many different exhibitions at work at the same time at this museum, which I think is great. It's hard to take in everything at one time, but when you pay the entrance fee you get free entrance for the rest of the year so you can go back any time you want. My favourite",
          "I have to admit that I had low expectations going in because I hardly knew anything about Goteborg as a city. There are some classic gems by big-name masters but also many Scandinavian artists presented in parallel with more familiar French and Dutch movements. I found it",
          "For a relatively small city the art museum has a lot on offer. Originals from many famous artists both international as well as Swedish. Well worth a few hours",
          "Not to be missed. The selections on Scandinavian art contains several gems worth seeing. Its a large place but still very doable in a short period of time.",
          "Some of the art was a bit eccentric and abstract for us but we really enjoyed the Hassleblad exhibition.",
          "They exhibit a lot of Swedish paintings and some sculptures that might be very interesting for Swedish people... maybe not so exciting for foreigners...",
          "A great collection of 19/20 century art on the top floor. Floor below is 17/8 which is not really my cup of tea, but a wonderful collection. It is really interesting to see the parallels between Scandinavian art and what was happening in the rest of Europe. They had a great",
          "The Gothenburg Museum of Art houses collections from the 15th century to today. The museum has a Nordic emphasis but the collections also contain older Dutch and French art, including important works by Rembrandt, van Gogh, Monet and Picasso, to name a few. The Gothenburg",
          "I knew nothing of Swedish art when I entered .... I suggest starting on the top floor and descending slowly ... Lots to see",
          "Excellent collection of Scandinavian Art from 1880 to 1920 with highlights Munch, Zorn, Carl Larsson, Bruno Liljefors, Ernst Josefsson among others. International highlights must be Rembrant, Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh, Leger all of top quality.",
          "I discovered here the works of famous artist I have never seen before in books. Picasso, Chagall, Van Gogh, Munk were represented with unknown to me works. And the museum is not overloaded with information.",
          "The collection is much better than my expectation. Some of famous paintings including Picaso and Monet are worth looking at. Less popular Scandinavian painters' works are also good to understand the development history of painting in Scandinavia. The annex photo museum",
          "Art work was ok with some big names but there was just no atmosphere, hardly any other visitors in there, and it was poorly lit so it was all a bit depressing!",
          "Many fine art works from 19th and 20th century Scandinavian painters and sculptors. This time also an interesting temporary photo exhibition.",
          "Spent several hours at the gallery and the lack of visitors though bad for the museum for great for me. Plenty of time to contemplate the fantastic range of art works! A gem!",
          "Fabulous, take time here. Though I loved the museum I should have allotted more time. They have a very nice permanent collection and the staff I spoke to in the galleries were very helpful.",
          "nice museum with very beautiful wide ranged modern art ; one of the stops of the hop on hop off bus and both included in the Gothenburg card",
          "We visited the Fine Art Museum because my partner particularly wanted to see the Hasselblad Center exhibits, but we were very glad we had the time to explore some* of the rest of the Museum. Although we visited on a Sunday the space was not at all crowded and there was no sense",
          "I learned a lot about Northern European art and saw some excellent art in general with no crowds on a Wed. night in July. Ate a lovely dinner at the restaurant that is on the terrace of the museum overlooking a large plaza and the statue of Poseidon.",
          "A museum full of eclectic pieces of art, paintings and photographs. I did not have to pay a fee and was allowed to take my camera inside. A beautiful way to spend a few hours in the afternoon.",
          "This is an older museum with exhibits confined to rooms in a very easy to maneuver way. I really like the arrangement by art periods and realized quickly that their impressionism and modern were well stocked collections. Interesting temporary chi it's filled sow of the space.",
          "they have Always a good exhibition to see and their ordinary paintings are just fine. The small cafe and shop are good as well.",
          "The art museum was a highlight of my trip to Gothenburg, the extensive collection had works from many of the great masters. The rooms are small so you can enjoy the art without distraction.",
          "Worth spending time to walk around and absorb the different art. The collection is arranged chronologically and geographically, with some interesting thematic inserts.",
          "It depends on which temporary collection there is. The building is really big and beautiful from the outside, but it seems to be that not every floor of the museum is used as exposition space. Under 25 is free!",
          "I wanted to see the Hasselblad collection, which is in the MoFA building. I've never seen a display that was as carelessly put together as this one. I will just mention Rodin's gorgeous statue of Balzac, in a corner against a dirty wall next to a dirty door, on a pedestal that",
          "I expected to spend a lot of time here considering there were 6 floors to cover but was round in no time at all. Went to the restaurant at lunchtime but left without eating after failing to get anyone's attention.",
          "One rainy day we visited Konstmuseum. Exellent collection. The house itself interesting. Good restaurant to visit. What more you need??",
          "Good Gallery with some nice picassos and fine examples of the best Scandinavian art and the Gothenburg art School.",
          "The museum is devided into several showrooms representing different eras. I loved the bookstore in it and bought lots of books and gifts from it :-)",
          "Simply, an outstanding collection beautifully presented. Extremely large specialty built Museum. While lit. Lots of steps. Part of the Museum in G\u00f6teborg chain, where your $8 ticket is good for all of museums for one year. Recommend it to anybody interested in art.",
          "Great collections, especially the F\u00fcrstenberg Gallery on top floor if you are looking for Scandinavian artists and the special Nordic light. Impressive building.",
          "Museum has a quite good collection however lack of imagination of ppl responsible for special exhibitions is painful. I visited exhibit dedicated to August Strindberg and i found it boring, not to say disrespectful for one of the greatest artist in the history of Sweden. I did",
          "A rather impressive collection for a small-ish city. Hopefully they will invest in an audio guide or at least more comprehensive print material to help visitors better appreciate some of the very nice pieces in the permanent collection.",
          "I found the collection underwhelming...small and a little confused. They had a special exhibit that was interesting. The special exhibit we paid extra for was not what we thought it would be...",
          "Really imposing building which contains both the Art Museum and the Hasselblad centre. Fantastic value and a really really great museum. Really worth a visit to see fantastic art and photography, contemporary as well as classical.",
          "The range of exhibitions and the building itself it worth a visist. Lovely, helpful staff too. The cafe isn't working at the moment but there are a lot of bars nearby",
          "You don\u2019t want to miss this museum. It was a surprise to see such a nice collection, including Nordic renaissance and a great impressionist collection",
          "This had some interesting Nordic exhibits, with some good stuff by Carl Larsson, although there was less there than we thought, given the size of the place. Unfortunately the Hasselblad gallery was being refitted at the time of our visit, but it didn't look great from what we",
          "This museum has a very good selection of Flemish and Dutch masters as well as French impressionists. However, the main attraction is on the top floor, where you find a phenomenal selection of Nordic art. The museum is reasonably priced and centrally located.",
          "Must see! Many interesting items by local/Scandinavian artists, which cannot be seen in other places",
          "We started our day of sightseeing in Gothenburg here (and in the associated Hasselblad photo museum, which we found a little disappointing). In the art museum itself, we particularly appreciated the Swedish work including by local 19th-early 20th century painters but were",
          "This was a nice sized museum that even attracted my teenagers. They had the Andy Warhol exhibit when we visited. The downstairs smelled of the homebaked cookies made in the cafe! Under 25 is free, which I think is great to encourage younger people to enjoy the arts. Had a great",
          "Personally I prefer modern art, so I went for the Bacon/Warhol exhibition which was small but enjoyable. When I ventured upstairs to the permanent collection was disappointing. There was a mix of slightly more modern art in with the older stuff (some cubism and impressionism)",
          "Wonderful museum. A great collection of old and modern collections. Highly recommend",
          "I didn't know I would find a Rembrandt painting at this museum, but I also didn't expect to be blown away by paintings by painters I never heard of. This museum is well worth seeking out!",
          "I recently visited the museum while in Gothenburg in early May 2012. As most museums they are closed on Mondays. The day I was there they opened at 11:00am. One FYI: if you have any big bags or coats they will make u rent a locker (need a 5 krona coin). They attendant forgot",
          "Very good with long Wednesday opening hours. All museums should work longer hours than shops since people would go there when they are done with shopping. At least me. This is a great museum with good temporary exhibitions and Hasselblad center that shows great photos few times",
          "This museum may come as a positive surprise for some visitors. It has an excellent collection of European and especially Scandinavian art. In the so called F\u00fcrstenberg gallery, which was originally a private collection, some of the most famous Scandinavian painters like Ernst",
          "An excellent selection of Scandinavian art, both old and new; a good mix, and a delightful cafe to have a break in between soaking up the art. Free to under 25s which is excellent.",
          "Very good art museum. Friendly and helpful staff. Some very good paintings. Could be recommended when visiting this nice city.",
          "This is a very nice museum and pretty big with a very good collection mostly Scandinavian art and traveling exhibitions, a must if you are in Gothenborg",
          "I have been to Gothenburg several times but never managed to get myself to the Fine Art Museum - until now. I must say I was rather surprised, the collections and the museum was much more impressive then I had imagined, the nordic art collections as well as the international.",
          "there are couple of the requisite Van Goch, Picasso, Monet, Manet works and some interesting work from the Rembrandt school, but nothing really wow. Also some renaissance paintings. The highlight ofr me was the Swedish period art. Very interesting. and a pair of Conrad Botes",
          "Very nice art museum. Intersting exhibitions. A must to do in Gothenburg.",
          "In a beautiful building, nice layout (not cluttered). Cheap to get in (4kr, free if you're under 25, and your entry ticket is valid for a few other museums, natural history and city museum being ones we visited), and a nice mix of recent work and sculpture with the more familiar",
          "I always make a point of visiting art museums wherever I travel. Overall, it's a very pleasant museum--you don't often get to see the work of Swedish artists. I enjoyed the Carl Larssons' very much. HOWEVER. How many people in the world speak Swedish...2%? If you're trying to",
          "I specifically visited the museum to see the Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo exhibition and was not disappointed. It was an excellent exhibition and not crowded at all (unlike many exhibitions at more well-known museums in other European cities). The exhibition is on the 6th floor",
          "I like the way the art works are being curated here. They are easily accesible and easily understood in terms of the period and artists. The only thing that can be improved is that not all artworks come with English descriptions. There is a special offer now in which you",
          "Not only will you get to see many of the great classics you already know you want to see - pieces by Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, etc. - you will also get to see works by many Nordic artists over the years, which you really don't get the opportunity to see outside this region. A",
          "Most of this large art museum's permanent collection is not on display now,including its Rembrandts,Jordaens,Monets,Gauguins,and Larsens.Nevertheless,I saw fine Swedish Colorist paintings by Carl Kyllberg(\"Harvest Landscape\")and Scandanavian Self Portraits by Jean Heiberg,Karl"

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum. On 29 December 2004, the Museum of World Culture opened near Korsv\u00e4gen. Museums include the Gothenburg Museum of Art, and several museums of sea and navigation history, natural history, the sciences, and East India. Aeroseum, close to the G\u00f6teborg City Airport, is an aircraft museum in a former military underground air force base. The Volvo museum has exhibits of the history of Volvo and the development from 1927 until today. Products shown include cars, trucks, marine engines, and buses.Universeum is a public science centre that opened in 2001, the largest of its kind in Scandinavia. It is divided into six sections, each containing experimental workshops and a collection of reptiles, fish, and insects. Universeum occasionally host debates between Swedish secondary-school students and Nobel Prize laureates or other scholars.\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThe most noted attraction is the amusement park Liseberg, located in the central part of the city. It is the largest amusement park in Scandinavia by number of rides, and was chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes. It is the most popular attraction in Sweden by number of visitors per year (more than 3 million).There are a number of independent theatre ensembles in the city, besides institutions such as Gothenburg City Theatre, Backa Theatre (youth theatre), and Folkteatern.The main boulevard is called Kungsportsavenyn (commonly known as Avenyn, \"The Avenue\"). It is about 1 km (0.6 mi) long and starts at G\u00f6taplatsen \u2013 which is the location of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, the city's theatre, and the city library, as well as the concert hall \u2013 and stretches all the way to Kungsportsplatsen in the old city centre of Gothenburg, crossing a canal and a small park. The Avenyn was created in the 1860s and 1870s as a result of an international architecture contest, and is the product of a period of extensive town planning and remodelling. Avenyn has Gothenburg's highest concentration of pubs and clubs. Gothenburg's largest shopping centre (8th largest in Sweden), Nordstan, is located in central Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg's Haga district is known for its picturesque wooden houses and its caf\u00e9s serving the well-known Haga bulle \u2013 a large cinnamon roll similar to the kanelbulle.Five Gothenburg restaurants have a star in the 2008 Michelin Guide: 28 +, Basement, Fond, Kock & Vin, Fiskekrogen, and Sj\u00f6magasinet.\nThe city has a number of star chefs \u2013 over the past decade, seven of the Swedish Chef of the Year awards have been won by people from Gothenburg.The Gustavus Adolphus pastry, eaten every 6 November in Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus Day, is especially connected to, and appreciated in, Gothenburg because the city was founded by King Gustavus Adolphus.One of Gothenburg's most popular natural tourist attractions is the southern Gothenburg archipelago, which is a set of several islands that can be reached by ferry boats mainly operating from Saltholmen. Within the archipelago are the \u00c4lvsborg fortress, Vinga and Styrs\u00f6 islands.\n\n\n=== Festivals and fairs ===\n\nThe annual Gothenburg Film Festival, is the largest film festival in Scandinavia.

In June 2012, the festival included bands such as In Flames, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Lamb of God, and Mastodon. Another popular festival, Way Out West, focuses more on rock, electronic, and hip-hop genres.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nAs in all of Sweden, a variety of sports are followed, including football, ice hockey, basketball, handball, baseball, and figure skating. A varied amateur and professional sports clubs scene exists.Gothenburg is the birthplace of football in Sweden as the first football match in Sweden was played there in 1892. The city's three major football clubs, IFK G\u00f6teborg, \u00d6rgryte IS, and GAIS share a total of 34 Swedish championships between them. IFK has also won the UEFA Cup twice. Other notable clubs include BK H\u00e4cken (football), Pixbo Wallenstam IBK (floorball), multiple national handball champion Redbergslids IK, and four-time national ice hockey champion Fr\u00f6lunda HC, Gothenburg had a professional basketball team, Gothia Basket, until 2010 when it ceased. The bandy department of GAIS, GAIS Bandy, played the first season in the highest division Elitserien last season. The group stage match between the main rivals Sweden and Russia in the 2013 Bandy World Championship was played at Arena Heden in central Gothenburg.The city's most notable sports venues are Scandinavium, and Ullevi (multisport) and the newly built Gamla Ullevi (football).\nThe 2003 World Allround Speed Skating Championships were held in Rudhallen, Sweden's only indoor speed-skating arena. It is a part of Ruddalens IP, which also has a bandy field and several football fields.The only Swedish heavyweight champion of the world in boxing, Ingemar Johansson, who took the title from Floyd Paterson in 1959, was from Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg has hosted a number of international sporting events including the 1958 FIFA World Cup, the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, an NFL preseason game on 14 August 1988 between the Chicago Bears and the Minnesota Vikings, the 1992 European Football Championship, the 1993 and the 2002 World Men's Handball Championship, the 1995 World Championships in Athletics, the 1997 World Championships in Swimming (short track), the 2002 Ice Hockey World Championships, the 2004 UEFA Cup final, the 2006 European Championships in Athletics, and the 2008 World Figure Skating Championships.

The annual Gothia Cup, is the world's largest football tournament with regards to the number of participants: in 2011, a total of 35,200 players from 1,567 teams and 72 nations participated.\nGothenburg hosted the XIII FINA World Masters Championships in 2010. Diving, swimming, synchronized swimming and open-water competitions were held on 28 July to 7 August. The water polo events were played on the neighboring city of Bor\u00e5s.Gothenburg is also home to the Gothenburg Sharks, a professional baseball team in the Elitserien division of baseball in Sweden.With around 25,000 sailboats and yachts scattered about the city, sailing is a popular sports activity in the region, particularly because of the nearby Gothenburg archipelago. In June 2015, the Volvo Ocean Race, professional sailing's leading crewed offshore race, concluded in Gothenburg, as well as an event in the 2015\u20132016 America's Cup World Series in August 2015.The Gothenburg Amateur Diving Club (G\u00f6teborgs amat\u00f6rdykarklubb) Has been operating since October 1938.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDue to Gothenburg's advantageous location in the centre of Scandinavia, trade and shipping have always played a major role in the city's economic history, and they continue to do so. Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies. The blue-collar industries which have dominated the city for long are still important factors in the city's economy, but they are being gradually replaced by high-tech industries.Banking and finance are also important, as well as the event and tourist industry.Gothenburg is the terminus of the Valdemar-G\u00f6teborg gas pipeline, which brings natural gas from the North Sea fields to Sweden, through Denmark.Historically, Gothenburg was home base from the 18th century of the Swedish East India Company. From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "Gothenburg was in the midst of a heat wave, the museum has no AC, it was hot and stuffy BUT so interesting that we spent 2 hours and could have spent another hours or so but we ran out of time. Great exhibit on the Vikings, the city has an interesting history. Most explanations",
          "We enjoyed this museum, we really did, but we couldn't give a higher score because we felt that it isn't fulfilling it's full potential. For the amount of space available to work with, much more items could of been assembled to be displayed; especially the viking section. The",

          "We did not allow enough time to see everything in this musuem [you will need at least 2 - 21/2 hrs] but what we enjoyed it all the same. Fantastic historical treasures from as far back as the 12th century. There are ipad displays for most sections and you can select eack item on",
          "There are several temporary exhibits on a variety of themes as well as the permanent exhibits. In preparation for the 400th anniversary of Gothenburg in 2021, they recently opened an exhibit on the birth of Gothenburg. This exhibit is kid-friendly and very informative.",

          "I was back at the City Museum to try the new exhibit about the birth of the city. The exhibition makes a good job of introducing the story of western Sweden in the 15th and 16th century, the backdrop for Goteborg creation. Two movies, sounds, maps, artefacts, the museum made",

          "It is small and a number of the exhibits were closed for renovation. It is nice enough and most exhibits are translated into English. One gets a sense of the evolution of the city through time, although the section on the founding was closed, so the narrative is broken up. The",

          "This museum is very near our home when we are living in Sweden. It's not a big museum but it seems to offer a lot. There are a fair number of displays. However, where I think it really shines is the kid-friendly space upstairs. You can get a yearly museum pass for quite",

          "This is a very well presented museum highlighting Gothenburg and Sweden through the ages, my favourite part was the Viking exhibition with a long ship on display. It is good for a rainy day or the extra few hours you have to spare. It is close to hip cafes and the canal.",
          "Visited on my last day in town because I had time to kill. Entry is only 40kr which gets you into four other museums in the city, with validity until the end of the year (a season ticket, basically). Take a 5kr coin for the locker room. Most (but not all) information is also",
          "I'm not the most patient museum visitor and get bored very quickly, however I found this a great place to visit. One of the 5 museums for 40 SEK that you can visit on a single ticket. The Viking ship may not be complete but it is a fascinating exhibit. There is a lot about how",
          "The historical exhibits give a nice colorful overview of starting with prehistoric times. There are good explanations in English. The museum has the remains of a Viking boat, plus some nice Viking artifacts. Again, explanations in English are very good. We moved quickly through",

          "I visited the City Muesum as recommended by the Goteburg City Card with the entry being free. This musuem is ok but not the best that Gothenburg has to offer. It has some good exhibits which included the viking ship but the rest wasn't really awe inspiring. I'm glad I went",
          "If you are under 25 and in Gbg, do go visit this place. The entry is free for under 25, you can see a bunch of cool stuff regarding this city's history. Go up to the last floor and you'll find an interesting music exibition about Gbg music life :)",

          "The museum is interesting although it hasn't got a lot to offer. The viking ship is the most advertised attraction but I believe the top of the visit is a 4500-years-old skeleton.",
          "Much to see and very informative. You buy your ticket and can go for free in the natural history or arts museum at 40sek. Loved it.",
          "This is a good value museum without having any 'wow' for the average tourist. However, the floor showing the development of music in Gothenburg is brilliant. Very well put together, you can listen to lots of different genres and the dancing booth with examples and practice is",
          "Based in the building of the East India Company (no, I didn't know Sweden had one too!) this museum has some excellent information and artefacts, particularly around the viking era, including the oldest / most complete viking boat in the world. The craftmanship and technology",

          "The entry fee was worth it for the excellent Viking history exhibit which includes the amazing nine hundred year old remains of a Viking trading ship dug up from the mud in the 1930's plus jewellery and objects from the Viking era. The rest of the museum contains objects",
          "Considering entree was only 40 SEK, this museum was a great value. Cool exhibit on Vikings and prehistoric Sweden. Worth a visit, probably only an hour or two. Has information in English but the text is in light green making it difficult to read :/",
          "Attractive interior layout with some exhibits more interesting than others. The exhibit on prehistory was only ok and plaques talked about that time period generally rather than what was happening in Gothenburg. The far more interesting exhibits are on 18th-19th centuries. Lots",
          "We went primarily to see the Viking ship. though little remains of it. The museum is one of the many attractions available with the City Card (also free trams, buses and ferries). It is currently under renovation, so two large sections are unavailable, having said that the rest",

          "Stadmuseum is a great opportunity to get knowing the Gothenburg city. It has everything in one building, starting from Viking history up to modern times. The best thing is that you can buy a single ticket (40 SEK for adult) and visit this museum for many times, because it is",

          "An interesting tour of Gothenburgs history from the earliest settlement of the area, through the Viking age, and up until today. The pre-historic part was frustrating, since it didn't tell the date or find location of most of the artefacts. The Viking cargo ship, and extensive",

          "This was a very interesting museum with lots to see. There was the right amount of exhibits and the right amount of information about them. It is well laid out and there is something for adults and children alike. The cafe was superb, for 59 SEK we had a huge lunch with drinks",
          "Stopped in here to see the photography exhibit based on the musical history of g\u00f6teborg and we were not disappointed one bit. It was a great exhibit with sections set up indicative of the particular genre. There was music to listen to via iPad's which was a novel touch. The rest",
          "Good museum on the history of the city with models of city construction phases. Very informative and not that expensive, you get a ticket to naval museum also for reasonable price. Both worth the visit.",
          "I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this museum. I was impressed to find out that the city of Goteborg was practically fully designed by Dutch settlers and architects. It was also made \"Dane's proof\" as the Swedish considered the Danes their worse enemies. The building is",

          "A great place to experience an extensive history of Gothenburg. An extensive and spacious museum with well presented exhibits and mostly wheelchair accessible via a number of elevators. Great place to spend a rainy day.",
          "Great little museum that gives you some history of the city. Well worth visiting and spending an afternoon here. Also, the admission cost is cheap and it allows you to get into four other museums within the city for free! Can't beat that!",
          "Free entry for people under 25, so I was very happy about that. The museum itself is quite small in comparison to other museums, but I felt that this was more of a strength than a weakness. It meant that all of the content needed to well curated to keep you interested, because",

          "We visited the museum today and found it a great way to spend some time in the city of G\u00f6teborg. Although the exhibits are somewhat limited, the ones presented are interesting, especially the Viking exhibit. It would have been interesting to have more on the Norse gods. Nice",
          "Visited on an early morning in September, I think I was one of the first people to walk in and it was great. I had time to read and look at the art and the evolution of the city. Very interesting. I loved the Viking section. You cannot miss that! I also enjoyed the way they",

          "I thought this museum was okay. We were lucky to go on a free day, so that helps with my review. I thought some of the rooms were interesting, but they varied as to whether they were in Swedish or English. As an English speaker, it was difficult to enjoy all the rooms since",
          "the museum is set in a beautiful old building along the river, very central part of the city. Inexpensive entrance fee, good facilities inside and a nice overview of the city. Some exhibitions have English but just as many do not, no problem, we just enjoyed looking at the",
          "There are several sections of this museum, and even though I wasn't interested in the modern art, or music sections, the historical aspects are well worth the visit. There are fascinating pictures and information about a children's (hospital and orphanage I think). It's heart",

          "A nice survey of the history of the area. Good section exploring changes in Swedish culture. The building is also good example of fine Swedish architecture",
          "The museum gives a brief overview about the history, starting with the Vikings and ending up somewhere in the 19-somewhat. So new Gothenborg does not exist. Most of the exhibition is also in English, but not 100 %. Frankly spoken, I have seen better ones, done with more care.",
          "I went here hoping to learn all about the city's past with regards to the Danish/Swedish wars. This wasn't really covered - at least not that I could find. Quite a few of the exhibitions aren't in English, too. There is a Viking section with an actual Viking boat on display",
          "Just the history of Gothenburg and surrounds. Enough for about 2 hours. The viking ship was cool. Could have done with a better souvenir shop.",
          "Brilliant - as my great grandfather was a mariner this was a must for us. We were not disappointed. Highly recommend this venue on your Goteborg visit.",
          "The museum was full of exhibits on the 15th,16th,17th and 18th century history of Gothenburg. It is worth spending a couple of hours there.",
          "The viking collection was interesting, but I found the rest of the museum rather boring. Most of the exhibits (if not all) had explanations in English.",
          "Nice exhibits... had lunch at Mr. P. The restaurant is part of the complex... quite handy and the food is great!",
          "Museum is interesting. Most of the exhibits had English explanations. There were interactive parts in most of the exhibits. You can eat food you brought in the lobby area.",
          "Never enough time to see everything but fascinating chronological layout with some temporary installations too.some sections only had wording in Swedish which was a shame but the majority was accessible including video loop in Swedish and English. In one section. Particularly",
          "Viking ship is a bit pants - much better ones in Oslo! The section on medieval history is only in Swedish, but the later rooms that trace expansion of the city, planning of the walls and canals, role of the city in trade and in Sweden's short-lived imperial ambitions are all in",
          "I took relatives here a couple of times and then stopped doing that. The collections are haphazard, uninteresting and the information in English was poor. Very disappointing.",
          "An interesting guide to the area through the millennia - a great way to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "Go: 1) If you are interested why G\u00f6teborg reminds a typical dutch city with all its channels and bridges; 2) If you travelling with curious kids - they will be occupied with museum quest and very good playground on the top floor; 3) If you like to explore an old building,",
          "it's one more museum with nothing special. I was expecting to see more detail on the history of the city.",
          "A nice little museum with a good (but small) section about Vikings and the remains of a Viking boat on display. Very cheap to enter, and the ticket also gets you into a few other museums such as the Maritime Museum. Good museum for a short visit, most (but not all) captions",
          "This museum offers a fascinating ruin of a Viking ship. What I liked best, however, were aspects of earlier material culture. You could see Swedish design in the making: old bits of houses, things dug up by archaeologists, etc. This helped us understand Sweden. Recommended if",
          "The Viking exhibit was fascinating and compelling. It was very well done, with signage in English and Swedish. The museum also had exhibits on the rest of the history of g\u00f6teborg, which were also well put together, but for me the Vikings exhibit was the best part of the museum.",
          "The Stadsmuseum has a small but beautiful exhibit on Viking culture and arts with signature in Swedish and English. The large room on early Christian art is extraordinary; its only failing is the exclusive use of Swedish. The objects, however, tell their own eloquent story.",
          "The part about the older history was nice, but the younger history, the part we came there for, was - well, not impressive. You\u00b4ll get some pieces from the citys story, and you\u00b4ll get i cheap. The fee will let you enter several other museums too during you stay. That\u00b4s good!",
          "This is worth going to. The Viking ship on display is the only one in Sweden and helps make sense of the Viking culture. Some myths are definitely exploded. The history of the city is done well. The exhibits are done in both English and Swedish in the main. At the moment",
          "You can see some wonderful works by European masters in this lovely museum, and it's in the center of town, so enjoy the environment as well.",

          "The good: This small museum fools you in thinking there's not much to see but it is quite the opposite! The only exhibited Viking ship (well, what is left of it) and the adjoining exhibition about the Vikings is a MUST SEE! Well done and most of the museums exhibits are",
          "Located right in the old part of town on the canal, this museum offers an interesting history of the area. I was impressed with the Viking display, which includes the remains of a Viking ship. There are good descriptions in English and Swedish [at least up to the Viking era].",
          "You can learn about history there, a lot of things to do, and a really nice playground if you have children",
          "Really enjoyed this museum - especially the viking part and learning about Gothenburg through the ages. Everything in english too, staff helpful, great entrance price at 40 kr which also gets you into the art museum and other places on the same ticket.",
          "I wanted my teenage daughters to know a little bit about Gothenburg's history, not just be familiar with the shopping centers down town, so I convinced them that it would be worth spending 2 hours at \"Stadsmuseet\". After a bit hesitation they followed me. I was surprised how",
          "Great value for the entry fee. The Viking exhibit is really cool! Almost everything is translated into English. Follow the history of Gothenburg from the Stone Age to almost present times. We really enjoyed it!",
          "museum with a broad overview of the Swedish history and culture; free entrance with the Gothenburg card",
          "It was kind of a mash up of things, but very interesting. We were quite disappointed because the English displays for items disappeared about halfway through the museum. I would have liked to have known what I was looking at. We had a good time though and the displays were great!",
          "Nice museum that give you a great insight in the history of Gothenburg. Best of all I like the prehistoric exhibition, really interesting especially the thing from viking age. I think it\u00b4s well worth a visit.",
          "The reason I went to this museum and for me the reason to go was the Viking exhibition. The famous Viking boat was, admittedly, pretty much a bunch of boards in the vague shape of a boat. But it was fascinating to be in the presence of something so old and imbued with such",
          "The Viking section and the bit about prehistoric man is what really made this museum come alive for my family, with all of us enjoying looking at the various exhibits.",
          "We really enjoy this museum after they built the new play area for small kids. The entrance fee is also low, and it lasts for the whole year.",

          "Good overview of Gothenburg's history and a great first stop if you like knowing the history of the place before you truly explore it. It was fairly quiet when I visited, but the attractions were interesting and there was even an area geared towrd children. My only problem was",
          "It was a nice an quiet museum overall. Small if compared to one in London or in Washington. Free with Goteborg card and ok to spend an hour or so strolling around.",
          "Recently refurbished, this museum tells the story of Gothenburg from prehistory to the present day. As well as the usual runes and bustles, it has the remains of the only viking ship on permanent display in Sweden. The 40kr. entry fee also gains access to the Art , Design and",
          "I didn't expect too much, but this ended up being one of the highlights of the city. We learned a little more about Vikings, but more importantly, there were a lot of great things about how the city has grown. Perhaps not interesting for kids under 14, but for adults",
          "Somewhat interesting but also disappointing at the same time. Viking \"ship\" is really just a few bits of wood. Very little information on Viking history or lifestyle. What there is rather disjointed. Other displays unremarkable but dated.",
          "I think this museum is as common as others but here you can have a look to the history of Gothenburg.",
          "If you have some time in your hands, this is definitely a good place to go to in Gothenburg. For just 40SEK, you have access to an interesting exhibit about the history of the city, from pre-historic times to the modern day. This is a large, very complete museum in which you",
          "Paid 40Kr per person to get in, which is a bargain. Wasn't so much impressed by the Viking exhibit as I've seen better in Norway, and was more happy with their other exhibits showcasing the history of the area and of Swedish culture. Incidentally, the ticket you pay to get into",
          "My husband and I were in G\u00f6teborg for the Easter weekend and thought we would be left with nothing to do, but fortunately, several museums were open, much to our delight! The City Museum is a clean and modern museum in a beautiful old building. One of the delightful things",

          "If you have half an hour to spare, this museum could be worth a visit. It could be interesting as it sheds light on the immigration and emigration of Swedes in Gothenburg in the 19th century (police records did not begin until 1869).",
          "This museum has several floors of exhibits depicting life in Gothenburg over the centuries. A wonderful way to learn about the history of this city.",
          "A must to see, even you have to walk a lot , buts when its not raining its nicel",
          "This passed an hour or so, but is quite a small and traditional (most things in glass cabinets) museum showing the history of Gothenburg.",
          "Both my 7 y. o. and I really enjoyed this museum. The Viking exhibit was interesting, with the remains of the original Viking boat. (The boat remains are spread out flat, not as a reconstructed boat, and I think my son was disappointed). I liked the building itself, as it old",
          "This is an excellent museum covering the history of the city from prehistoric times, to Viking times, through the more recent growth due to international trade in the 17th to 20th centuries. Most of the captions have English translations. Note that for the two galleries that"

There were all types of ships in the very large outdoor (seaside) display, including fishing trawlers, warships, commercial fishing boats, and sailboats of various sizes.",

          "The boats were very interesting but the U-boat in particular was excellent! It's an exciting climb into it and a bit daunting but it's so interesting inside! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the staff were so demoralised \u2026",
          "Naval museum consisting of old war ships, a mine sweeper and even a submarine that where all in service at some point. The ships can be boarded for a small fee, which is definitely worth it once you get on board. A small and overpriced cafeteria in the first ship you enter, but hey you need to make money somehow, right?",

However it might be difficult for old/very young/fat people to move around, there are a lot of sharp stair cases and ladder for the submarine. You can still visit the other boata that are easier but it's far less interesting...",

          "Highlight for me was the submarine. Loved being able to walk around the boats and see how they would have been. Wish more museums were like this",
          "This is a very interesting attraction in the centre of Gothenburg. We were able to visit a navel destroyer,a submarine and several other ships. The submarine was the highlight of our visit. The cost is reasonable and it was a lovely way to pass a couple of hours.",
          "This Maritime Museum was more than I expected. We were able to walk through many Swedish boats/ships from a submarine to a destroyer to a light ship. It was amazing to go inside these and explore on our own. Descriptions were in English. There were at least 9 to tour. The gift",
          "Battleship, submarine and minesweeper, all decks completely open to visitors. An eyeopener to life as a crew member on such vessels.",
          "I went there in late August and had almost all of the ships for myself. The Destroyer and the submarine are probably the highlights. It is great that you cam almost discover the whole ships, especially the Destroyer. I probably spent 1.5 hours on the ship exploring all the rooms",
          "I stumbled across this museum whilst strolling around Gothenburg. I've never been on a destroyer ship before so I found it so interesting. The highlight for me was the submarine. This was a slightly scary experience being slightly claustrophobic but it was absolutely amazing.",
          "This floating museum has several civil (tugboat, ferry, fire boat) and military (patrol boat, monitor, submarine, destroyer) ships which you can explore. There are some restrictions on access (some compartments are closed off), but for the most part you can walk around, look at,",
          "Very nice experience for a family day. Educational visit for the adults and kids. Good choice for a rainy day",
          "You can climb around some of the vessels more than others. Those you can enter tend to be very good in what you can see. There is an app you can download that provides information in English if you don\u2019t speak Swedish. Once downloaded, you do not need Internet to use.",
          "I spent maybe 40 minutes here with my 3yr old niece, most of that was spent on the destroyer. It was kind of hard to get around with her though as you use the stairs in the ships,as they\u2019re steep and narrow. Plus she had to wear a life jacket. From what I saw all small children",
          "This is the bigger floating museum. You can see several warships and a submarine inside and out. Really interesting for everyone!",
          "I was a bit underwhelmed by the ships. I do think that kids would enjoy this museum. The cost is minimal so interns of value per dollar the museum is a good value.",
          "I stumbled upon this by accident whilst out walking and wasn't disappointed! There are many ships to explore, but the most interesting is HMS Smaland, a destroyer built in the 50's. You can explore all decks, going right down into the bowels of the ship. Better mind you head",
          "Maritiman is part of the Pachuskajen along Gothenburg\u2019s harbour. The Pachuskajen has ships, casino, restaurants, even hotels, the opera house and the Maritiman. This stretch of harbour frontage walkway is well worth the visit. The Maritiman was closed the October Tuesday we",
          "This 'museum' was really cool - a ticket gets you access to several different boats, including the HMS Smaland, which has a submarine attached; you can climb down the hatch and explore inside that, too. I had a lot of fun learning about Swedish naval history. Informational signs",
          "You are able to climb over all the boats and look inside. Would benefit from a multilingual audioguide as a lot of exhibits in Swedish only. Nice boat cafe at entrance",
          "Went thru with friend and 10yrs son and we all were inspired of what we saw. High quality renoveted ships and of course U-boat, which was quite exited place. Lot of history inside ships. I can recommend and please take time to check out without hurry.",
          "Maritiman is a fascinating \"museum\", which allows visitors to see very different kinds of ships from the outside & the inside. There also are two submarines. A special highlight is for sure Swedish navy's ship. You may easily get lost in the small, narrow ways, but yellow arrows",
          "Right downtown, in the harbor you have the opportunity to visit a \u201ccollection\u201d of ships, including a submarine, cargo ship, a destroyer and more.........you can climb aboard and investigate for yourself ! Great fun for the whole family!",

          "Numerous ships to clamber over including a Lightship, Historic Monitor Battleship (minus superstructure), Freighter, Destroyer and Submarine. You need to be somewhat energetic - the destroyer had, I believe 14 levels, so there was a lot of climbing. Access to the submarine is",
          "This is a place I keep coming back to. As I have grown older,much older I do not crawl into the submarine anymore, But my grandkids love it as my chuldren did when they were kids. To be able to get on those boats...no ships! Man the shooting towers! Do not miss it!",
          "I went there with my 5 years daughter and really enjoyed exploring boats and submarine. For a child this is a huge and unrestricted adventure: go there if you a child and let him/her take the leasd in exploring. They will have a great day (not you btw, but they will). :)",
          "We had a wonderful time at the Maritime Museum. The young guide (David) was very knowledgeable and made our visit extra interesting. We never expected to see a Swedish monitor built in the years after the US civil war (the designer of the union ironclad was Swedish). The ships",
          "So many different vessels to visit and explore. My kids absolutely loved wandering around the ships and attempting the different childrens activities. Highly recommended for families and children - it is one of the best of its kind.",
          "This is one of the best tour I have experienced. They have everywhere signes that are very descriptive and written in an interesting way. I spend about 2 hours in there and I learned a lot. The most interesting is the battleship and submarine. The other ships are not that",
          "Visited the Maritime Museum on our recent trip to Gothenburg. Really enjoyed it especially the navy ship and submarine. Would recommend to all.",
          "Unlike other museums, Maritiman encourages you touching items on their ships and really getting hands on! We went there and had Johannes as our tour guide for 40 minutes. During that time, he talked about a number of ships without boring anyone and making great jokes. It is",
          "If you like ships and the sea, you will find this interesting. It's a floating ship museum, including a fireboat, a destroyer and a WWII submarine. Great fun, but may be time for them to add a ship or two to the exhibit, maybe something newer, or an exhibit about new cargo &",
          "A well preserved set of ships and submarine. All of them are in the same area and you can visit them one after the other. You are free to wonder at your own pace. Depending on when you visit, some ships may be inaccessible due to repairs etc but it is worth a visit. I spent alot",
          "Well preserved ships and submaris. All of them in the same area to be visited one after one. Interesting and Learning place.",
          "My husband and son visited the \u201eMaritiman\u201c while my daughter and I walked the city. Both told me this museum is worth to visit but all provided information where written in Swedish! No translation in English or Other languages. That\u2018s a pity! Very interesting to go onboard on",
          "Really interesting museum and you should count to spend here at least couple hours. You can visit quite a few different boats, even one under water :). There are tours in english included in the price - just check the time in advance. Ticket price - 125 kr",
          "I went as they were repairing some of the vessels so the inside of the cargo vessel and the Tugboat were not allowed to be visited, yet all the rest were able to be entered. We started by downloading the free tour so we could listen to it as we went round the ship, yet it was",
          "Time traveling some years back and role playing in the war ship and submarine on the Maritiman is a must! You can guide yourself following the self-tour signs inside the ships, which are much bigger than they seem to be. Get to know the inside of war ships (and more) including",
          "The 19 vessels claim is kind of inaccurate. The only large vessel is actually the war ship (can't really remember the name), and the rest that are made available for visitors' access are actually the small ships, and I am pretty sure I can count all the ships I got on to",
          "This was a fantastic experience, they had several ships to explore, both civilian and military as well as a u-boat. There were some narrow pathways, but it was still quite easy to get around with arrows to show which way to go. I would definitely recommend a visit!",
          "We kept our feet on land during our visit, spending plenty of time reading up on the various displays and learning about the local maritime history. Particularly liked the giant ship's wheel and diving equipment, and the long old black wooden boat for something different. Can",
          "Very informative, great museum to understand and experience life on a variety of ships Highly recommended, also with kids (age 10)",
          "This museum includes a collection of Swedish boats from the 1860s through the 1970s. Oldest vessel in the collection is a monitor warship, and you learn that a Swedish company built the USS Monitor. Other vessels range in size from small harbor-going boats up to a Cold War-era",
          "We stumbled across this attraction as we walked around the harbour. We decided that it might be worth a visit and were not disappointed. It was great fun being able to explore the maze like decks of the warship without too much interference. This allowed you to get a feel of",
          "Take 2 hours to visit this place which explains about various ships in this port town. The walk is very interesting has lot's of details. I think children will enjoy it very much",
          "Lots of boats to visit, lots of things to see ! My father who is 81 was able to get around this site without problems ! But he didn't go into the sub as we were told this is small area and not a great place if you are carrying a few extra pounds ! But all the other boats were",
          "Plenty to do here. We spent 3 hours or so looking around the various boats here. The warship and submarine are interesting to have a look around with many of the areas open... engine room, bridge, mess deck, magazine/shell storage area, funnel and outer decks. Would recommend",
          "This museum was quite interesting as you walk through about 4-5 ships from different eras. The submarine was really cool and puts into perspective the tightness of the quarters. We took the english tour (free with admission) and the guide was knowledgeable, witty and funny.",
          "Visited here plenty of times and I've so far never been disappointed. It's a great place to bring your family, kids usually love this place (even more than your biggest boat lover). Its very interactive and you get to go on all the different kinds of boats (submarines, warships,",
          "you will have a good view of the sea side along with other surrounding place. Better to visit during afternoon till evening.",
          "I just stumbled upon this as I was walking along the side of the river. A neat little open air museum at the harbour. Didn't go onto any of the boats as I hadn't intended on visiting but I stopped and read the information (which was also in English) besides the exhibits that",
          "Be prepared for lots of climbing ladders when you visit this museum. The exhibits are all real ships and have lots of ladders between the decks. When we visited some of the smaller ships were not there but there was enough to see. It took 3 hours to look at what was on offer and",
          "Had this one in my sights for a while and the opportunity came up, there's a few smaller vessels which you get a more orless full run of,but the set pieces are the submarine and destroyer. The sub as a coastal patrol boat not very large but still afloat and with full access all",
          "They have a Monitor. The S\u00f6lve, built in 1875 and on the same lines as the Ironclads Monitor and the CSS Virginia. These ships changed the face of naval warfare in the American Civil War. Stepping aboard you are aware of the shallow draft. It is dark and cramped. It moves with",
          "Even if you're not into destroyers and submarines, you can't fail to be captivated by this museum experience on Gothenburg's harbour front. You can explore the destroyer Sm\u00e4land, the old lightship Fladen (pre-dating the modern lighthouse!) and, scariest of all, the submarine",
          "It was a grey and overcast day, so what better than to spend it 'indoors' exploring engine rooms and submarines! The variety of vessels your pass gives you access to is, I think, unrivalled - I've been in similar places in San Francisco, London and Perth, but this is better! I",
          "The museum is very interesting in that all the exhibits are real floating ships and a submarine. Guided pathways lead you around, and you need to be fairly fit to go up and down all of the ladders,and steep stairs. Don't go in the submarine if you are claustrophobic, but if you",
          "We went to the Maritiman boat museum not expecting much, but we were both amazed. Floating in the harbour were about 10 to 20 boats and a submarine that you could walk round and in. They had red arrows painted on the floor and walls of the ships so you could not get lost. It",
          "Great place to explore a floating museum. Access was free using the 'Goteburg City Card' and was well worth the experience. The museum is a collection of vessels linked together on the water. You get to wander around each vessel checking out every nook and cranny and it's an",
          "A real gem of the Swedish Army. You may need about 3 hours to visit all the ships and also a submarine. They also offer a lot of activities for children and a guidad tour in English.",
          "I was looking forward to visit G\u00f6teborg floating maritime museum and I wasn't disappointed. While I 'm more interested on military vessels, the current collection shows a great balance between the sexier naval vessels and the civilian ships which keep the city's marine history",
          "Some of the maritime museums we have been too are all exhibition based with perhaps the odd ship to explore, this however, seemed to be differed with such a large collection of ships to explore from cargo vessels, a warship and a submarine. Overall it was a good few hours well",
          "A unique experience to explore such a variety of ships on the water. We started with a free guided tour, which was a great introduction to the most popular boats, and then explored the ships in detail. The marked routes and decent English explanations helped get the most from",
          "You need around 2-3 hours here. They do an English speaking tour at certain times that really covers there main ship the HMS Smaland a destroyer. You can climb all over the ship and lots of the descriptions are written in Swedish and English. You can also visit the submarine",
          "Go on the boats and explore. Do not bring a backpack as you will be climbing up a ladder through a narrow hatch on the submarine. You must be in reasonable shape for the sub and the destroyer, lots of climbing in narrow passageways. Displays have English.",
          "The museum consists of about 7 ships moored together, including a naval destroyer, submarine and cargo ship. They are all from different eras too so it is a history lesson as well as an exploration. There is not a set route to follow around the ships but the no entry zones are",
          "This museum offers for visit 7-8 ships from the swedish navy army. The visit also includes a submarine, which is pretty rare on the maritime museum usually. They also offer nice activities for kids, where they can learn a lot of things. This museum could be a good lesson for",
          "There are 4 ships and a submarine moored in the center of Goteborg. All of them can be visited and for children it will be a very good time. For adults can be either a good experience or a very boring one. If you go as a family the price is quite decent.",
          "This is a gem. Ships to visit and even a submarine. The destroyer ship involved climbing up and down steep narrow ladders, even able to go down to the engine room. I am claustrophobic but managed to get round. Mind out for ropes and other hazards but all part of the charm.",
          "This is a fun museum - plenty of things to read if you want details, but plenty of exploring if you'd rather just climb up and down ships and burn off energy (yours or someone else's). Our older son was disappointed that when we visited the Freighter was closed off due to new",
          "You don't need a boat interest. Or a marine one for that matter. Enjoying this museum is easy, even in the pouring rain (yes, it's half outdoor, on water). I f you can say yes to this question you should definately go: Would you like to be inside a submarine from the 60s and see",
          "Some you can wander about. Others you can view from the shore or from another boat. There could be a lot of climbing and/or ladders to deal with to see everything. There is a reduced rate for seniors and lots of fun things for kids to do. We had the guided tour which was not",
          "Very impressed with all the armament on Destroyer Smaland. Grateful for English language descriptions of weapons. Submarine is challenging to get into and out of with vertical ladder, but worth it.",
          "Visited as part of the City Card and included a 30 minute English speaking guided tour. Well documented throughout - just follow the red arrows through the destroyer. The submarine is also a great experience. The site, just a short walk north from the city centre, has numerous",
          "This is one of several awesome attractions in Gothenburg!! This place has many fabulous ships that you can climb in and out of and up and down - we went into a submarine (watch your head!!) and ALL OVER a destroyer boat - really fabulous!",
          "If you want to go into the entrails of a destroyer and sub.. come and visit its great...you have to climb a lot..",
          "You get to walk through a variety of old ships. Both my 24-year-old and 22-year-old enjoyed it. The thrill was going down into the submarine.",
          "You'll see many different types of ships there; some are tricky to find the access to and others are just not open for visitors. Bur my highlight is the submarine!! Don't take any backpacks or bulky stuff with you = it's tight in there! Ergo: for 120 SEK it's absolutely worth",
          "Enjoyed all the different kind of ships you can visit. The \"Smaland\" is impressive and you can see everything, inside and outside. The submarine is also great, not in size to go in but you get a good feeling how it is to live that way. The access ticket is valid for a year, so",
          "Lots of hatches, steep staircases and ladders to climb on. Absolute freedom to explore most vessels at one's own pace. Not everything is open for the public, but a lot of unexpected spaces are possible to visit. The submarine is the main attraction, though several other vessels",
          "Interesting for mobile grand parents and kids who are curious. Very difficult to get to some parts with ladders through holes etc. Years have left patina all over the place and that is what you are there to see. Old boats and what they look like today.",
          "Just the submarine shoul give value for the money. But also the destroyer will bring you in a fantastic travel. Smaller ships are also fascinating. Don't miss the guided tour (free)!",
          "I visited a Maritiman during rainy cold Sunday and even to the condition exhibition was quite crowded. Access from the central station isn\u00b4t far (7-10 min walk). Staff speaks English and small restaurant/shop is useful after visiting all of the boats. If you are planning to",
          "Maritiman consists of several ships moored off the waterfront in Gothenburg. Several of them are open to visitors to explore at their own pace, or to see the highlights with a guide. Guided tours alternated between English and Swedish. A couple of the smaller ships could only",
          "Our 5-year-old grandson thought Maritiman was fabulous, along with his dad & granddad. Ships & boats, and even submarine, to climb aboard.",
          "This is an excellent museum of many ships, destroyer and submarine and many commercial ships. Private parties can be arranged.",
          "We often come here with our family and our children just loves it. They can walk around and experience new thing all day along. For adults, there is som much nice history in the museum. Well arranged and really nice staff!",
          "My daughter in law grandchildren and I greatly enjoyed looking over the ships and submarines. It was fun to see where the sailors ate, slept and worked whilst at sea. The submarine was particularly interesting and seeing all the missiles stored below decks. There are",
          "if you are in the city you should pass by to check the boat and the view around it.. also it is a very nice option to stay there for a coffee :)",
          "It is excellent. A war ship with a submarine and adjoining ships. Extremely well maintained. Fully worth the entry fee.",
          "This open air maritime museum is a must do when in Gothenburg. The tickets are relatively cheap - around \u00a312-\u00a314 - and the attraction is absolutely breathtaking, as you get to explore different kind of ships and vessels and even get on a submarine. The museum offers guided tours",
          "Didn't expect this to be so good. The children loved going into all the holes of all the boats, especially loving the destroyer and submarine.",
          "This place is really a nice surprise. It's possible to go in a war ship, 2 submarines and some other nice historical ships/boats. This is a nice way to know more about this kind of stuff. Place is close to the city center and the skanska building.",
          "This is the second time I visit this museum, and I am not less disappointed. You should allow yourself about 2h, or even more, if you have children, to explore all the boats (7 or 8). Captions and some explanations in English. Prepare to walk and climb a lot (on steepy narrow",
          "Maritiman is one of my favorite attractions in G\u00f6teborg. You get to climb on-board a destroyer, a submarine, a freighter, a monitor and a lighthouse boat. Plenty of staircases and ladder make it a fun exploration. The explanations on the submarine have been recently updated,",
          "Excellent museum comprising a number of moored boats/ships. A refreshing lack of barriers/areas you can't go, means that you really feel you are exploring the boats properly, not just going on a tour.",
          "This floating museum requires a lot of time if you want to see it all, and it's good to go on a good day without rain, as it's a lot of walking outside. Quite hard to get the story of the ships, and it helps a lot to read up on before hand. Did not try the audio tour. You can",
          "We visited this open air museum on a terribly raining day, but still was a good experience. We crossed more than once the innumerable rooms on the big navy ship (destroyer \"Smaland\") and couldn't believe how little room there was on the submarine. Unlike many other museums, here",
          "Great to go around on ships and an old sub. Lots of up and down climbing and tight quarters. Not recommended for people with problems walking.",
          "Even if you don't like museums this is one to visit...it is very funny to go from one boat to another and see who sailors lived on them. It is fun not only for kids but also grownups!",
          "Really interesting if you like ships. The destroyer tour was comprehesnive and well signed. The submarine was more interesting and very cramped!",
          "After visiting Goteborg I finally visited Maritiman. What a fantastic place! Exploring the boats is great fun for kids old and young. The submarine has quite limited access for less mobile, but if you can make it down the vertical ladder then it is most definitely worth it.",
          "Excellent place to visit, for anyone with even the slightest interest in ships, warfare or the living conditions of the crews. You get almost unlimited access to most areas of the ships, so leave yourself enough time to get around all the ships, but in particular the destroyer",
          "This is a very interesting outdoor museum, some 12 ships are on \"display. You can walk around, even you can get on and in. Worth to visit.",
          "Maritiman is a great place to visit well in Goteborg ,i went there last year and again this year as it is so interesting , if you take there cruise you get to go to the Volvo museum as well and it is an easy way to get there to , the ships and boats at are at Maritiman are very",
          "Hands on experience. climb all over the boats, smell the salt in the air. If you dare, climb into tha narrow submarine.",
          "I debated about coming here, as I am not at all a nautical person. To my surprise, I actually spent a couple of hours here and found it fascinating seeing the insides of a naval destroyer, a submarine, and other types of ships.",
          "Several boats/ships from many marks on the timeline, civil and military ships berthed in one spot, kept original and untouched, for you to board and enjoy. Do not miss the keypoint! The Submarine, docked next to the huge destroyer! Prices? Very acceptable. \"On the dollar\"!",
          "We visited here today and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is due to the advertised tour only being in swedish but with the information boards you don't really miss out and some bits of the 'follow this arrow' pathway being rubbed off. The",
          "My guidebook claimed it was the best museum of this type in Europe, but I'd rather oppose this view. The submarine was great, I mean really cool and it was an authentic Swedish submarine. The other warship was ok, but it lacked a visiting route and I got lost a couple of times.",
          "This is a museum consisting of old war ships on water. You can go inside each of them and explore all you want. A lot to see and learn. Our teen son loved it, especially the submarine. But our daughter thought it was just ok. Beware: there's a lot of climbing up and down narrow",
          "Not too impressed myself and i dont think my 4 year old son envoy\u00e9s the place either. The submarine was good but then it was ok but not as i expected.",
          "They sell you a season's pass for about 100 kr that allows you to go to this place any time you want during the season. The submarine and the destroyer are amazing. The rest of the ships are worth watching as well. Make sure that you have enough time as it won't take you less",
          "We were in Gothenberg 2 days after the Maritiman visiting season was over so were not able to enter the boats, but we're able to take plenty of pictures from the pier. There was still a lot to see along the pier.",
          "The remains of the once so proud Royal Swedish Naval fleet have ended up here. It\u00b4s an interesting place if you are in for naval ships from the past. It\u00b4s worth a few hours though if you like to stroll around and up and down steep ladders.",
          "Truly unforgettable experience. Various ships can be visited, but a submarine wins it all. Veterans who served aboard similar submarines are guides in there, which is a great opportunity to get some first-hand information.",
          "A good selection of ships and a submarine. Enough for about 2 hours. Having said that, as one would expect, the inside of these can be a little cramped so getting around is a little difficult.",
          "All ships are floating, so prepare to be gently rocked by the river. The main attractions must be the Destroyer Smaland and the sub Nordkaparn. Smaland will take its time to search through. More or less all of the ship is accessible and there are red arrows on the floor pointing",
          "There is a lot to see at this attraction from the war ships to the submarines. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to this museum. It is a lot larger on the inside than it appears on the outside and involves climbing up and down numerous ladders. We personally spent over one hour on",
          "This is an outdoor museum of 17 different ships (including a u-boat), although it seems like you cannot visit all of them. I found that the museum lacked in information and the little information that they had (like a video about the museum) was in Swedish. Obviously children",
          "This is described as the largest, floating exhibition of ships in the world. Not sure if that is true but I can say it is a couple of hours really well spent. I was actually on business and had a couple of hours to spare. Maritiman was approx 15 minutes stroll from my city",
          "We missed the opportunity to visit the Museum indoor part, but we enjoyed the possibility to explore museum' objects exhibited outdoor: boats, anchors, mar\u00edtime vehicles etc. Everything is tagged with english descriptions and in a perfect working condition. Don't miss the paddan",
          "As a Harbour City with a shipbuilding history Gothenburg needs of course a Museum to do with ships. Here you have the possibility to go on to several real ships of different kinds and see close up how it looks inside, how the seamen lived and worked. A great place for kids and",
          "Honestly nothing special, boring and costly . The vessel are nothing special not any history , I recommend the Naval museum instead , where you can see the history have experience with ship simulator .",
          "Loved this museum - loads of boats to wander round and even a submarine you can explore. Plenty of info, a reasonable price and a decent caf\u00e9 too.",
          "Different types of old ships, very interesting to walk through a submarine for example and an old military ship plus several other types of old ships (10 all together).",
          "The destroyer alone took 2 hours for my son to go through (that was with me rushing him towards the end!). The others were a quicker run through, including a submarine. Several boats were inaccessible during our visit (unsure why). Very good value for your money here! There",
          "Very interesting musuem. You get a chance to go through decomissioned warship and a submarine. Need atleast 1-2 hrs to thoroughly go thru all the ships on display.",
          "Lightship to cargo to monitor to submarine to full rigged war-buster - they are all there, side by side, just to board and explore. Climb the narrow deep cylinder into Nordkaparen, take a look at the water canons on firefighter Flodsprutan II, go through all the top",
          "Spent a few hours there this afternoon, was worth the 75 krone entrance fee (for students). There are lots of different boats which are moored to the harbour and you can explore each of them at your own pace. There is a large warship which is by far the most interesting one,",
          "The museum is easy to find on the waterfront. There are several different boats for you to explore. A new addition to the collection of lightship, coastal steamer, last remaining monitor and HMS Sealand, is a u boat. When we visited ( Easter 2014) it wasn't available to visit",
          "10 Mins walk from central station you find dozens of ships which are on display at the harbour area right by the Opera House. This collection is to showcase the maritime history of Goteburg. There are walk on ships and cafe's nearby. Plenty to be occupied with.",
          "This is my favourite spot in G\u00f6teborg. There are several ships, smaller and larger that can be explored. You can see all the small cabins and corridors where the sailors spent their lives. Be prepared to climb ladders. The big war ship and the U-boat are the most important by",
          "Only a short stroll away from the central district of Gothenburg you'll find these ships anchored. A good selection, warship, submarine, patrol boat etc to clamber over. Very informative and interesting. I have visited twice now whilst here and it's well worth the effort. Not",
          "Maritiman is a nice floating museum made up of a few warships (destroyer, submarine, patrol boat), as well as a few civilian ships (old lighthouse ship, barge, etc). Be prepared to climb up and down steep and narrow ladders, especially on the destroyer and to get in/out of the",
          "coasters , distroyers cargo vessels and submarines ; they all can be explored . Free entrance with Gothenburg card",
          "This has to be one of the most fun attractions in the city. Niether my girlfriend nor I are particular boat or military fanatics but you dont have to be to appreciate the cool factor of roaming around an intact battleship and submarine, among others. There is a guided tour",
          "We went there as my husband is very much into all things military, so of course he loved it, but I really enjoyed it too! You don't just look at the boats, you actually get to go inside and explore them on your own, taking as much time as you want. The submarine was particularly",
          "Lots of climbing up and down - real boat ladders --- GO BACKWARDS!!! But the reward is the engine rooms with all of the Diesel engines, etc. great in person look at all kinds of ships. Boat lovers will be in heaven!!",
          "If you are interested in ships and espacially warships, you are in the right place. See a submarine and other specials from outside and inside.",
          "Excellent museum. Spent several hours there. Being able to go into the ships gives a good insight into what travelling on them must have been like.there are a lot of narrow steep steps .really enjoyed the submarine. Best attraction in Gothenborg city",
          "We really enjoyed that 2 hours. You can enter to almost all rooms on a warship and a submarine, you can touch everything and it also gives a good view to the city.",
          "An outstanding adventure for individuals and families interested in climbing over many older military vessels. Knowledgeable and obviously experienced Staff to answer questions and give guidance. Might be ideal for children. Might remind somebody about adventure books they",
          "Nice to see the city from a oat. But if there is not enough customers, they do no give the service. Courteous guide and worth doing it... If you are lucky to have enough people. I waited for 45 minutes",
          "A couple friends I recently made stopping in my hostel invited me along on there planned trip to the above attraction... not being a particulaly big fan of boats i was a little reluctant in joining them but it did seem a good way of killing an afternoon rather than sitting in my",
          "If u wanna know more about the maritime acitivites , this is must see, for people less interested in sea it would be pretty boring ...",
          "My son and I had a great couple of hours exploring the destroyer and submarine (and other ships). Be warned though, parts may not appeal to those who don't like close confines. We also managed to find ourselves going the wrong way along the marked out route - we have noticed",
          "It's not everyday you can see inside old submarine, and see how tiny & low the spaces there. Good to entertain kids & \"big\" kid like my husband as well^_^ but it just not for me.",
          "They have left the destroyer and the submarine pretty much untouched since decommissioning. Lots of steep ladders and small bulkheads to get through. You can do way down into the engine room and magazines as well as up to the bridge in the destroyer. Not for someone with",
          "The museum has many different ships, each with a different history and purpose. It was very fun climbing up and down the different levels of the destroyer, Sm\u00e5land, and seeing the different rooms and artillery. There are also fireboats,lightboats, moniters and many other ships.",
          "This museum is situated down at the city harbour - close to the Operahouse (G\u00f6teborgsOperan) - and here you can take a closer look at submarines, warships and more.",
          "Go inside a destroyer and a submarine. That alone was enough to attract us! You can do a guided tour or do it on your own. We did it on our own between tours. Some of the spaces are small and hard to maneuver so do not try to take someone in ill health.",
          "I never thought that I would be interested in a warship but, in the end, it was so fascinating walking around it, that I only left because it was closing time. Both the submarine and the big ship give an amazingly evocative experience - you can easily put yourself in the shoes",
          "It was interesting to explore a Swedish navy ship and submarine. I gained a real sense of what it was like to live and work on these ships.",
          "this nice museum gives you a good overview of the past maritime of the great city of Goteborg.",
          "This is cool museum not only for kids but for adults as well. Lots to see and learn and experience the inside of beautiful ships and a submarine.",
          "Great how the ships are connected and you can wonder around between them. The highlight is the submarine and of course the destroyer.",
          "Nice warships and submarines, allow 1,5hrs to see everything",
          "We decided to visit here as it was a foul rainy day and figured if anything is waterproof, its a ship. We spent the majority of our time on the Destroyer and the Submarine. With the exception of some areas cordoned off one is given free reign to clamber about the ships - a",
          "Part of ships mentioned in a guide and shown on a map just aren't there.",
          "20 ships of different types and sizes, access all areas. Includes a submarine which I must admit I found very interesting if not a little scary inside, would not like to be in one of these under the sea. You can easily spend a few hours here and is good for kids and adults"

Pick a place on the rocks, sit down, eat your ice cream and enjoy the wonderful view!! Worth staying until the sun sets!!",
          "Lovely church with wooden roof inside resembling an up turned viking ship. Outside there are lovely scenic views of Gothenburg so excellent for photo's both inside the church and out.",

          "Visited this church as part of a cruise ship excursion. Nice view of the city. The ceiling is built with logs.",
          "From this elevated spot youll find one of the greatest, nearly 360 degrees, views over Gothenburg. The Masthuggskyrkan looks as if it grows up out of the rock. Designed in Swedish national romantic style, its aim is to reflect both the shipping culture (important part of the",
          "This place was very nice, met my nan here, which is very surprising since she died 5 years ago. I do not believe in God but all the stories were very interesting, good fiction writer",
          "Went to Masthuggskyrkan on a cold winter afternoon. The church was closed, therefore we were not able to see inside. There is parking in the area at the back of the church. It\u2019s an ordinary church with good location.",
          "The 60m high tower is one of Gothenburg's most famous landmarks.Inspiration has been taken from ancient culture, especially in the interior",
          "The views of the city were not as impressive as I was expecting them to be and the church has somewhat limited hours and it is hard to know if you are able to enter and if so, where you should enter. The church is very beautiful from the outside and the inside is just as",
          "Scandinavian churches are (forgive me) rarely standouts - and if you come all the way here just to visit the building... Well, it would be a rating of 2 for me. Location overseeing the city is another matter entirely and is worth consideration.",
          "Very large brick built church set very high with views over Gothenburg. A must do if you visit the city.",
          "We visited this church as part of a coach tour from our cruise so our time here was a bit limited. It is a nice church with some beautiful decoration and also an interesting mobile near the altar. I am not sure whether I would go out of my way to visit this church.",
          "Started in 1914, the church is located on a high hill which gives commanding views of Goteborg, especially Goteborg harbor. The church itself has an interior reminiscent of a Viking Stave church, with a beautifully timbered ceiling, and timbers which exhibit the work of skilled",
          "We visited this church while on a Coach Tour. Situated atop a hill there are great views of the city and the harbour, especially on a clear day. The Church is lovely inside with a decorative altar and a beautiful tapestry on the wall. Also seen from the church surrounds is",
          "We used the tram to get up here and the views are good. Unfortunately the tower tours are twice a day and I missed that.",
          "This church was included on our coach tour of Gothenberg. The high location makes it a visible landmark from most parts of the city. We were fortunate to be driven to the location rather than having to walk up streets to the church. The high location does provide excellent views",
          "There are many paintings on the walls. As it turned out, these are the exhibitions of local artists who are pre-recorded to show their works. I have never seen anything like this. There is a small separate room where you can put a stone with all your sorrows and misfortunes and",

          "Built in 1914 and standing at 60m high, this USA great spot to sit and soak in the sun while visiting tourist spots, seeing the fireworks on New Year's Eve or just a great view of the city. You can see G\u00f6ta Alv and Mich more fr.o.m. Up there.",
          "Most people going up the winding streets to this large church, doesn't enter it, but stay outside to watch the view of the city. On evenings in the summer and especially weekends, it's common to find students and other younger people partying and drinking here.",
          "Not very easy to get there, on top of the hill, it will take you a while to walk up to it. Ill give you a hint. From the centre go see Oscar Fredriks Church first, then cut across through the back yard to Fjalgatan and follow the road to this church. The church doesnt offer much",
          "A church with an impressive story ( rumor has it the tower was filled with dynamites during the second world war, if the enemies would have come close enough the tower would have been blowed up) Takes some effort to walk up but easy to jump on the bus nr 60",
          "Good solid church on the hill typical of the time. Not elaborate like European construction. Not a good wet day walk tho.",

          "It is the church that you can see from the shores of the river almost from everywhere in the city. The church..don't really worth a visit, but the views of the city and of the river valley are fabulous",
          "The view from Masthuggskyrkan is very nice, but the church itself isn't worth visiting really. It's a nice enough church but nothing special.",
          "The church is placed in a really nice viewpoint to all Gothenburg. Is is a historical monument well preserved. I really liked the exterior of the church (there are wooden doors in stone walls that give the place a medieval look). Interior is quiet, clean decorated and perfect",
          "A nice place to see a beatiful view of goteborg! The church has a old decoration and we can feel the christianity getting power through the ages! You should visit and take some pictures of the view! It's awesome!",
          "This was a photo stop on a guided tour, right after we had arrived in Goteborg from Denmark via ferry. Unfortunately, it was a cloudy and foggy day, but enough of the fog had lifted to let us know the sights from here on a clear day would be spectacular. They were very good",
          "The church itself is architecturally very interesting and was designed by Sigfrid Ericson in the National Romantic style, and the builder was Ivar Burman. Kyran was built in 1911 and was inaugurated in 1914. Masthuggskyrkan is one of the most important landmarks in Gothenburg.",
          "Loved the wood interior of this lovely church. We met the priest and he was charming and very informative. The inside is not to be missed with hidden gems throughout.",

          "This church was built in the early 1900s but in a style to look back at old handicraft. Excellent woodwork. Dragonheads in the lamps. Stonewall where every stone was hand-picked. One of the greatest places to get a beautiful view in town. You see all the way to the ocean. In",
          "Whilst buying some gloves, the sales assistant suggested we visited here and even showed us on the map which team to get and where to get off. We were very glad we did! The view from the top is spectacular and well-worth the climb.",
          "This church is a good place to visit when in goteborg. The best thing is it on the top of a hill accessible by taxi with great views. The road to the top is also a scenic route. Also it is good place to check out the history and old Swedish architecture.",
          "Here you can see Gothenburg from the mainland with a nice view over the harbour. This church was built 1914",
          "Great view of the harbour and the city from this Church. Decoration inside inspired by the many seamen of Gothenburg. Nice, peaceful room for contemplation also.",
          "It is a protestant church, so it is not the most beautiful or ornate church, but it's location at the top of a hill is it's big strength. There are some nice natural spaces (trees, grass, rocks) at the top of the hill so I decided to sit on a rock and eat my lunch while looking",
          "A must when you visit Gothenburg. There's still animal fur living the main doors, and thre candles for devotion area at the back is really beautiful. If ther is a choral conch on during your stay, make sure to attend: the acoustics are amazing",
          "The view is nice, specially if it is a sunny day! But the church itself, makes it completely worth to come here.",
          "I had the pleasure of receiving a tour of this beautiful church by friend that works there and it is fantastic. It has a dark and thoughtful atmosphere , it Ina's a simple yet commanding presence .",
          "You can go to Masthugskyrkan by bus or tram combined with a short walk. The view to Gothenburg is great and the church is worth a visit although it is not a particularly old church. The story goes that dynamite was placed in the vaults of the church during world war one so it",
          "Take a walk to the Masthuggskyrkan with your friends and a kilo of fresh shrimps as a start for the next adventure.",
          "It's a 400m walk up to the church from the bus stop. This is the easier route compared to the path at the back of the church which is quite steep. A pretty good view of Goteborg from behind the church. Was there on a Sunday, a service was going on in the chapel. There's some",
          "Went on the Botanical Visit from our cruise. However, it was the National Holiday and some 8 or 10 buses were parked and people were swarming around trying to get in. Unfortunately the building was locked. The church has a great vantage point looking over the river an industrial",
          "A beautiful nordic church with surroundings that offer a vantage point to see the whole of Gothenburg and the surrounding waterways and harbour. Well worth a visit.",
          "Masthuggskyrkyan affords possibly the best vantage point in Gothenburg with its magnificent view of the city and waterways from each direction. When we visited there was some restoration being done outside but it was not intrusive. Do not miss the interior of this hundred year",
          "This is a spot if you wish to see Gothenburg from the top. Amazing view and an easy climb and easy access. Bring a portable BBQ and enjoy the sunset.",
          "There was some restoration work in progress when we visited. A pretty nice church. Dont compare with Rome. The location and the architecture both blend well. The church literally overlooks the city. From around the church you have a good view of the city of g\u00f8teborg in all",
          "Great view and best on a clear and sunny day. Mind you, there isn't anything \"to do\" on the site itself other than enjoy the view - so don't expect multiple coffee shops, or being able to buy a sandwhich anywhere if you're hungry. Other than that, it is a great place to sit and",
          "The church was built 1914 and is an interesting reminder that Gothenburg is a city by the sea. Even more spectacular than the church is the beautiful view over the western part of the city, and even the islands in the southern archipelago, from the church.",
          "From here you can see the hole Gothenburg in all directions! In New Year is here a lot of fireworks and in summer beautiful sunsets ...",
          "This is a church that is about 100 years old, located on the top of a hill. Several of the city trams have sops near the church, but there's a significant walk up the hill from any of the stops. Inside of the church, there's a self-guided tour - for a small fee, you can get a",
          "Herefrom you get a good view over Gothenburg, from the sea along the river Gota Alv, towards the central parts of the city. In summertime it is a popular picnic spot. The church itself reflects the scandinavian history.",
          "The church was designed by Sigfrid Ericson and built in 1914. The church represents the national romantic style in Nordic architecture. It is located on the Masthugget hill. Outside the church there is a spectacular view of G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv, \u00c4lvsborgsbron and the surroundings.",
          "It was too late to go inside of the church,but the look from the top of this hill took my breath away! Too bad it was windy so we couldn't stay more longer :)",
          "A very old church with fascinating architecture (if you cannot see it - look harder) and the great smell of wood. Interesting carvings a lovely idea of hanging little figurines in an alcove for each child christened at the church. There is parking available around the building",
          "Ok, the actual church isn't spectacular but the view from the surrounds is well worth the climb! You can also get there by car.",
          "This is without doubt my favorite church in Gothenburg. There is definitely something special about its location, architecture and atmosphere. I recommend this as the first stop for first-time visitors to the city. Built at the top of a hill, you have a great view to the West",
          "We walked from town to this church, many do bus tours. It is a 40 minute walk and worth a visit. This church was built in 1914, it was designed to resemble what a Viking age church would have looked like. So many beautiful things to see inside, especially touching the tree of",

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb.

A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements.

Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies.

Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad.

The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet.

Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre.

It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\".

The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

The simulator on one of the finest 90's fighter aircrafts was amazing, worth shedding few bucks but believe me do not take it less than 30 min or deal for more. Staff is quite cooperative and amazingly nice.",

          "The visit is self-guided and that doesn\u00b4t make it very exciting. You can get inside many of the aircrafts and that is the best, but if you are travelling alone (like me), its hard to capture great memories in them, like this. The museum is very far away from the main city center",
          "This place is interesting area where you can walk and spend hour after hour. I love to visit this place over and over again. This is the only museum in Sweden made to withstand an atomic bomb!",

          "The whole atmosphere of underground bunker and scale of the place and amount of stuff to see was suprising. Clearly bit more oriented to the families with kids but got a lot of out of it as an single adult also. Worth visit if you want to see something quite unique.",
          "If you're interested in aviation, either military or civilian, you'll most likely have a great time at the Aeroseum. They have a great number of decommissioned planes and helicopters, some of which you get to climb aboard and experience first hand. The museum is located in an",
          "My husband and I spent a great day here with my son, his wife and our two grandchildren. It was of special interest to my husband as he loves old planes. The nice part about this museum is people are encouraged to sit inside the exhibits, which the children loved. Set",
          "We squeezed this into the end of our day travelling by tram and then bus. It wasn't easy to find on foot (look for the aeroplane by the road then go down the side road until you see signs). It was a unique experience (being underground) and our kids loved climbing into the",
          "This is a must when in Gothenburg. This a unique museum of old planes and helicopters from a time when sweden had their own production of jetplanes. Saab made the famous Draken plane and others and this Hide away made it possible to hide planes from the enemies. You go below",

          "Set in an underground hangar built for the Swedish Air Force, this is an unusual museum with a good selection of Swedish aircraft. As well as the aircraft, there are flight simulators using aircraft cockpits, interesting displays relating to the cold war, and a selection of",
          "This museum is excellent, being in a old cold war aircraft shelter build into a side of a hill, with all the famous saab aircrafts on show. Excellent staff with Peter being the best trainer in aircraft simulators and just a very nice person",

          "I had no interest in coming to this museum but my friend really wanted to go as he is interested in aeroplanes and WW2 and Cold War history. Glad we did as it was a pleasant surprise. It's a bit out of the way if you are taking the bus but once you get there you enter the bunker",
          "This review was written by my son - age 10 these are his thoughts :) You have to give your self at least one and a half hours.At the start there are some planes with facts about them and there are some small rooms with facts on world wars and other military things. Then you go",
          "This is well worth a visit for young children, seeing some of the old aeroplanes from the past. Try the flight simulators, but dress warm as the museum is underground.",
          "Went expecting to kill an hour or two, spent 5 hours seeing and experiencing everything. I'm really into both WW2 and Cold War history and prior to my visit in Gothenburg was oblivious about the presence of such a location. I would advise to anyone, it's easy enough to get to",
          "I didn't know much about this place before going here other than it was some kind of aviation museum. It's a bit outside the city but easy to reach by bus, only 20 mins bus ride from the tram stop at Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen. The exhibition focuses on the Cold War as the",

          "On walking down to the entrance of this attraction I was greeted by one of the plane mechanics, who couldn't have been a nicer guy. Then you step inside to this amazing Cold War-era bunker and can lose the hours looking through the old planes and historical exhibitions. Really",
          "As a great fan of air planes and military stuff, this was a big disappointment. They boast a lot about the unique setting in a former top secret underground hangar, but once inside it is like they don't care about this fact. A few rooms (2x3m) on the way down focus on the Cold",
          "Lots of aircraft from different eras, often with accompanying information and extra exhibits. As a non-Swedish speaking visitor, more information in English would have been much appreciated.",
          "Everybody who is intersted in Aviation will like this museum. It is situated in a former Bunker, has a lot of exhibits that can be dirscovered handson so to say...you can climb in and feel how it is/was to be pilot in those planes. There are facilities like a snack restaurant",

          "This place is a little rough but that adds to the character. It is located in an old underground bunker beside the Gothenburg airport. The aircraft on display are varied and in great condition. Most of them you can get close enough to touch.",
          "You'll find there a lot knowledge about history, airplanes and helicopters but also a lot things to do. The place is just amazing!",
          "Interesting underground air museum with some good pieces of history, but for children and adults, the flight simulators are brilliant. Well worth it, but they charge extra to go on them, and the entrance fee isn't cheap to start with.",
          "I'd only spotted this place while browsing the map at 500px - I didn't know it was there otherwise! Another weekend in Sweden was on the cards, so after picking up my hire car, I drove around the airport perimeter to the entrance. As I passed the gate, I saw the opening time was",

          "It is situated outside of town and as other reviewers have said it seem like you're I'm the middle of nowhere. However right where the bus drops you off there is a big jet with signs telling you where to go. It was very interesting to be able to go down into this bunker and see",
          "Several airplanes and helicopters exposed in an old arm camp underground. The own location by itself is amazing already. Besides that, you can get really close to the airplanes. The best is a jet from 1960 that you get into the cokpit as a real pilot. There are also some",
          "This museum is awesome but be very careful when going there by public transportation. Buses operate hourly and the stop is around 800m from the entrance. It really worth to visit the museum but you must plan the route in case of using public transportation.",
          "Okay so the road to the museum is underwhelming. It's a long country gravel path with cows to one side and tall grass to the other. The road isn't paved and halfway through you start to wonder \"huh... am I in the right place?\" The main entrance has a small guard house where",
          "Way out of town, is an entire Air Force Base built underground. For individuals interested in Swedish fighter aircraft, hidden military bases, and how a neutral country can defend itself. This is recommended. Like most attractions in Sweden, the interest fee is very high.",
          "I spent four hours in there looking at everything. They have flight simulators you can use as well as the cockpits open in the fighters so you can sit in a real fighter jet. I got the opportunity to meet a pilot of the plane I was sitting in so it was a very fun time hearing",

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century.

A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n.

Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies.

Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad.

The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet.

Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre.

It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\".

The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "Went just after opening and therefor it wasn\u2019t as crowded as a museum can be. The museum is amazing and very well organized. It\u2019ll take many days to fully explore it, and it\u2019s a great venue for kids! Only down side is that there\u2019s too few dinosaurs, but that\u2019s a personal",
          "This is the oldest attarction in Gothenburg, although you would hardly know it! Good exhibits from butterflies to elephants and also a dynosaur skeleton. Really interesting if you are into natural history",

          "It was a fantastic day out for the whole family. We really loved it and would definitely come again!",
          "It's a vast and really interesting museum, full of history from the natural world. So beautifully presented in a beautiful building. Definitely worth a visit for an hour or two.",
          "This museum has a great selection of creatures, especially birds and sea creatures, but also many land mammals I have not seen before. Descriptive text where applicable is interesting, and most is in English.",

          "I love this museum. It highlights how Swedish people learnt about the animals of the world before the introduction of the modern Zoo. It has the most amazing collection of dead stuffed animals like a Blue Whale and a Giant Ant eater. Its also in the middle of the city's most",
          "A lovely way to spend an afternoon. Thw museum is well organised with a large variaty of animals on display. If you enjoy these kind of museums, then this is a must for you. Not to memtion that there was no entrance fee when we visited.",
          "One place to see all animals across the world!! Big, small, wild, pets, birds.... everything. The animals are just like they were standing there and will start to make sounds now!! Life size blue whale is amazing together with African elephant!",
          "I visited one afternoon with a friend but we only had a couple of hours. Museum is a good size so make time, especially if you want to see and read everything. I unfortunately only saw part of it. The museum was good and had some interactive things such as microscopes and time",

These animals don\u2019t have rights, they\u2019re dead. Many of them actually had their story too, for example Simba was in",

          "I think this museum is fascinating although I think there are many other things to do in Gothenburg to visit that are a bit better. I will say though that this is a comprehensive museum devoted to every type of animal I have ever seen.",
          "A good museum built around the 19th/early 20th centuries obsession with stuffing animals - including the world's only stuffed blue whale. A nice place to spend a couple of hours wandering through row upon row of pretty much every animal in existence.",
          "This is a classic museeum. It houses a myriad of interesing things and if you are interested in nature, biology or animals I amd pretty sure you will love this place.",
          "If you have any interest in natural history then this is a must see attraction. If you don't then you should still go because you will have an interest after you have been. The quantity and quality of exhibits is amazing and my only complaint would be a lack of English",
          "Well worth a visit. Plus the ticket for 40krona includes entry to 4 other museums, shame we didn't know that at the beginning! It has such a great collection that took a long time to get around as there were lots of interesting facts to read.",
          "Stumbled across this museum and spent a very pleasant few hours, nice cafe with fresh sandwiches & cakes & great coffee!",
          "A huge selection of stuffed animals, particularly birds. Easy to get to with a tram stopped a couple of 100 meters away. 90 minutes is enough time to spend there. Most of the written information is in Swedish only but some parts in English",

          "An enjoyable afternoon spent here. A bit of a steep climb from the tram stop. Lots of different species of birds, insects and animals on show. An opportunity to see many species which you have only seen in picture books",
          "This is a small museum, I would say you could do the whole thing in a couple of hours, but one of the most beautiful natural history museums I've been to. The 'modern' section is just ok, nothing exciting here, but the older part of the building is amazing. Proper old style",
          "Fun place to take the kids on a rainy day in the city, loads of taxidermied animals kind of creepy but also fun.",
          "This museum has it all, if you want to know about different animals. Its very well organized. There is a cafeteria aswell.",
          "Having been to many natural history museums over the years, this one is relatively small. But that made it more manageable with small children. Animals, birds, dinosaurs and the ability to literally climb inside a whale. Overall a good few hours of inquisitive fun.",
          "Personally I find stuffed animals a bit creepy and not necessarily the best way to learn about natural history, if you are a fan of taxidermy then you will love this. The museum is vast and really well cared for. I went with my daughter (24) and we stayed for an hour and also",
          "It was quite eye opening to see so many stuffed animals in one place. The baby blue whale was mind boggling until I went upstairs to the thousands of birds (I've never seen so many or varieties) and animals around the world. I liked the African animals you come to expect",
          "If you like a museum with stuffed animals this museum is just exactly for you :) full of informative stuff about animals. The place itself is big enough and many rooms to look for. Good for children and parents as well. The stuffed Elephant and blue whale in the whale room is so",

          "Not quite worth it. Better than nothing, but... Stockholm's museum is somewhat better, but nothing compared to Vienna's. If you want to find something kid-friendly to do - you can do better.",
          "We didn't get to see much of it because we got there late and was fascinated by the section of birds they had! It was row after row about birds! And fish and other animals but we didn't have time.. it was cool though! Recommended for animal lovers who want to see every species!",
          "I like it at all! There is place for eating with children, the museum is within a very big park with zoo. It's a very interesting museum especially for children - with real elephant, Simba the lion and things like this...",

          "It is neat because most of it was done in the late 1800s to early 1900s, which gives it a Darwinian Nautralist feel. But make no mistake, it's more taxidermy than you'll likely ever see again.",
          "Obviously not as big as Natural History Museum in London or the US varients, but still has quiet an extensive collection of animals, fishes and plants. 40SEK for adults and free for youth (25 or young) and children.",
          "This museum provides its visitors with a huge variety of dead and alive animal creatures. The time we were there they had a live exhibition about snakes and spiders. Great place to visit. We spent almost one full day inside before we had to leave for our ferry going back to",
          "This museum has plenty of exhibits (mainly stuffed animals), but little explanation about them, other than a latin species name. Where there is explanation, it is often only in Swedish, which is disappointing considering the number of international visitors to Gothenburg.",
          "Very nice museum with various kind of things. From insects to big mamals and birds. Usually they have different themes. Strongly recommended.",
          "This museum founded 1927 has a unique opportunity to get a close encounter to a baby blue whale. It was stranded on the coast in late 1900:th century.",
          "As mentioned by many already - it is one of the 5 museums covered in the single annual ticket. So, if you have small kids who are interested in looking at stuffed animals & you have no other plans then you can visit this place. They do have a huge collection of all kinds of",
          "The Natural History Museum is a grand house, where you can go to see a large collection of animals in a familiar environment. The shop is full of nice stuff and there you can find fine gifts to buy. If you're hungry, you can enjoy a coffee and a cookie or some good food in the",
          "This is possibly a 2.5. It is a museum of natural and I expected to see some stuffed animals but I also expected to see more explanation to go with the exhibits. Most of the exhibits only had a name attached with no or little explanation about the exhibits. If the price",
          "Interesting to see so many animals in their natural size. Sad thing is just to much starts to become worn and it has burglary and destruction on Rhino.

          "Basically a museum of old taxidermy, the collection is extensive however very old and worn. The displays could use a lot of refreshing and cleaning",
          "The exhibits were nice but we were really hampered by the fact that most (90%) didnt have English labelling. Despite that we enjoyed walking around, looking at the whales etc",
          "I thought the Natural History Museum in Gothenburgh was well worth a visit. Especially if it's raining outside and you are looking for something to do, but also if you are interested in the history of Gothenburg. I think we got in for free with our Gothenburg City Card so if",
          "It's quite a boring place. It is not worth the efforts to get there. Of course if you're crazy about stuffed animals and birds this place is for you. The most of inscriptions are in Sweden. And as far as I can understood there is only one toilet in the building; and it's very",
          "Lots of fun and detailed exhibits on natural history, mostly animals. The human body exhibit was closed during our visit, but the rest of the museum was still interesting enough to warrant the entry price :)",
          "If your interest runs to taxidermy, then this is the place for you. Thousands of stuffed animals and birds in glass cases. Again the Swedes' ability to confuse with ambiguous information came to the fore when it came to finding our way around.",
          "this place, just like most of the other attractions of gothenburg, is very well organised. all the exhibits bring to life the true awe-effect of the animals and other living creatures. a MUST visit here is the blue whale exhibit... supposedly, this exhibit is the biggest whale",

          "This museum of natural is like the most but they also have some unique collections. A rainy day would be perfect for a visit at this museum - situated in the outskirts of Slottskogen.",
          "This museum reminds me of the one back at university in the biology department. It is mostly just stuffed animals, which grow boring after a while. Perhaps I would have felt more engaged if I could speak Swedish, but I ended up zipping round the museum instead, not learning",
          "This museum was awesome - full of different kinds of animals from all over the world (the bird section was particularly impressive), and almost all of them in great condition and displayed in interesting ways. Most of the information is in Swedish, with just occasional bits in",
          "I could never believe that such a museum could exist in a city other than a large capital of a country! Full of well-preserved specimens, it provides a number of thematic pathways (e.g. birds, reptiles, mammals etc.). We had a guided tour which allowed us to see even the labs of",

          "Had the Gothenburg Go card so went here without charge. Classis old school museum, with some modern additions. If you like animals you should love this, the whale alone is worth the trip. Not possible to do thoroughly, just have a wander. Limited english info, although looks",
          "If you have mobility issues don't even attempt a visit, especially in the winter, the slope from the tram stop is rather large. Once we dragged ourselves up the icy slope and arrived at the entrance the staff were very friendly offering us a leaflet and map in English and",

          "We visited here before going to Slottskogen park. The whale skeleton was amazing, it was as big as a small jet! There are lots of rooms with endless cases of birds, sea creatures, etc. that might be a little too much for smaller kids, but the lion, elephant, tiger and bigger"

        "wiki": "\u00c4lvsborg (also  Elfsborg Fortress) is a  large sea fortress in Riv\u00f6 fjord within  modern Gothenburg, Sweden. Situated at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta River, it protected medieval Sweden's only access to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, along with the nearby settlement known today as Gothenburg  (formerly named L\u00f6d\u00f6se, Nya L\u00f6d\u00f6se, \u00c4lvsborg and Charles IX's Gothenburg).The original Old \u00c4lvsborg Fortress (Swedish: \u00c4lvsborgs f\u00e4stning or \u00c4lvsborgs slott) was located on the mainland, on the southern shore of the estuary, above modern Klippan. Only few ruins are visible today in the vicinity of the Carnegie-pier.The old fortress was dismantled and relocated to one of the islands in the estuary, in the 17th century. This New \u00c4lvsborg Fortress (Swedish: Nya Elfsborg) is still maintained.\nIn 1643, a settlement in New Sweden, North America, was named Fort Nya Elfsborg (\"Fort New \u00c4lvsborg\"), after the Swedish fortress. This settlement was abandoned in 1655. Gothenburg was the main centre for Swedes emigrating to America, and the fortress would have been one of the last sights the emigrants saw on leaving the country.\n\n\n== Old \u00c4lvsborg Fortress ==\nIn medieval Sweden, \u00c4lvsborg was the country's only access to the North Sea. Bohusl\u00e4n, the area north of \u00c4lvsborg, was part of Norway until 1658; Halland, the region to the south, was part of Denmark until 1645. Sweden's only Atlantic settlement,  L\u00f6d\u00f6se, built about 1200, (known as \"Gothenburg 1\") was the first settlement located at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv. It was followed by New L\u00f6d\u00f6se (\"Gothenburg 2\") located near the modern town.In 1473, New L\u00f6d\u00f6se was granted substantial privileges. The Old \u00c4lvsborg Fortress was built in the 14th century, located at the Klippan area near what is now the harbour entrance of Gothenburg. After the Danes easily conquered the fortress several times, fortification works was gradually expanded. New L\u00f6d\u00f6se was burned down by Danish forces in 1521, and after it was initially rebuilt at the same spot in 1526, it was later relocated (\"Gothenburg 3\") near the \u00c4lvsborg fortress, west of the modern town.In 1563, when the Northern Seven Years' War broke out, the Swedish burned the town themselves to prevent Denmark from capturing it, and Denmark took control of  \u00c4lvsborg Fortress. The war ended with the Treaty of Stettin (1570), which obliged Sweden to pay 150,000 riksdaler to ransom the fortress of \u00c4lvsborg. To pay this extraordinarily high amount of money, Sweden heavily taxed all moveables in the country, resulting in further impoverishment of the war-torn population. Unburned towns had to pay one twelfth, peasants one tenth, burned down towns one eighteenth of their properties' value. In 1603, the adjacent town  (\"Gothenburg 4\") was again relocated to the site of the channel opposite \u00c4lvsborg Fortress.  Built by Charles IX of Sweden, it was the first town named \"G\u00f6teborg\".  The town was annihilated by Denmark in 1611, who retained possession of \u00c4lvsborg between 1612 and 1619.Today, only a few ruins of the fortress are preserved under a canopy to minimize further deterioration at 57\u00b041\u203223\u2033N 11\u00b054\u203226\u2033E.\n\nOld \u00c4lvsborg Fortress\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== New \u00c4lvsborg Fortress ==\nNew \u00c4lvsborg Fortress was built in the 17th century near the ruins of the old fortress, but on a small island where the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv river meets the sea. It protected the new town of Gothenburg, founded in 1621 by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.

          "It is a nice play, located in the middle of the canal. The visit is fast, in few hours you can go around and inside the buildings. It's very peacefull, the view is amazing and if you enter inside the buildings you can jump in the past and feel like a prisoner of that time.",
          "There's a ferry ride to the fortress which made for a relaxing start to our touring day. The fort itself is what you would expect with beautiful water views but I particularly enjoyed the tour. The guides dressed in costumes from the time period and acted out skits to explain",
          "when I saw the brochure for the boat ride and tour of Alvsborg fastning we dropped everything we planned for the day and hopped on board. The 30 min ride out to the island is guided and has some very interesting tidbits of info about Gotheburg past and present. The brochure",
          "I paid 180 SEK for a round trip ticket. Ticket is free with Goteborg city card. The boat ride is pleasant (about 30 minutes) and travels through the harbor. Although there were some 3-4 for waves, the ship cuts through them easily, so it was a pleasant and calm ride. There",
          "The entertainment was lovely, however the fortress was small. Very scenic. There was only 1 small cafe to eat at.",
          "To reach this fortress it's just a 30 min boat travel from the city. They have a small guided tour on the biat to explain the sights you are passing by. Once you step on the nya \u00e5lvsborgs f\u00e4stning and move towards the fort you are welcomed by a person dressed in attire of the",
          "It was build in the early 1800:th century to be a lock in the river. It was attacked by the danes in 1717, but stood against the heavy bombardement. You can go there in summertimes with boat from Lilla Bommen.",
          "After a 40 mins boat ride, you are greeted by a guide in costume and one other actor to tell this history of the island. Enough to see and explore for a few hours. Good to combine this with the Maratime Museum as the dock that this leave from is only a few mins walk from that",
          "I can thoroughly recommend this attraction even if you are not into castles. Approx 40 minute boat ride from the harbour Alvsborgs is located in the estuary. You will be greeted by a tour guide, dressed in historical costume who will then act out the part of an invading Dane.",
          "When we arrived after the boat trip there were met by \"the Danish king\" for a funny and interesting dramatized tour of the history. Due to the time table of the boat we did not manage to explore on our own as much as we would have liked, cause with the other things we had",
          "Really enjoyed the dramatised tour - the male actor was splendid and should do bigger scens! Maybe some activities like bows and Arrows, throw axe or something simular could keep up the interest for the younger Children that aren't that interested in spoken historytelling",
          "I would not recommend this to people who are in Gothenburg for a limited time. Although the island is enjoyable with a nice view if you turn the right way the fortress itself is not extremely impressive. Also, if you turn around the other way the view is not so nice with the",
          "Great trip for some hours. Its small so your done quick. It have a small cafe so you can get a drink and some food. There is a funny tour and in some hours its in English. When in gothenburg go visit this as its a great part of it history.",
          "This old fortress - from the 19th century - was biult to stop the Danish warlords before they got to Gothenburg - or as it was called at that time - Nya L\u00f6d\u00f6se.",
          "The trip began with a thirty minute boat ride to the fortress. Information given on the boat and the dramatic presentation at the fort were not offered in English so that did not enhance my learning experience or enjoyment. I was not told this when I purchased the ticket at",
          "Ferry ride is lovely and not too long, but check before going what time the English reenactment will be presented. We arrived on the first boat of the day and spent 2 hours, way more than enough time, exploring,beach combing, climbing, playing pirate and then lunching(nice"

          "The old building is in a courtyard of smaller buildings .All house artisan craftmen...silversmith, glass, chocolate specialist, antique shop etc.. In the main building today was a Christmas Market with approximately twenty other stall - quite a range of crafts on offer and all",
          "On a rainy day we were happy to enter the shops with outstanding handcrafts etc. So nice people and good bargins on our weddingday:O) Enjoy",
          "This building houses craftsmen like black smiths, weavers, wood turners all making traditional Swedish arts which can be purchased",
          "In the Kronhusbodarna from 1654 you will find crafts, silverware, ceramics, leather goods and much more.Worth a visit if you are in central Gothenburg.",
          "As I expected, the old brick storage building of military hardware stood strong and proud in the little gated square. The inside was shut for viewing, though. And only a few lonely shops kept it company. I took my lunch in the cafe and enjoyed the open face sandwich... What made",
          "Mainly walked to this place to see the old city hall that dates back to 1654 , known as Kronhuset it is a lovely brick building reported to be the oldest in the city Apparently used now by an Orchestra we could not see inside as it was closed , took a few pictures. The rest of",
          "There are about 6 shops to see (the glass/ceramic shop had lots of wonderful artwork). The cafe food will fill your belly but that is about it. Locate in the Kronhuset is the Gothenburg Wind Orchestra - well worth attending one of their concerts.",
          "This is an historic area of Goteborg with high-quality crafts, antiques, and gallery. There are not a lot of shops, but they are choice, especially for unique leather goods, pottery, glass, and jewelry. Things are not cheap, but are affordable and not out of line. There is",
          "Good food for a cold day. A selection of cold and warm dishes in a rustic environment that once was military in the center of G\u00f6teborg.",
          "Especially in the summer this part of G\u00f6teborg is pure enchantment. Small but consisting of one of the oldest parts of the town you can browse the little shop,have a snack or just a coffee or take a moment to breath in the lovely garden!",

          "As you may tell from other reviews, this place is just ridiculously under developed. The location is absolutely amazing, so close to the center, yet you can't find it, so neatly tucked away among the historical buildings. It has a very quaint chocolate and candy speciality",
          "We came across this almost by accident, it is a few blocks off the beaten path but it is a visual treat when you turn the corner and it comes into view. There are some artisan type shops with food, jewelry, glass and artworks that are worth the time to visit. The buildings are",
          "We were amazed to find this quiet and atmospheric old quarter of Gothenburg so close to the hustle and bustle of the traffic hub Brunnsparken. It\u2019s a complex of old military warehouses around a large pedestrian courtyard. Kids may run around safely. The major building, the",
          "Nice and quite, still not far from the main streets. Cool chocolate-shop. Looks like a good place to have lunch as well (the Kronhusbodarna that is) Try it out!",

          "We walked up to look at this ancient building, which was closed. The surrounding buildings are open and house artisans, artists, cafes and beautiful tiny shops. It seems a great pity that this oasis of peace and beauty is not trumpeted and promoted to visitors to gothenberg.",
          "This is very near our home so I pass it frequently when living in Sweden. It's very beautiful to look at as it's 'old world' style. The cobblestones can be a bit difficult to walk on ;-) but ...that's part of its charm. Several shops and a cafe are here as well as an",
          "We were walking around to explore a few paces of interest. The building is unique but I must be honest to say it wouldn't really catch my attention too much if I were to walk pass it .",
          "This little area is located just off one of the main streets in Gothenburg. It's quite pretty and has some interesting buildings from the outside. Ultimately, though, it feels like this area is wasting its potential. It was completely dead and is just a tourist trap. I didn't",
          "This is one of Gothenburg's hidden spots, close to Gustav Adolfs torg (Gustav Adolfs Square). Don't go out of your way to find Kronhusbodarna as it consists only of a small open place with a silversmith, chocolate shop and coffee shop. Nothing to write home about.",
          "I was at Gustaf Adolfs Torg and asked a couple of tourist info folks for directions to the Emigrant Museum. As I was about a block from the street before the Emigrant museum, I spied the old City Hall, which at first I mistook for an old church. It is an interesting building",
          "Because we were there on a Sunday, none of the shops were open except the chocolate shop. We ended up picking up perfect souvenirs to take home, pretty little bags of different licorice flavoured candies. There\u2019s lots of free samples to try out (the fudge was amazing), and the",
          "This is a pleasant little cobbled area which includes Gothenburg's oldest building but I was expecting a little more than was actually there. The chocolate shop is worth popping into as it has free samples but is a little expensive.",
          "Going back in time to see glass blowers, leather manufakturer, tradional candy store, pottery and a ver nice caff\u00e9 with an open fireplace.",
          "I was really looking forwards to visiting here as from the guide book description in sounded like a hive of culture and art. I admit I was a little disappointed...although out of season it was extremely quiet with the cafe empty and nobody browsing the shops (neither of which",
          "Great little area to visit and see the old City Hall. Some food places for great snacks right there. I went there for the history and to take pictures.",
          "The original city hall is surrounded by small boutiques, such as a silversmith, potter, and several clothing designers. Free to wander around the the wares are pricey. there is a nice little cafe where you can sit outside and enjoy a coffee and a small bite to eat.",
          "You can feel the history here. Very beautiful buildings just a step out of the buzzling centre. On a summer Saturday most of the shops were closed, cafeteria was open. If you happen to be nearby, visit here.",
          "The houses are the oldest ones in the city. There are little shops, and a restaurant too, but go elsewhere to eat.",
          "Built in 1642 these buildings transported you back in time to when G\u00f6teborg was a new city. We had a tremendous lunch at the incredibly cute Cafe Kronhuset which had delicious homemade lasagne, great baked goods and as if the setting wasn't quaint enough there was a piano player",
          "We ate here since, having wandered around the small selection of craft shops around the Kronhuset, it seemed like the obvious place to eat. I had a cheese baguette (35nok), my wife had a baked potato + tuna (79nok). Sandwich filling was pretty stingy. We went in summer time, so",
          "Just behind the very important East Indian Museum (G\u00f6teborgs city Museum) is some of the oldest buildings in town. This is the coffee shop in the complex. Romantic, but still just a simple coffee shop. Very close to that is a specialist store selling chocolate. Recommended!",
          "The Kronhus and the Kronhusbodarna are supposed to be the oldest houses in G\u00f6teborg. Unfortunately, you cannot visit everything there because some musicians live in it.",
          "I suppose it is a bit of a tourist trap, but I always enjoy taking visitors to see the old buildings & cobblestone courtyard. The glass blowers and the old-fashioned candy shop are sure to please! Don't make the mistake of staying here for a bite to eat, however. I was",
          "Those old buildings downtown Gothenburg once was the birthplace of the Swedish Parliament in 1621. The Kingdom of Sweden was for a short time run from here - which in that particular time was the heart of Nya L\u00f6d\u00f6se.",
          "Having lunch at the cafe, sat outside in the sun, is unbeatable. The lasagne here is consistently decent, the sandwiches good, the coffee strong. Not sure I would bother coming for lunch if I was going to sit inside, but love the outdoor seating.",
          "I don't know why this place isn't used more. It's a total tourist trap. The Crown House and the surrounding buildings are beautiful and the only remaining buildings in the old part of town (the rest was torn in the sixties), and it hosts some interesting Swedish history (used to",
          "This is a little area where handiworks are shown and there is a lovely cafe there - before Christmas they hold a gorgeous Christmas market.",
          "During the summer you can have a \"fika\" (coffee) here, and sit outside in the nice environment. There is also a old style candy shop, some small shops with differens hand crafts and a home interior shop. This is the oldest non church building in the city, and it is very well"

In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, he was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes. His Roman equivalent is Neptune.\nPoseidon was protector of seafarers, and of many Hellenic cities and colonies. In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War and in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, the complete loss of his ship and companions, and a ten-year delay. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn. In Plato's Timaeus and Critias, the island of Atlantis was Poseidon's domain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe earliest attested occurrence of the name, written in Linear B, is \ud800\udc21\ud800\udc2e\ud800\udc06\ud800\udc03 Po-se-da-o or \ud800\udc21\ud800\udc2e\ud800\udc06\ud800\udc3a\ud800\udc1a Po-se-da-wo-ne, which correspond to \u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd (Poseida\u014dn) and \u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03dd\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Poseidawonos) in Mycenean Greek; in Homeric Greek it appears as \u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd (Poseida\u014dn); in Aeolic as \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd (Poteida\u014dn); and in Doric as \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd (Poteidan), \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd (Poteida\u014dn), and \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1fb6\u03c2 (Poteidas). The form \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03dd\u03c9\u03bd (Poteidawon) appears in Corinth.The origins of the name \"Poseidon\" are unclear. One theory breaks it down into an element meaning \"husband\" or \"lord\" (Greek \u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (posis), from PIE *p\u00f3tis) and another element meaning \"earth\" (\u03b4\u1fb6 (da), Doric for \u03b3\u1fc6 (g\u0113)), producing something like lord or spouse of Da, i.e. of the earth; this would link him with Demeter, \"Earth-mother\". Walter Burkert finds that \"the second element \u03b4\u1fb6- remains hopelessly ambiguous\" and finds a \"husband of Earth\" reading \"quite impossible to prove.\" According to Robert Beekes,Etymological Dictionary of Greek, \"there is no indication that \u03b4\u1fb6 means 'earth'\".Another, more plausible, theory interprets the second element as related to the (presumed) Doric word *\u03b4\u1fb6\u03dd\u03bf\u03bd d\u00e2won, \"water\", Proto-Indo-European *dah\u2082- \"water\" or *d\u02b0enh\u2082- \"to run, flow\", Sanskrit \u0926\u0928\u094d d\u0101\u0301-nu- \"fluid, drop, dew\" and names of rivers such as Danube (< *Danuvius) or Don. This would make *Posei-daw\u014dn into the master of waters. There is also the possibility that the word has Pre-Greek origin. Plato in his dialogue Cratylus gives two traditional etymologies: either the sea restrained Poseidon when walking as a \"foot-bond\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd), or he \"knew many things\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd).At least a few sources deem Poseidon as a \"prehellenic\" (i.e. Pelasgian) word, considering an Indo-European etymology \"quite pointless\".The name of the Frisian and Scandinavian god Fosite or Forseti, who was venerated on the island of Heligoland, may have been derived from Poseidon. According to the German philologist, Hans Kuhn, the Germanic form *Fosite is linguistically identical to Greek Poseidon. Roman altars dedicated to Poseidon have been found in the Middle Rhine area.\n\n\n=== Epithets ===\nCommon epithets (or adjectives) applied to Poseidon are Enosichthon (\u1f18\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03c7\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd) \"Earth Shaker\" or \"earth-shaking\" and Ennosigaios (\u1f18\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), used by Homer in the Iliad and by Nonnus in Dionysiaca. Other epithets for Poseidon are Hippeios (\u1f32\u03c0\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) \"belonging to a horse\", Nauklarios (\u039d\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) \"belonging to the ship-owners\", Pelagikos (\u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) \"belonging to the sea\", Petraios (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u1f35\u03bf\u03c2) \"rocky, stony\", Ptortheion (\u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u0398\u03b5\u1f35\u03bf\u03bd) \"promotor of vegatation\", Thukios (\u03b8\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) \"full of seaweed\", as well as several others.\nOf the two phrases, Enosichthon has an older evidence of use, as it is identified in Linear B, as \ud800\udc01\ud800\udc1a\ud800\udc2f\ud800\udc05\ud800\udc03\ud800\udc1a, E-ne-si-da-o-ne,The epithets Ennosigaios (and Ennosidas) indicate the chthonic nature of Poseidon, that is to say, Poseidon was regarded as holding sway over land as well as the sea.Another epithet of Poseidon was \"Dark-Haired\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2).\n\n\n== Bronze Age Greece ==\n\n\n=== Linear B (Mycenean Greek) inscriptions ===\nIf surviving Linear B clay tablets can be trusted, the name po-se-da-wo-ne (\"Poseidon\") occurs with greater frequency than does di-u-ja (\"Zeus\"). A feminine variant, po-se-de-ia, is also found, indicating a lost consort goddess, in effect the precursor of Amphitrite. Poseidon carries frequently the title wa-na-ka (wanax) in Linear B inscriptions, as king of the underworld. The chthonic nature of Poseidon-Wanax is also indicated by his title E-ne-si-da-o-ne in Mycenean Knossos and Pylos, a powerful attribute (earthquakes had accompanied the collapse of the Minoan palace-culture). In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) Enesidaon is related with the cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth. She was related with the annual birth of the divine child. During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature, dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cult, and Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion (paredros) in Mycenean cult. It is possible that Demeter appears as Da-ma-te in a Linear B inscription (PN EN 609), however the interpretation is still under dispute.In Linear B inscriptions found at Pylos, E-ne-si-da-o-ne is related with Poseidon, and Si-to Po-tini-ja is probably related with Demeter. Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for \"the Two Queens and Poseidon\" (\"to the Two Queens and the King\": wa-na-soi, wa-na-ka-te). The \"Two Queens\" may be related with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods.\n\n\n=== Arcadian myths ===\nThe illuminating exception is the archaic and localised myth of the stallion Poseidon and mare Demeter at Phigalia in isolated and conservative Arcadia, noted by Pausanias (2nd century AD) as having fallen into desuetude; the stallion Poseidon pursues the mare-Demeter, and from the union she bears the horse Arion, and a daughter (Despoina), who obviously had the shape of a mare too. The violated Demeter was Demeter Erinys (furious) . In Arcadia, Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her xoanon of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her, as goddess of nature. A Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIt seems that the Arcadian myth is related with the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the Bronze Age. (Linear B represents an archaic Greek dialect). Their religious beliefs were mixed with the beliefs of the indigenous population. It is possible that the Greeks did not bring with them other gods except Zeus, Eos, and the Dioskouroi. The horse (numina) was related with the liquid element, and with the underworld. Poseidon appears as a beast (horse), which is the river spirit of the underworld, as it usually happens in northern-European folklore, and not unusually in Greece. Poseidon \"Wanax\", is the male companion (paredros) of the goddess of nature. In the relative Minoan myth, Pasipha\u00eb is mating with the white bull, and she bears the hybrid creature Minotaur. The Bull was the old pre-Olympian Poseidon. The goddess of nature and her paredros survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered: \"Mighty Potnia bore a strong son\".In the heavily sea-dependent Mycenaean culture, there is not sufficient evidence that Poseidon was connected with the sea. We do not know if \"Posedeia\" was a sea-goddess. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea following the defeat of his father Cronus, when the world was divided by lot among his three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three. Walter Burkert suggests that the Hellene cult worship of Poseidon as a horse god may be connected to the introduction of the horse and war-chariot from Anatolia to Greece around 1600 BC.It is almost sure that once Poseidon was worshiped as a horse, and this is evident by his cult in Peloponnesos. However he was originally a god of the waters, and therefore he became the \"earth-shaker\", because the Greeks believed that the cause of the earthquakes was the erosion of the rocks by the waters, by the rivers who they saw to disappear into the earth and then to burst out again. This is what the natural philosophers Thales, Anaximenes and Aristotle believed, which could not be different from the folklore belief. Later, when the Myceneans travelled along the sea, he was assigned a role as god of the sea.\nIn any case, the early importance of Poseidon can still be glimpsed in Homer's Odyssey, where Poseidon rather than Zeus is the major mover of events. In Homer, Poseidon is the master of the sea.\n\n\n== Worship of Poseidon ==\nPoseidon was a major civic god of several cities: in Athens, he was second only to Athena in importance, while in Corinth and many cities of Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis.In his benign aspect, Poseidon was seen as creating new islands and offering calm seas. When offended or ignored, he supposedly struck the ground with his trident and caused chaotic springs, earthquakes, drownings and shipwrecks. Sailors prayed to Poseidon for a safe voyage, sometimes drowning horses as a sacrifice; in this way, according to a fragmentary papyrus, Alexander the Great paused at the Syrian seashore before the climactic battle of Issus, and resorted to prayers, \"invoking Poseidon the sea-god, for whom he ordered a four-horse chariot to be cast into the waves.\"According to Pausanias, Poseidon was one of the caretakers of the oracle at Delphi before Olympian Apollo took it over. Apollo and Poseidon worked closely in many realms: in colonization, for example, Delphic Apollo provided the authorization to go out and settle, while Poseidon watched over the colonists on their way, and provided the lustral water for the foundation-sacrifice. Xenophon's Anabasis describes a group of Spartan soldiers in 400\u2013399 BC singing to Poseidon a paean\u2014a kind of hymn normally sung for Apollo.\nLike Dionysus, who inflamed the maenads, Poseidon also caused certain forms of mental disturbance. A Hippocratic text of ca 400 BC, On the Sacred Disease says that he was blamed for certain types of epilepsy.\n\n\n=== Epithets ===\n\nPoseidon was known in various guises, denoted by epithets. In the town of Aegae in Euboea, he was known as Poseidon Aegaeus and had a magnificent temple upon a hill. Poseidon also had a close association with horses, known under the epithet Poseidon Hippios, usually in Arcadia. He is more often regarded as the tamer of horses, but in some myths he is their father, either by spilling his seed upon a rock or by mating with a creature who then gave birth to the first horse. He was closely related with the springs, and with the strike of his trident, he created springs. Many springs like Hippocrene and Aganippe in Helikon are related with the word horse (hippos). (also Glukippe, Hyperippe). In the historical period, Poseidon was often referred to by the epithets Enosichthon, Seisichthon and Ennosigaios, and \u0393\u03b1\u03b9\u03ae\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 Gai\u0113ochos all meaning \"earth-shaker\" and referring to his role in causing earthquakes.\nSome other epithets of Poseidon are:\n\"Asphaleios\", (\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1: safety), as protector from the earthquakes.\n\"Helikonios\", (\u0395\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) related with the mountain Helikon.\n\"Tavreios\", (\u03a4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2: related with the bull). There was a fest \"Tavreia\" in Ephesos.\n\"Petraios\" (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2: related with rocks) in Thessaly. He hit a rock, and the horse \"Skyphios\" appeared.\n\"Epoptis\" (\u03b5\u03c0\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2: supervisor) in Megalopolis\n\"Pelagios\" in Ionia.\n\"Phykios\" (\u03a6\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2: related with seaweeds) in Mykonos.\n\"Phytalmios\" (\u03a6\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) related with the vegetation in Troizen, Megara, Rhodes.\nEpithets related with the genealogy trees: \"Patrigenios\", \"Genethlios\", \"Genesios\", \"Pater\", \"Phratrios\".\n\"Epactaeus\", meaning \"god worshipped on the coast\", in Samos.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n\n=== Birth ===\nPoseidon was the second son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. In most accounts he is swallowed by Cronus at birth and is later saved, along with his other brothers and sisters, by Zeus.\nHowever, in some versions of the story, he, like his brother Zeus, did not share the fate of his other brother and sisters who were eaten by Cronus. He was saved by his mother Rhea, who concealed him among a flock of lambs and pretended to have given birth to a colt, which she gave to Cronus to devour.According to John Tzetzes the kourotrophos, or nurse of Poseidon was Arne, who denied knowing where he was, when Cronus came searching; according to Diodorus Siculus Poseidon was raised by the Telchines on Rhodes, just as Zeus was raised by the Korybantes on Crete.\nAccording to a single reference in the Iliad, when the world was divided by lot in three, Zeus received the sky, Hades the underworld and Poseidon the sea.In Homer's Odyssey (Book V, ln. 398), Poseidon has a home in Aegae.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Athens ===\n\nAthena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon. Yet Poseidon remained a numinous presence on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate, Erechtheus. At the dissolution festival at the end of the year in the Athenian calendar, the Skira, the priests of Athena and the priest of Poseidon would process under canopies to Eleusis. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up; the water was salty and not very useful, whereas Athena offered them an olive tree.\nThe Athenians or their king, Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food. After the fight, infuriated at his loss, Poseidon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic Plain, to punish the Athenians for not choosing him. The depression made by Poseidon's trident and filled with salt water was surrounded by the northern hall of the Erechtheum, remaining open to the air. \"In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus,\" Walter Burkert noted; \"the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Poseidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus.\"\n\nThe contest of Athena and Poseidon was the subject of the reliefs on the western pediment of the Parthenon, the first sight that greeted the arriving visitor.\nThis myth is construed by Robert Graves and others as reflecting a clash between the inhabitants during Mycenaean times and newer immigrants. Athens at its height was a significant sea power, at one point defeating the Persian fleet at Salamis Island in a sea battle.\n\n\n=== Walls of Troy ===\nPoseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus by their rebellion in Hera's scheme, were temporarily stripped of their divine authority and sent to serve King Laomedon of Troy. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulfill. In vengeance, before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy. The monster was later killed by Heracles.\n\n\n=== Consorts and children ===\nPoseidon was said to have had many lovers of both sexes (see expandable list below). His consort was Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus and Doris. Together they had a son named Triton, a merman.\nPoseidon was the father of many heroes. He is thought to have fathered the famed Theseus.\n\nA mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson), but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus, and from their union were born the heroes Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Poseidon also had an affair with Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, his son and King of Eleusis, begetting the Attic hero Hippothoon. Cercyon had his daughter buried alive but Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis.Poseidon rescued Amymone from a lecherous satyr and then fathered a child, Nauplius, by her.\nAfter having raped Caeneus, Poseidon fulfilled her request and changed her into a male warrior.\nA mortal woman named Cleito once lived on an isolated island; Poseidon fell in love with the human mortal and created a dwelling sanctuary at the top of a hill near the middle of the island and surrounded the dwelling with rings of water and land to protect her. She gave birth to five sets of twin boys; the firstborn, Atlas, became the first ruler of Atlantis.Not all of Poseidon's children were human. In an archaic myth, Poseidon once pursued Demeter. She spurned his advances, turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses; he saw through the deception and became a stallion and captured her. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech. Poseidon also raped Medusa on the floor of a temple to Athena. Medusa was then changed into a monster by Athena. When she was later beheaded by the hero Perseus, Chrysaor and Pegasus emerged from her neck.\nHis other children include Polyphemus (the Cyclops) and, finally, Alebion and Bergion and Otos and Ephialtae (the giants).\n\n\n=== List of Poseidon's consorts and children ===\n\n\n==== Female lovers and offspring ====\nMale lovers\n\nNerites\nPelops\nPatroclus\n\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n\n== In literature and art ==\n\nIn Greek art, Poseidon rides a chariot that was pulled by a hippocampus or by horses that could ride on the sea. He was associated with dolphins and three-pronged fish spears (tridents). He lived in a palace on the ocean floor, made of coral and gems.\nIn the Iliad Poseidon favors the Greeks, and on several occasion takes an active part in the battle against the Trojan forces. However, in Book XX he rescues Aeneas after the Trojan prince is laid low by Achilles.\nIn the Odyssey, Poseidon is notable for his hatred of Odysseus who blinded the god's son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. The enmity of Poseidon prevents Odysseus's return home to Ithaca for many years. Odysseus is even told, notwithstanding his ultimate safe return, that to placate the wrath of Poseidon will require one more voyage on his part.\nIn the Aeneid, Neptune is still resentful of the wandering Trojans, but is not as vindictive as Juno, and in Book I he rescues the Trojan fleet from the goddess's attempts to wreck it, although his primary motivation for doing this is his annoyance at Juno's having intruded into his domain.\nA hymn to Poseidon included among the Homeric Hymns is a brief invocation, a seven-line introduction that addresses the god as both \"mover of the earth and barren sea, god of the deep who is also lord of Helicon and wide Aegae, and specifies his twofold nature as an Olympian: \"a tamer of horses and a saviour of ships.\"\nPoseidon appears in Percy Jackson and the Olympians as the father of Percy Jackson and Tyson the Cyclops. He also appears in the ABC television series Once Upon a Time as the guest star of the second half of season four played by Ernie Hudson. In this version, Poseidon is portrayed as the father of the Sea Witch Ursula.\n\n\n=== Narrations ===\n\nPoseidon myths as told by story tellersBibliography of reconstruction: \n\nHomer, Odyssey, 11.567 (7th century BC)\nPindar, Olympian Odes, 1 (476 BC)\nEuripides, Orestes, 12\u201316 (408 BC)\nBibliotheca Epitome 2: 1\u20139 (140 BC)\nOvid, Metamorphoses, VI: 213, 458 (AD 8);\nHyginus, Fables, 82: Tantalus; 83: Pelops (1st century AD)\nPausanias, Description of Greece, 2.22.3 (AD 160 \u2013 176)Bibliography of reconstruction: \n\nPindar, Olympian Ode, I (476 BC)\nSophocles, (1) Electra, 504 (430 \u2013 415 BC) & (2) Oenomaus, Fr. 433 (408 BC)\nEuripides, Orestes, 1024\u20131062 (408 BC)\nBibliotheca Epitome 2, 1\u20139 (140 BC)\nDiodorus Siculus, Histories, 4.73 (1st century BC)\nHyginus, Fables, 84: Oinomaus; Poetic Astronomy, ii (1st century AD)\nPausanias, Description of Greece, 5.1.3 \u2013 7; 5.13.1; 6.21.9; 8.14.10 \u2013 11 (c.

        "wiki": "Liseberg is an amusement park located in Gothenburg, Sweden, that opened in 1923. It is the most visited amusement park in Scandinavia, attracting about three million visitors annually.  Among the noteworthy attractions is the wooden roller coaster Balder, twice (2003 and 2005) voted as the Best Wooden Tracked Roller Coaster in the world in a major international poll. The park itself has also been chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes magazine.Additional to the summer season, the park is also open during November and December, albeit with fewer rides operating, hosting a Halloween season with various house of horrors and a Christmas market with traditional Swedish cuisine such as mulled wine and specialties such as d\u00f6ner kebab made from  reindeer meat.\nThe official colors of Liseberg are pink and green as can be seen on the entrance and the older houses in the park, the colors were also adopted for the logo, which was introduced in the 1980s, but changed in 2013 to the current logo.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1752, the landowner Johan Anders Lamberg named his property Lisas berg (\"Lisa's Mountain\") after his wife Elisabeth S\u00f6derberg. The area eventually became known as Liseberg.\nIn 1908, Gothenburg City bought the property, including the on-site buildings, for 225,000 Swedish kronor.\nIn 1923, Gothenburg celebrated its 300-year anniversary with the Gothenburg Exhibition, which included a Leisure Park and the Congress Park; the area was opened on 8 May and included fun slides and the 980 ft long wooden Kanneworffska Funicular, designed by the Danish amusement builder Waldemar Lebech (originally there were 5 trains with 3 cars each that accommodated 10 people in each car, the ride lasted 2 and half minute; the ride was demolished in 1987 after having served over 41 million visitors). The fun park was originally intended as a temporary attraction for the Exhibition, but it became such a success with over 800,000 visitors in just over a month, that it was kept open. With an area of 1,500,000 m\u00b2 the park had cost 2.6 million kronors to build.\nOn 24 November 1924, the Gothenburg City Council decided to purchase the Liseberg amusement park for 1 million kronors. In 1925, the amusement park was taken over by the municipal company Liseberg AB. The park's first director and one of its initiators was the legendary \"carpenter from Sk\u00e5ne\" Herman Lindholm, who managed it 1923\u201342.\nOn 13 August 1935, the functional-inspired Liseberg Bath was inaugurated, created by engineer KI Sch\u00f6n Anderson. The pool was 15 meters wide and 36 meters long and sported underwater Lights and artificial waves. The Pool was able to receive 800 people at a time, entrance fee with a cabin was 50 cents. The Swedish Olympic hopeful champion from 1920, Arvid Wallman, inaugurated the facilities. The pool was closed in 1956 and the building was demolished in 1962 for the forthcoming 40th anniversary in 1963.\n\nRotundan was one of the largest dancehalls when it opened on 10 January 1940. Its architect was Axel Jonson, and the construction lasted for one year at a cost of approximately 500,000 SEK. The dance floor held 1,200 persons and on the second floor a bar with the name Uggleklubben was opened. In 1956, the facility was renovated and its name changed to the Rondo. The architect Gunnar Aspe was behind the work, which cost 1 million dollars.\nIn 1947, Liseberg AB opened hotel facilities; Hotell Liseberg Heden. Right from the start one of the objectives of Liseberg was that it would be an opportunity for Gothenburg dwellers to experience recreation and the scenery, and in 1959 it opened the Princess Birgitta, a flower exhibition. During the opening ceremony, 15,000 roses were strewn over the park by helicopter. In 1977, Honor Place was founded, a collection of many of the world's largest celebrity hand impressions. At the time, there were 50 imprints; today, there are more than can fit the area, so an annual selection is made as to who should get the honor to appear.\nIn 1991, the Liseberg Guest AB was formed to oversee the running of Gothenburg campsites and harbor. In the 1990s the park was expanded by 35 000 square meters and a host of new attractions was inaugurated. In 2015 Lisebergs different companies consolidated into one: Liseberg AB.\n\n\n== The park ==\nIn addition to the park's more than 30 different rides, Liseberg has many venues (stages, dance hall, restaurants and arcade halls). The park has two entrances / exits (one at \u00d6rgrytev\u00e4gen, the other at Getebergsled). Much of the park is forested.\nIn 1983, the green-pink bunny, Liseberg Rabbit, became the park's symbol and mascot.\nIn 1998, That year's Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar N\u00e4r karusellerna sover was filmed there.\nThe park is noted for its Lisebergs Lustgarten (botanical garden) that is landscaped and has many waterfalls, artworks and a variety of plants.\nLiseberg Main Stage (Stora Scenen) was built in 1923 and was originally designed as a big music pavilion for the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and other large-scale concerts (over the years the design of the venue has been modified). Bands such as Abba and the Rolling Stones have performed here. Right next to the Stora Scenen is the smaller Kvarnteatern which plays host to various smaller events, in particular children's theater.\nPolka (Polketten) is the dance hall that was built in 1925 but has since been moved to its current location. The Taube Scene was inaugurated in 2008 and is named after Evert Taube; this venue is used for different types of music such as jazz, and the Liseberg Orchestra plays here as well.\nAdjacent to Liseberg Park are more venues: Lisebergshallen is an entertainment and sports arena, home to the local floorball team and team handball team. Rondo is the name of a show venue and Liseberg Theater is a local theater.\nMultifarious Swedish performers have performed at Liseberg since its opening. Among them, Zarah Leander, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Evert Taube, ABBA, Lasse Dahlquist, Birgit Nilsson, Pernilla Wahlgren and Carola H\u00e4ggkvist. Sten-\u00c5ke Cederh\u00f6k played in 25 years' own perceptions of the \u201cWeek Revy\u201d. Other artists like Sonya Hedenbratt, Hagge Geigert and Laila Westersund have appeared countless times at Liseberg. Olof Palme gave a speech on the main stage during his last election in 1985.\nInternational acts who have performed at Liseberg include Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Cliff Richard, Nightwish, Delta Rhythm Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cat Stevens, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, The Who, PJ Proby, Frank Zappa with The Mothers of Invention, Bill Haley & His Comets, Procol Harum, and Toto, among others.\nSince 2004 a sing-along show called Lotta p\u00e5 Liseberg (Lotta at Liseberg), hosted by Lotta Engberg, is held every summer at Stora scenen in Liseberg, which airs over TV4 since 2009.\n\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n\n\n=== Water rides ===\nFlumeRide \u2013 a 630 m log flume ride that has 2 drops, the higher of which is 14 m (opened in 1973).

        "wiki": "AtmosFear is a 116-metre-tall (381 ft) drop tower located in Liseberg amusement park in Gothenburg, Sweden, and is the second tallest drop tower in Europe. AtmosFear is designed by Intamin and drops riders from a height of 90 metres (300 ft).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1990, Liseberg built a 146-metre-tall (479 ft) observation tower named Lisebergstornet (The Liseberg Tower). After twenty years of operation. Liseberg closed the attraction and began to renovate the tower in May 2010. The tower became the main structure for AtmosFear which opened as the tallest drop tower in Europe in April 2011.\n\n\n== Ride ==\nAfter boarding the gondola, riders await in suspense as the catch mechanism lowers and hooks onto the gondola. Red warning lights begin to flash in the station area and the gondola is slowly hoisted skywards, with riders being subjected to a light spray of mist upon leaving the station structure.\nAfter a slow ascent to the summit of the tower, riders are presented with views over Liseberg and the surrounding Gothenburg. After several seconds, the catch mechanism releases the gondola. Riders plummet up to speeds of 68 miles per hour (109 km/h), pulling up to 4 G's before coming to a controlled halt at the bottom of the tower.\n\n\n== References ==\nAtmosfear, Liseberg\n\n\n== External links ==\nDrawings of Lisebergstornet at Skyscraper Page\nLisebergstornet at Emporis\nLiseberg Tower at Structurae",

        "wiki": "Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath) is a subgenre of death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) around 1993. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularise the style, soon centering in the \"Gothenburg metal\" scene.\n\n\n== Musical characteristics ==\nThe genre combines aspects of traditional heavy metal ranging as far as the new wave of British heavy metal, in particular fast riffing and harmonic guitar lines, with the heavily distorted guitars, fast double-bass drum patterns and occasional blast beats of death metal. The vocal style typically combines harsh screaming and growling with melodic singing, with some artists emphasizing one of these techniques over the rest. Melodic death metal drum patterns are often built around the \"skank beat\", similar to thrash metal.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nMuch of the origin and popularity of melodic death metal can be attributed to the bands At the Gates, In Flames, and Dark Tranquillity, whose early 1990s music releases defined the genre and laid the foundation for the Gothenburg metal scene. Writer Gary Sharpe-Young considered the Gothenburg scene the commercial salvation of death metal: \"Gothenburg became the new Tampa and the genre received a new lease on life.\" The titular melodic elements can be traced to traditional Scandinavian musical motifs. Another pioneer was the English band Carcass, which performed grindcore on its first two releases but morphed into death metal and an increasingly melodic style on the Necroticism \u2013 Descanting the Insalubrious (1991) and Heartwork (1993). Ceremonial Oath and Eucharist also played melodic death metal in the very early 1990s, however never gained much attentioned outside of their own scene.\n\n\n=== Late 1990s and expansion ===\nSince the late 1990s, melodic death metal bands have added more melodic choruses and riffs and have used keyboards more prominently than other death metal bands; their lyrics, unlike those of death metal, did not focus on death, violence, gore, horror, or blood, for the most part. However, bands prominent in the genre such as The Black Dahlia Murder have been described as maintaining the intensity of regular death metal, while incorporating elements from other extreme metal bands like Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. Additionally, other genres would begin using melodic death metal as an influence, including melodic metalcore and melodic black/death. Stewart Mason claims that melodic metalcore has become very popular in the United States, using the term \"Swedecore\" to describe Scandinavian-style metal as played by non-Nordic bands.\n\n\n== Influence on other genres ==\nMany melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. This style has been referred to as blackened melodic death metal, melodic blackened death metal and melodic black-death. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative. Some bands who have played this style include Dissection,  Sacramentum, Naglfar, Dawn, Unanimated, Thulcandra and Cardinal Sin.Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of metalcore and melodic death metal, with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, blast beats, metalcore-stylized breakdowns and clean singing. These bands often take influence from the guitar riffs and writing styles of Swedish melodic death metal bands, especially At the Gates, In Flames, Arch Enemy and Soilwork. Melodic metalcore bands include Poison the Well, 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Darkest Hour, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, Bury Tomorrow and I Killed the Prom Queen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of melodic death metal bands\nSwedish death metal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Gothenburg Botanical Garden (Swedish: G\u00f6teborgs botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rd) is located in Gothenburg, Sweden, and is one of the larger botanical gardens in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Gothenburg Botanical Garden  is situated in a formerly completely rural area, where earlier a great country estate named Stora \u00c4ngg\u00e5rden  was located. The Garden was initially funded by a donation from the Charles Felix Lindberg Foundation, in special memory of Charles Felix Lindberg himself. Lindberg was a Swedish businessman and donor, who died in 1909.\nThe Gothenburg City Council took the initiative to the Botanical Garden in 1912. The decision was finally taken in 1915 and work started in 1916. The park was opened to the public in 1919 (the Woodlands) and in 1923 (the cultivated areas). It was first planned as \u201da field for experimentation and biological demonstrations, and a nature park\u201d. Stora \u00c4ngg\u00e5rden was built in 1812 and renovated under the supervision of the architect Sigfrid Ericson in 1919 and is now used as staff residence.\nThe Gothenburg Botanical Garden was inaugurated in 1923 when Gothenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary.\nOne of the prominent botanists who created the garden was Carl Skottsberg, who made several research trips around the globe to collect the rare plants of the garden. He was appointed as the first director, and worked from 1919 until 1948. The road outside the Main Entrance is named after him (Carl Skotttsbergs gata).\nDonations from many sources have played a vital role in the financing of the garden, including financing the construction of the Office Building. The Office Building was designed by the Swedish architect Arvid Bjerke and completed in 1926. A wing was added in 1936 to house the herbarium.\nLand was donated by the City and by private persons. An adjacent plot of land was donated by the City to Gothenburg University for the construction of the Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences buildings, to the right seen from the Main Entrance. They were designed by the architects Stig Hansson and Walter Kiessling and completed in 1971. In 1975 The Woodlands containing the arboretum with a collection of exotic trees were declared as a Nature reserve in 1975 and was named \u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergen.\nThe City of Gothenburg handed over the operation of the Garden to Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland Regional Council in 1998.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe total area is 175 hectares (ca 430 acres), of which most constitutes the nature reserve, \u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergen, including an arboretum.\nThe garden proper is about 40 hectares and there are 16,000 different species. The Rock Garden has received two stars in the Michelin Green Guide. Other sights worth seeing are The Rhododendron Valley, the Japanese Glade and the greenhouses with about 4,000 various plants, including some 1,500 orchids, a remarkable tufa apartment and the rare Easter Island Tree, Sophora toromiro.\nThe park is unique in Sweden since it is independent of the city university. Currently it is one of the larger botanical gardens in Europe, with its 175 hectares, which include a wild nature reserve in the \u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergen hills. This reserve is also the site of the Garden\u2019s arboretum with copses of trees from many parts of the world, in scientifically ordered collections. The cultivated part of the Garden is about 40 hectares in area, of which about half consists of beds of plants. There are also extensive lawns and shrubberies.   \nThe symbol of the garden is a white wood anemone. These flowers carpet the valleys of the Woodlands and the Nature Reserve in the spring.\n\n\n== Park, greenhouses and buildings ==\nThe topography of the botanical garden is very varied, much of it consisting of hilly terrain which lends itself naturally to boundaries drawn between different layouts with contrasting vegetation. The huge and dramatic rock garden with its 5,000 species from different continents is internationally acknowledged. Nearby is the greenly peaceful Japanese Glade where valuable plants can be seen that were collected and brought in the 1950s by former curator Tor Nitzelius straight from their wild habitats in East Asia to the botanical garden in Gothenburg. \nThe stock of over 500 species and cultivated varieties of Rhododendron offer a gorgeous, scented spectacle in the early summer. At different times of the year visitors may also enjoy the world\u2019s largest collection of bulbs and tuberous plants brought here straight from their wild habitats. The pretty Herb Garden, the lush beds of perennials and not least the Kitchen Garden with its crop rotation and typically Swedish syringa arbour are all interesting in their special ways. The Gothenburg Botanical Garden has been well to the fore with a new outlook on how to grow annual plants; the so-called summer blooming concept. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nAs many as 16,000 plant species can be seen out-of-doors as well as 4,000 species in the greenhouses. Among them are Sweden\u2019s finest collection of 1,500 orchids and the unique Toromiro Tree (Sophora toromiro) from Easter Island. This tree has become extinct in its natural habitat, but has survived in cultivated form thanks to the efforts of the Gothenburg Botanical Garden. \n\nThe impressive yellow-painted country house Stora \u00c4ngg\u00e5rden with its formal garden lies just beyond the greenhouses. It is used as a staff residence, as is the picturesque timbered Boatsman\u2019s Cottage, also known as the Blue House. Built in 1794, it was originally situated in the old harbour area of Gothenburg, below Stigbergstorget in the residential area of Majorna. In 1917 it was taken down and rebuilt two years later in its present place near the Bamboo Thickets.\nThe summerhouse in the Herb Garden is from the late eighteenth century. It was designed by the city engineer in Gothenburg Bengt Wilhelm Carlberg for the garden of his own country house, K\u00e4rralund. It was rebuilt in the botanical garden in 1959 after having stood for a time in a garden between the R\u00f6hsska Museum and the present-day HDK (School of Design and Crafts).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2003 the Gothenburg Botanical Garden was voted the loveliest park in Sweden, in a version of the international poll initiated by Briggs & Stratton, one of the leading manufacturers of garden machinery. It was the first time the competition had been arranged in Sweden.\nThe Botanical Garden has two stars in the Michelin Green Guide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Gothenburg Botanical Garden at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "The Keillers Park murder is a famous Swedish criminal case. On 23 July 1997 the body of an unknown man was discovered in a park in the city of Gothenburg, in western Sweden. The man, who had been shot twice with a pistol, was identified two days later as Josef ben Meddour (aged 36), a homosexual and Algerian national, who had been living in Sweden for many years.\nAfter many months of investigation, the police were able to apprehend the two murderers. They were named as Jon N\u00f6dtveidt (aged 22), the leader of black metal band Dissection, and his friend Vlad (aged 20), an Iranian national settled in Sweden. The two men, who confessed to their crime, were eventually sentenced by a court of appeal to ten years of incarceration. Vlad was also a suspect in other murder and assault cases around that time.N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad, who were members of Temple of the Black Light, had on several occasions discussed performing human sacrifices before they murdered Meddour. That the motive was occult-related could not however be clearly established, and the murder was described as a homophobic hate crime by the Swedish police.\n\n\n== Discovery of the body ==\nOn 23 July 1997, at around 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy discovered the body of a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Gothenburg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.No identification was found on the corpse, but a female police officer recognized the man as someone who was often seen in the area of Svingeln square and who, with his curled hair and sunglasses, looked like Swedish singer Magnus Uggla. In the neighbourhood, a shop attendant told the police that the actual name of the victim was Josef and that he was often in the company of a Finnish-looking man. Thanks to this testimony, the police were able to identify Josef ben Meddour, aged 36, an Algerian national. Settled in Sweden for about ten years, Meddour was gay, and the Finnish-looking man was his boyfriend.\n\n\n== First leads ==\nThe police first suspected the victim's boyfriend. The head cap recovered near the body was his, he had no alibi, and the couple was known for their frequent arguments. After twelve days in custody, the boyfriend was nevertheless released, and he was later cleared of all suspicion.The investigators then learned that on the evening of 22 July, Meddour had received the visit of militants of the GIA, an Algerian Islamic organisation. As Meddour himself was known for his opposition to the GIA, the police considered the possibility of a political assassination. Other people were interrogated, but leading to no breakthrough, and the investigators soon realised they were headed in the wrong direction.\n\n\n== Arrests ==\n \nOn 15 December 1997, a 23-year-old woman entered a police station in Stockholm, the Swedish capital. She wanted to file a complaint against her boyfriend Vlad, whom she accused of beating her, and threatening to kill her. She also told the police officers present that Vlad had once confessed to her that he was, along with his friend Jon, the perpetrator of the Keillers Park murder.The story that Vlad had told the young woman was as follows: he and N\u00f6dtveidt met Meddour in a street of Gothenburg, and invited him to follow them to Keillers Park. There, they first tried to immobilise him with an electroshock weapon (Taser), which somehow did not succeed. Meddour tried to run away, but Vlad shot him in the back with a pistol. While Meddour was lying on the ground, Vlad handed the gun to N\u00f6dtveidt, who shot a second bullet into his head.The 23-year-old woman also told the police that she knew the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Alerted, police investigators in Gothenburg could only acknowledge that observations made on the crime scene matched the woman's account of the events. Vlad was arrested the same day at his home in Stockholm. He was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol. N\u00f6dtveidt was apprehended in Gothenburg on the morning of 18 December.\n\n\n== Confessions ==\nThe two suspects at first denied any involvement in Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, N\u00f6dtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Gothenburg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who at the sight of their clothes asked them if they were Satanists, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad tried to push back the unknown man, but he insisted. This was how they came to know Meddour.The two friends eventually invited Meddour to follow them to N\u00f6dtveidt's home. While on the way, Meddour's behaviour and speech made clear he was a homosexual, which made N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad feel angry and offended. Once they reached N\u00f6dtveidt's home, Meddour appeared scared and refused to step in. N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad then suggested continuing their discussion about Satanism at Keillers Park. The three men hit the streets again, but before they left, N\u00f6dtveidt entered his flat to pick up the pistol and the Taser. Once at Keillers Park, Vlad took the Taser from N\u00f6dtveidt, and tried unsuccessfully to immobilise Meddour. Meddour attempted to run away, but his escape was cut short when Vlad shot a first bullet in his back, followed by a second bullet in his head.When faced with his contradictions, Vlad also confessed to the murder. His version of the events was very similar to N\u00f6dtveidt's, apart from one significant difference: according to him, N\u00f6dtveidt was the one who had held the gun, and who had pulled the trigger twice.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe investigation led the Gothenburg police into the world of black metal and Satanism.\n\n\n=== Black metal ===\n\nN\u00f6dtveidt was the leader of a musical band, Dissection, that had earned some fame in the small world of early black metal, a subgenre of heavy metal characterised by the occultism and raw violence of its lyrics, and by the extreme behaviour and lifestyle of its followers. In the middle of the nineties, the brief history of black metal was already riddled with violent deaths.In 1991, Per Ohlin, the Swedish singer of a Norwegian band called Mayhem, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun. His body was found by the band's leader, \u00d8ystein Aarseth, who instead of calling the police immediately, left to buy a disposable camera, and came back to take photographs of the corpse, which were eventually used for the bootleg live album Dawn of the Black Hearts (whose creator, Mauricio Montoya Botero, died in 2002 by suicide.). Aarseth also picked up fragments of his friend's skull, which ended up on a display shelf at the Helvete record shop in Oslo.The following year, B\u00e5rd 'Faust' Eithun, a co-worker of Aarseth stabbed a homosexual man in a street of Lillehammer. The murderer later stated homophobia as the motive for his act. Aarseth himself was stabbed to death in 1993 by a Norwegian musician, Varg Vikernes, who was known for his solo project Burzum. Vikernes claims that the murder was in fact an act of self-defense, as Aarseth had allegedly planned to murder him. Vikernes \u2013 who was also accused of burning three churches - was sentenced in 1994 to 21 years behind bars.\n\n\n=== Satanism ===\n\nWhen the arrests were made on 15 and 18 December 1997, the police discovered satanic altars in the homes of the two suspects. A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts. N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad were members of a satanic organization called Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO), of which Vlad was one of the founders, and that, according to the police, never had more than a handful of followers.During their investigations, the police interrogated former members of the MLO, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons, and animal sacrifices (specifically cats, which were bought through classified ads). During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at N\u00f6dtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even N\u00f6dtveidt's girlfriend.These plans led to the defection of some members of the MLO, who did not want to take part in any assassination, or who feared for their own lives. As a result, when the arrests were made, the number of active members was down to three: N\u00f6dtveidt, Vlad, and his girlfriend.\n\n\n== Trials ==\nThe motives of the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about? Or was it rather a hate crime, motivated by the anger N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, there is no denying that N\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.On 6 July 1998, N\u00f6dtveidt was sentenced by the Gothenburg district court to eight years of prison for assistance to murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Vlad was sentenced to ten years for murder, violence against his girlfriend, illegal possession of a firearm and possession of body parts. All three parties appealed to the verdict.The Court of Appeal for Western Sweden gave its verdict on 25 September 1998. N\u00f6dtveidt was this time sentenced to ten years in prison, just as Vlad, whose sentence was confirmed.\n\n\n== Epilogue ==\nN\u00f6dtveidt and Vlad were released in 2004, after spending seven years behind bars. N\u00f6dtveidt committed suicide in 2006. His body was found at his home, surrounded by a ring of candles, a ritual book by his side. \nJosef ben Meddour's body was repatriated to Algeria. He was buried in the national capital, Algiers.\n\n\n== In books and films ==\nHilton, Johan (2006).

          "Worth a visit to see a panoramic view of the city. Quite a steep climb up to the top but for those that want to you can drive up and park at the top. A one way system operates for cars",

          "There are not many parks in this part of Goteborg and this one is the largest. Looks more like a forrest - interesting as there were almost no trees some 200 years ago! It is worth to come to the top of Rembergs hill (raven hill) for the best views..",
          "A must and preferably within your first Days of stay in Gothenburg due to the great 360 you get and a hinch of where `things`are located. You are very much right in the center of Gbg and get this view of all locations Worth visiting and their whereabouts . On a clear day you can",
          "This is perfect if you want a long uphill walk through a forest. When you do get to the top the view is a bit disappointing, as it looks over Gothenburg's industrial district and shipyards. Anyone looking for a more historical view I would recommend Skansen Kronan.",
          "If you are in Gothenburg, Ramberget or Keillers Park is a must-do! On the very top of the mountain you can see a beautiful view of Gothenburg. And if you're lucky there may be a concert in Ullevi and you can see in the evening how Ullevi glows up in the dark. Absolutely amazing.",

        "wiki": "The Gothenburg opera house (Swedish: G\u00f6teborgsoperan) is an opera house at Lilla Bommen in Gothenburg, Sweden. Since 2012, Stephen Langridge has served as the theatre's Artistic Director.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Gothenburg opera house is relatively new: construction started in September 1989 after significant local commitment in the late 1980s (with as many as 6,000 contributors to the new house) and it was completed with great speed. Ground breaking took place in June 1991, and the building was inaugurated in October 1994.\nIt hosted Melodifestivalen 2000, the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n== Building and capacity ==\nThe result was an auditorium built in the classical style. With its stalls and balconies, it has 1,301 seats. The orchestra pit has room for about 100 musicians. The House is shared by opera, ballet, musicals and operettas so the architects had to meet a number of challenges.\nIt is a large house \u2013 160 metres long and 85 metres wide at its widest \u2013 and the building is 32 metres high. The floor area is 28,700 square metres. The main stage is 500 square metres, while the stage opening is 20 metres (66 ft) high and 9 metres (30 ft) wide. There are four movable platforms that each can carry a weight of 15 tons. The stage can be lit by 1000 spotlights with 250 automatic color scrollers and 900 dimmer lights.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe architect, Jan Izikowitz, shares his vision of the house:\n\nThe building should be possessed by an airiness that sends your mind soaring across the meandering landscape like wings of seagulls. Its shape should be inspired by its location, from the magnificent but elusive landscape with its light and open spaces, to the harbor's more tangible technical constructions; the bridges gracefully suspended across the water, the transparent framework of the harbor cranes, the strength, softness and elegance of the ships' hulls, the wings of seagulls and the flawless aerodynamic shape of sails.\nHe reflects on the operatic aspect of the design: \"The world of opera should also be visible in the architecture: the rear stage wall as a large set piece, the colonnade as a series of symbolic gates and stage openings, the fly towers as gigantic lighting towers, the shape and color of the auditorium as an allusion to old traditions.\"\nThe overall size of the building is a reflection of the company's growth and its spread throughout the city. Therefore, the building attempts to encompass all the activities that were earlier spread out at six different locations are now housed in one building. Another reason is that the G\u00f6teborg Opera should be able to offer as wide a selection of productions as possible, with the possibility of changing performance and art form from one night to another. There can be five assembled stage sets stored in the house at the same time, in five different areas the same size as the main stage. With the help of advanced modern technology, whole stage sets can be moved around, exchanged and assembled for the next performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Balder, really good mountain track with many negative g. Gender is, however, horrible. 50 min feels like double. The grade is full for the funicular without taking into account the queues!\n\n",

Since 1822 it has served other purposes.\nThe fortress and the twin counterpart, Skansen Kronan, were built according to plans by Erik Dahlbergh as part of the defenses against possible Danish attack on Gothenburg from the south, and thus had a similar purpose as the \u00c4lvsborg fortress. \nThe fortress \u2014 originally built outside the city walls \u2014 is today centrally situated in the city of Gothenburg. It's run by a fraternal order, G\u00f6tiska f\u00f6rbundet, and is used also as a rented local for wedding banquettes, conferences and private parties. The dining hall takes 90 guests.\n\n\n== Gullberg's fortress ==\n\nSkansen Lejonet was erected on the site for an older fortress, known as Gullbergs hus, first mentioned in 1303. It was many times destroyed by the Danes, and again rebuilt by the Swedes. Gullberg is the name of the hill of the fortress.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

          "Great views over the built-up area of greater Gothenburg, very pleasant at sundown when the lights of the city make the climb worthwhile.",
          "It can be a bit of a climb to reach the top, I would suggest not using the steps and use the path instead. The view from the top is great but outside of the small hut making coffee and waffles there is not much here apart from the view.",
          "On a very warm July afternoon we spotted the tower from the streets of Gothenburg and just had to discover more. After climbing many steps we were rewarded with views in all directions and took advantage of the photographic opportunities. Go, see and do, if you are disappointed",
          "Our group of friends from the U.S. thoroughly enjoyed this historic structure ... the views from here are amazing learning about the history of how this fort was used was really cool.",
          "We are going to get married next year and this is a great place to have it! The staff is great and very helpful and the food looks delicious. An awesome place to have a wedding!",
          "Great views over the city and a nice tranquil place to relax. Steps leading up were rewarded with a nice breeze, green trees and great views. All in all a nice stop on a stroll through the city.",
          "there is rather interesting way to get there over the set of stairs. spectacular view from the top place. lovely part of Goteborg.",
          "Nice view from up there / somewhat of a walk to get there / cafe and pub had good beer at a reasonable price...",
          "Excellent historical building, with a marvellous view of Gothenburg below. Many many steps going up on the city side, but we walked down a gently sloping path, which was much easier!",
          "Climb up to the skansen Lejonet is amazing, you get in contact with the nature and by the end such a good surprise, a take breath landscape!",
          "Well, we have been here many times since it now is used in the most diversive ways. Last time I was there they were arranging \"Julbord\" (a lot of food that is served around Christmas - buff\u00e9) What makes it special is the surroundings and the really old preserved genuine tower",
          "Climbed upteen steps to have a coffee in the cafe at the top to overlook the city. However there was a private function happening so had to make do with a windy wet visit outside instead. Good views but I wouldn't waste your breathe.",
          "It's worth a stroll around this building if you are passing, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit as there is not much to see, the views outside are pretty good though.",
          "Despite a long stairs which must be climbs up to the top of the hill, this place worth to be seen. The view on the city is amazing, perfect for a romantic sunset.",
          "worth the walk up the hill or up the steps to look out over Gothenburg. I missed the guided tour time which would be interesting but its a great building to see up close and enjoy the views",
          "A beautiful fortress offering nice views of the city, however, not easily accessibly for the public. Skansen krona is better suited for tourists IMO",
          "A little walk up to the top of the hill and you'll the Skansen Lejonet tower as well as some fantastic views of Gothenburg. I visited on a rainy day and still enjoyed the views, but went again at midnight and it was a great sight to see the city illuminated. All free, so",
          "Although Skansen Kronan is in a better location (in terms of scenery), when I visited this place, I had the pleasure of being taken around by one of the men working (volunteering?) there. For me, it was very educational. This tower is fairly close to Central Station so it's",
          "We headed out of the main station the wrong side which then meant it was difficult to get to as we needed to cross the train tracks. We were pushed for time so didn't make it up the hill to the top. However from afar you could see the hill was not high enough to offer great",
          "A beautiful view of the city. It is very worth the short walk up to this place, however once at the top there isn't much to do other than stare at the city and wonder what else there is to do",
          "It is quite a hike to conquer a top of this hill. But, the surrounding view is worth it even tough highly industrialized. I visited this site during January, and unfortunately the Skansen itself was not opened to enter. It maybe different in summer months. Definitely worth to",
          "It is a big climb but worth it for the view over the city. During our visit the fort itself was inaccessible however, that might be different at different times of the year?",
          "The view en walk is really nice. There are a few signs that tell you the history which is really nice. If it has rained it can be really slippery.",
          "This is situated on a small hill and hence provides a vantage point for scenic view of the city and good photo-op. Very close to Haga, you can walk up to skansen through steps or a road. Unfortunately for us it snowed the previous night and walking up the slushy steps was",
          "A nice old building with some good history, worth a quick look if you're in the area. However the view from the top is a depressing industrial wasteland, certainly not a decent view over the city.",
          "A short distance from Haga, this is definitely worth a walk up the hill, lovely views of the city. Just a shame you can't see inside the building.",
          "Very cool building with a nice view! The trip is a bit challenging, but I highly recommend it in the end. A must see when in Gothenburg",
          "Arrived on the top, you cannot only see the beautiful building but have also a great view over the city, not recommanded for people who don't like to walk",
          "Had a nice stroll with 4 children running all over the place. Good break from city sight-seeing. Climbing the hill is good for Your health too!",
          "If you are in the Haga area and in good physical condition and able to invest some time, then walk up to the Skansen Lejonet. You will be rewarded with nice views over Gothenberg. As well, on a sunny day, you can also have a nice picnic next to the cannons around.",
          "Me and a friend decided to go whilst we were in Haga. If you aren't that keen of a walker, it may be a little tough climbing the steps (thinking of the older folk) but it's still very achievable and worth while. We weren't up there too long, nor did we go inside but very",
          "We walked a tour inside Skansen Lejonet itbwas informative and we got a good understanding of how it was use in the old days. It dates back to the 1700 century, it was used for defending Gothenburg.. It is only open on specific times so you better check the web site before."

        "wiki": "Gothenburg Cathedral (Swedish: Gustavi domkyrka / G\u00f6teborgs domkyrka) is a cathedral in Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. It is the seat of the bishop of the diocese of Gothenburg in the Church of Sweden.\n\n\n== Original church ==\nBefore the first cathedral was inaugurated in 1633, a temporary church known as the Gothenburg stave church (Swedish: Br\u00e4dekyrkan) stood on the site for approximately 12 years. This was one of the city's first buildings and the first church in the current city of Gothenburg, which is the third city founded at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta River and the second to have that name.\n\n\n== The first cathedral ==\n\nThe rectory was completed in 1624, and the construction of a new church on the site of the stave church was announced in 1627. King Gustavus Adolphus created a tax to pay for the work. The initial demand was for a barrel (just over 125 litres) of wheat, oats, barley or rye from each church-owned property in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland province for a three-year period. In a letter to Gothenburg's town council (13 December 1629) the tax was extended for three more years. From 1625 to 1634, construction costs increased to 8,387 Swedish riksdaler.\nConstruction was led by master mason Lars Nilsson. The foundation stone was laid by Gothenburg's justitiepresident (judge) Nils B\u00f6rjesson Drakenberg on 19 June 1626, and in 1633 the new main building was complete. By 1633, the stave church had been torn down, although its tower remained in use as a guard tower. During the construction period and for some time thereafter, the church was called stora kyrkan (the great church), the name used in the accounting records. It remained standing for nine more years, until a new tower replaced it in January 1643.On 10 and 11 August 1633 superintendent Andreas Prytz consecrated the church with two sermons: \"On the right use of churches\" and \"On the consecration of churches\". The inauguration is commemorated at the cathedral with an annual sermon on 10 August. The church was not designated as a cathedral (domkyrke) until the 1680s.No contemporary documents relating to the installation of the church bells have been found. The bells are mentioned retrospectively by Eric Cederbourg (1739):\n\nIn the tower were hung three large and beautiful bells, whose strong and harmonious sound could be heard for [over 8 km]; on the north wall of the tower a large, well-founded bell of 6 skeppspund [1,020 kg] weight was erected to chime the hour.\nThe first tower clock mechanism, made by clockmaker Per Larsson in 1648, was replaced in 1670 by one made by Jacob Hertingk of Stralsund.The church was built of granite, faced with Dutch bricks and adorned with 18 iron-trimmed Palladian windows placed between buttressing supports. It had an ornate arched entry door with iron fittings. The building was 48.1 metres long, 20.2 metres wide and 26.5 metres high at the pediment roof. It had no transept. The tower wall was 27.6 feet high, not counting its spire. The church roof was clad with oak shingles and topped with copper plates; on the eastern end of the roof was a weather vane in the form of a large copper-gilded sun, which in 1700 had been so weakened that it was replaced with a wooden cap. The cathedral spire was demolished and replaced in 1700.\n\n\n=== The cathedral interior ===\nThe cathedral had seventeen octagonal weight-bearing columns: eight on each side of the nave and one in the choir. They had a square socle. Each side was two ells (1.2 metres) wide.The original pulpit was of the German-Dutch type, and its intarsia and other carving work suggests that it had been crafted either in L\u00fcbeck or by some North Germans residing in Gothenburg. It was replaced in the late 1670s and transferred to the newly built Kung\u00e4lvs Church in 1682. Sculptor Marcus Jaeger the Elder carved the new pulpit with historical images in alabaster and ebony in 1674. He also made the baptismal font and executed numerous carvings on the lecterns and pews.The cathedral included a throne (a royal pew) placed over grave No. 19 to the south of the nave, between the first two pillars from the chancel. Jaeger completed it in the 1680s and was paid 960 silver riksdaler for it. In 1869 tailor Torsten Gunnarsson upholstered the throne in red velvet, probably in honour of Charles XI's 10 September visit to Gothenburg. Four years later, for 400 silver riksdaler, John Hammer painted the king's throne in white alabaster and gold.\nThe first organ, probably a positive organ with only four to six stops, had been installed by 1648. In 1661 organ builder Hans Horn completed a new pipe organ, and further work on it was completed around 1700. Jaeger was hired in 1697 to produce four Corinthian pillars beneath the organ to elevate it, probably in the west part of the nave, near the tower wall. The organ was repaired several times: in 1696 by Christian R\u00fcdiger, in 1699 by John George Ambthor and in 1707 by Elias Wittig. Both R\u00fcdiger and Ambthor were German organ masters; Wittig was a journeyman.\n\n\n=== Cathedral designation ===\n\nThe church was part of the established Church of Sweden and was initially named \"Gustavi church\" after Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. It was also known as the Swedish Church (Swedish: Svenska kyrkan), to distinguish it from Gothenburg's German Church (Swedish: Tyska kyrkan). With the change from superintendency to bishopric and the establishment of a cathedral chapter in 1665, it was elevated to cathedral status.\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nThe city's oldest cemetery was located at the foot of Kvarnberget, west of Kronhuset \u2014 once an armoury and now a historical museum and concert site \u2014 on the corner of the present Torggatan, then called Kyrkog\u00e5rdsgr\u00e4nden and Sillgatan (now Postgatan). By 1645 the marshy area around the cathedral had been filled with sand and could be used as a burial ground. The square, known by 1846 as Domkyrkoplatsen (Cathedral Square) and by 1883 as Domkyrkoplanen (Cathedral Close) 1883, had since 1644 been demarcated by a wall with arched gates to the north and south.\n\n\n== The second cathedral ==\nOn the night of 15 April 1721 the cathedral, high school and 211 residential buildings in the vicinity of the cathedral burned down. As the cathedral walls remained standing, it was possible to restore the building quite quickly. Barely a month after the fire, at the request of city manager (politieborgm\u00e4stare) Hans von Gerdes (1637\u20131723), the architect Paul Ludvig Leyonsparre presented three options for rebuilding the church, the third of which was recommended by county governor (landsh\u00f6vding) Nils Posse. The cathedral reopened on 25 May 1722, only 13 months after the fire, with the same dimensions as the old cathedral, but with a tower capital instead of the former spire. The roof proved to be so leaky that county governor Axel Gyllenkrok complained in October 1724 of rain and snow getting through. In December 1725 the city engineer was instructed to draw up proposals for a new copper roof covering, and work began in June 1726.The tower took another ten years to complete, and city engineer Johan Eberhard Carlberg (an uncle of Carl Wilhelm Carlberg, the architect of the current cathedral) designed a temporary belfry for the churchyard. It could not be put into service until 1726 because the bell had to be cast in a foundry, but it was in use for six years, until 1732, when the new tower was finally brought into service.\nThe new tower was designed by the builder of the German Christinenkirche tower, the naval master builder Nicolaus M\u00fcller. It closely resembled that of the German church, and contemporary pictures of even show it having a similar cap. The tower was octagonal and its top was 26.7 metres above the tower wall. The largest of the three church bells weighed 1,700 kg, while the other two each weighed 1,020 kg. They were cast in 1726 by Erik N\u00e4sman, who had moved from J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping to Stockholm and who cast a bell for Skara Cathedral the following year.The ceiling came into place between 1734 and 1739. The south-side lectern was finished in 1739. The floor was completed in April 1740 with 1,400 tiles of \u00d6land limestone, 2 Swedish ells (59.4 cm) square and 2.25 Swedish inches (5.57 cm) thick. In October 1731, Carlberg received approval for his drawing of a (provisional) pulpit. An organ was built in 1733\u20131734 by the organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman. A contract signed on 11 January 1733 specified that it was to be completed \"in a good and perfect state, equal to the organ works now to be found in Uppsala\". The organ cost 8,500 silver riksdaler, and was equipped with 32 stops and 5 bellows.In January 1750, superintendent Carl H\u00e5rleman proposed a sculpted altarpiece to portray Christ, a cross and two kneeling angels. The cost of the artwork was donated by pharmacist Franz Martin Luth (1679\u20131763). The contract was assigned on 1 March 1751, the altar was completed on 1 February 1754, and it was inaugurated on Advent Sunday, 1 December 1754. It is still used as the altar of the cathedral.\nIn 1769 a charnel house was built on the northwestern part of the cathedral block, on the corner of Kyrkogatan and V\u00e4stra Hamngatan, with space for forty coffins. To avoid a bad smell in the church, the mayor and council (magistrat ) of Gothenburg decided that all corpses buried during the six warmer months from 1 April to 1 October would first be stored in the charnel house.In the same year as the charnel house was added, the churchyard wall was also finished. It was a 469-ell (approximately 279 metres) wall around Domkyrkoplanen, with a granite footing; the wall itself was of brick and covered by large blocks of chiselled \u00d6land limestone. Set into the walls were five spacious gates built of hard-fired clinker brick and covered with sheet lead. The materials from three of these gates were moved after the 1802 fire to the new cemetery at the poorhouse meadow in the Stampen ward of Gothenburg.\nIn 1775, French sculptor Pierre Hubert Larchevesque (1721\u20131778) sculpted a cathedral monument to Colin Campbell (1686\u20131757), the co-founder of the Swedish East India Company.\n\n\n== The third (current) cathedral ==\nThe second cathedral burned down on 20 December 1802 along with 179 houses.  John Hall the Elder's funeral had been held in the cathedral shortly before, and his remains were still there, waiting for the completion of a large tomb at the \u00d6rgryte Cemetery, so both the corpse and the costly coffin were destroyed. The graves in the cemetery surrounding the cathedral were also so badly damaged that the churchyard had to be abandoned as a burial ground. Burials were moved to the \"New Cemetery\" at Stampen, which opened on 11 May 1804 and was originally intended only for the congregations of the cathedral and of the Christinenkirche. Materials from the demolished cathedral walls and three iron gates were sold at auction, and the proceeds were used for a new cemetery enclosure at Stampen.This time, the building was so severely damaged that the walls could not be reused. The building of a new church started in 1804. The grounds of the old church were reused to the extent that they coincided with the new building (the transept did not exist previously, for example).  Stones from the old church were used for private buildings, including the \"Ingelmanska house\" in the East Harbor Road. The church was consecrated by Bishop Johan Wing\u00e5rd on Trinity Sunday, 21 May 1815.\nThe new cathedral was designed by architect Carl Wilhelm Carlberg. He died on 14 April 1814 and construction was completed by his pupil, Major Justus Frederick Weinberg. It is said that Weinberg did not attend the inauguration for fear that the church's thin, flat arches would collapse (in the early 20th century the structure was reinforced). When the church reopened, a tower was still lacking. It was inaugurated ten years later, in 1825, and two years later its copper cladding was in place.  A second inauguration was held on 9 September 1827. In 1807, Dean Hall was built at the corner of Cross Street 22 and Vallgatan 28 after wall-builder Gottlieb Lindner's drawings.After the 1802 fire the old cemetery was converted into an open square, Kyrkotorget, and in 1822 the whole area around the church, and west to Western Hamnkanalen (which joined in the middle of the current Western Port Road, and was filled in 1903\u20131905) was paved with cobblestones. The name was changed in 1846 to Domkyrkoplatsen. The grounds around the church site were planted in 1851 and surrounded with iron fencing around 1860. The name was changed to Domkyrkoplanen in 1883. After completion, the church exterior was basically the one seen today, the major change being that the end walls of the tower's lateral extensions were demolished in 1832 and replaced by an iron railing. The cathedral's assessed value in 1889 was 500,000 Swedish kronor.\nIt is estimated that approximately 20,000 people have been buried in the church area, while 3,000 people were buried inside the church between 1635 and 1802. A plaque on the east side of the chancel recalls this use with the following text:\n\nDomkyrkoplanen has for centuries been a cemetery.Here rests the dust of twenty thousand dead.\nThe cathedral was the first church in Sweden to be fitted with central heating, which was installed in 1852 under the management of the English civil engineer Hadon. Gas lighting was installed in 1853. The church was insured in 1857 for fire with the Skandia Insurance Company for the sum of 500,000 Riksdaler.The church tower began to lean precariously to the southwest in the early 20th century, and the church and Domkyrkoplanen were shut down for an extended period for basic reinforcement. High Masses were held in the German Church and evensong and weekly church services in Landala chapel.A comprehensive restoration was carried out in 1904. The church received new flooring, new windows and doors, new benches and a new temperature management system. A further restoration in 1954\u20131957 included driving 313 concrete piles into the bedrock to stabilize the building.  In the years 1983\u20131985 there was another Renovation.\nUntil the late 1990s one could visit the cathedral tower and one of its eight small balconies using an elevator followed by a staircase of 151 steps. During installation of a new elevator in November 2013, the walls of the first cathedral were found 30 cm (11.81 in) underneath the floor.\n\n\n== Cathedral architecture ==\nThe present cathedral was designed in classical style and was larger than the two earlier buildings. It is now 59.4 metres long and 38 metres wide, including the new transept, which did not previously exist. The cattle and nave are 22.86 metres wide. The interior height of the nave is 14.25 metres excluding the tower, and 52.85 metres including the tower.An example of the classical style is the large main portal at the west end. It is framed by four doric columns on a pediment.\n\n\n=== Trim and interior ===\n\nThe interior shows elements of various styles, mainly classical and Empire style. The ionic pilasters on the cattle wall are classical. The pilasters are built of red marble with gold leaf at the top. The stands in the transept and the organ loft in the west are also classical.Emipire style is represented in the combination of white and gold leaves in many of the interior fittings, the glazed episcopal bench that is used today to chat to visitors and the clergy, the wall clock and the stands. Also in empire style is the pulpit, designed by the architect Axel Magnus Fahlcrantz.\nAngelic figures on the altar, on the other hand, represent a Baroque style because they belong to the ancient altar set from the 18th century. The figures were sculpted in 1752 by Jacques Adrien Masreliez, led by Carl H\u00e5rleman, and were salvaged from the fire.The old white, partly gold-plated grandfather clock in the Cathedral is from the 18th century and was saved from the 1802 fire. During the 1954\u20131957 restoration it was moved from its previous position by the southern long wall on King Street to the south-east transept wall at the entrance to the episcopal bench. The clock has a painted cover with gilded moldings that suit the style of other furnishings in the church. It was produced in 1751 in Gothenburg by watchmaker Olof Rising, who also made clocks. Gothenburg clock specialist Arthur Johnson refurbished the clock thoroughly in 1957, including the chimes. \n\n\n=== The organ ===\nThe current organ in the organ loft at the west end dates from 1962 but has maintained its original fa\u00e7ade of white and gold. (The previous organ was built by the Stockholm organ builder Olof Schwan (1744\u20131812), who was contracted on 3 August 1805 but died in 1812. The work was taken over by John Eberhard, and on 1 December 1816 the new organ was inaugurated.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Gothenburg Cathedral is the seat of the bishop of the diocese of Gothenburg in the Church of Sweden. The present cathedral is the third to be built on the same ground. It was built in 1815 and the style is Classical. The first one was built in 1633 and it was named Gustavi",
          "Immaculate inside with an even more impressive exterior, Gustavi Cathedral is certainly one of the more stunning churches in G\u00f6teborg. It\u2019s a must visit when in the city centre.",
          "We arrived at 7.30am on the 24th December to experience a very moving Christmas service in Swedish complete with a choir and candles.",
          "The Cathedral was not open when I visited, but it was a sunny, nice day and I enjoyed sitting in the courtyard-like area situated in the front. It is really a beautiful building and the plants in the courtyard area are well maintained and nice to sit around.",
          "This is a lovely peaceful place to stop awhile. It is fairly plain and white inside with golden decorations.",
          "A small cathedral compared to many however very attractive inside and I would imagine an excellent location for a wedding as well as normal services.",
          "It was quite peaceful visiting the church in the middle of the day. It's interiors are nice and clean and offer an insight to its history and design. The location is central and is easily accessible. Worth a visit.",
          "I was walking through the shopping precinct and came across this park with what looked like a tiny fronted memorial, but in fact was a church. It was free to go into and well worth a look. Clearly a music venue, they were setting up the altar for an evening event. Very modern,",
          "Highly recommendable to assist to the mass of Sunday at 11 hours. They have an amasing chorus of girls.",
          "Stopped by to just snap a picture, but ended up looking around and soaking it up. Small inside but very beautiful",
          "This church, with its tall tower rising high above the surrounding buildings, dominates the center of the old city. Green gardens and trees provide a quiet escape form the busy shopping district surrounding it. I noticed a sign for a children's choir performance in the evening",
          "Very striking, this church has burnt down & been rebuilt several times. Right in the centre it's impressive from the outside, the interior is plain but very light. Perhaps because it was a summer weekend but there seemed to be a lot of music both inside & out, we listened to a",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed a brief visit to this impressive church which is centrally located. Interior is in fine fettle",
          "Classical cathedral at the Goteborg city center - just visit it for 5 minutes , sit and enjoy silence , clean lines and organ.",
          "We didn't take any photos in this Cathedral in compliance with the 'No photos' sign. We were surprised at how calm and relaxing the interior appeared being painted largely in white with the odd gold covered embellishment.",
          "Cathedral of Gothenburg was founded in 1600s and last rebuilt in 1815. It is of neoclassical style and interior is enhanced with white, grey and gold colors. Worth stopping for a short visit.",
          "If you are strolling by and it is open then you should look inside. But it is nothing special - the Stockholm churches are more interesting architecturally.",
          "Beautiful church with a golden inside. Huge organ. Almost always open if you want to light a candle for someone. In Christmas times they do a small nativity scene and sometimes they have a live nativity scene outside, sometimes also with even a camel!",
          "Stumbled upon this while exploring the streets of Gothenburg. It's a nice church from the outside, although doesn't seem particularly old. I didn't go inside but I had a walk around the gardens which were colourful for this time of year. Surprisingly peaceful despite being",
          "I am not a snob but I didnt like it. I was expecting more for this landmark. don't get me wrong, it is nice but Goteborg has better looking churches around to reveal old architecture, Annedalskyrkan, Hagakyrkan, etc. It doesn't have the old feel. It is the Cathedral because is",
          "We had a short visit to the Gustavi Cathedral. A very nice and simple setting with a gorgeous altar. A typical Scandinavian church to us, but a very nice one.",
          "This is the cathedral for the entire bishopric. The inside is lovely. And the accoustics are phenomenal. They have a great music program and their acapela (sp) choir is outstanding. Check times for frequent free concerts at noon.",
          "We loved the white open clean feeling of this cathedral and the simple but elegant design inside. Outside it appears like an old building, but inside fresh and new. An uplifting place to worship in. Worthwhile to stop in and view as different from other older traditional",
          "The Gustavi Cathedral has a typical Scandinavian interior, which you don't expect seeing the outside. The building is absolutely worth a short visit. It shows also a little bit of the typical Swedish way of life.",
          "Built in 1633 and named after King Gustav II, its a wonderfully proportion cathedral you can spend an hour looking round.",
          "Step into the cathedral and be fascinated. Newly renovated, sacred and calm arises in this stripped down but very tasteful church building.Few but beautiful art installations.",
          "Church was founded in 1633 and named after king Gustav II. It was last rebuilt in 1815 after a fire. Earlier it was surrounded by cemetery, which is now converted to a park. There is a bust of Peter Wieselgren, a cathedral dean in the park. Bell tower has highest wt of bells in",
          "I have to admit that there is not much to see in this church, but it definitely has an amazing atmosphere and a lot of positive energy. I've never seen a church like this in my country, so I thought it is pretty amazing, though I can imagine that it wouldn't be anyhow special",
          "We wanted to visit this church because my grandfather was christened there in the 1800s. The church is beautiful and solemn. The Romanian beggars at the door were a reminder that Christ spoke of the poor more than anything else. It bugged me, but was poignant and where else",
          "We happened upon this cathedral by happenstance while walking around the shops in the area. It's beautiful and worth seeing if you're in the area, but it's not a destination spot to travel out of your way for.",
          "Not worth to visit. Go to Masthuggskyrkan instead. ;) I know it\u00b4s an important landmark, but it is my opinion.",
          "Fairly plain inside. After seeing some stunning cathedrals, this was a bit of a let down. Close to city centre so easy access if wanting to drop by.",
          "The Cathedral in G\u00f6teborg is located in the heart of the city. The current Cathedral was consecrated in 1815, it was built after the old one burnt down in 1802. Actually, it is the third to be built on the same spot, the first being consecrated in 1633. Architect Carl Wilhelm"

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum. On 29 December 2004, the Museum of World Culture opened near Korsv\u00e4gen. Museums include the Gothenburg Museum of Art, and several museums of sea and navigation history, natural history, the sciences, and East India. Aeroseum, close to the G\u00f6teborg City Airport, is an aircraft museum in a former military underground air force base. The Volvo museum has exhibits of the history of Volvo and the development from 1927 until today. Products shown include cars, trucks, marine engines, and buses.Universeum is a public science centre that opened in 2001, the largest of its kind in Scandinavia. It is divided into six sections, each containing experimental workshops and a collection of reptiles, fish, and insects. Universeum occasionally host debates between Swedish secondary-school students and Nobel Prize laureates or other scholars.\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThe most noted attraction is the amusement park Liseberg, located in the central part of the city. It is the largest amusement park in Scandinavia by number of rides, and was chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes. It is the most popular attraction in Sweden by number of visitors per year (more than 3 million).There are a number of independent theatre ensembles in the city, besides institutions such as Gothenburg City Theatre, Backa Theatre (youth theatre), and Folkteatern.The main boulevard is called Kungsportsavenyn (commonly known as Avenyn, \"The Avenue\"). It is about 1 km (0.6 mi) long and starts at G\u00f6taplatsen \u2013 which is the location of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, the city's theatre, and the city library, as well as the concert hall \u2013 and stretches all the way to Kungsportsplatsen in the old city centre of Gothenburg, crossing a canal and a small park. The Avenyn was created in the 1860s and 1870s as a result of an international architecture contest, and is the product of a period of extensive town planning and remodelling. Avenyn has Gothenburg's highest concentration of pubs and clubs. Gothenburg's largest shopping centre (8th largest in Sweden), Nordstan, is located in central Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg's Haga district is known for its picturesque wooden houses and its caf\u00e9s serving the well-known Haga bulle \u2013 a large cinnamon roll similar to the kanelbulle.Five Gothenburg restaurants have a star in the 2008 Michelin Guide: 28 +, Basement, Fond, Kock & Vin, Fiskekrogen, and Sj\u00f6magasinet.\nThe city has a number of star chefs \u2013 over the past decade, seven of the Swedish Chef of the Year awards have been won by people from Gothenburg.The Gustavus Adolphus pastry, eaten every 6 November in Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus Day, is especially connected to, and appreciated in, Gothenburg because the city was founded by King Gustavus Adolphus.One of Gothenburg's most popular natural tourist attractions is the southern Gothenburg archipelago, which is a set of several islands that can be reached by ferry boats mainly operating from Saltholmen. Within the archipelago are the \u00c4lvsborg fortress, Vinga and Styrs\u00f6 islands.\n\n\n=== Festivals and fairs ===\n\nThe annual Gothenburg Film Festival, is the largest film festival in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Book Fair, held each year in September.

Gothenburg also was the birthplace of the Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg. The first internationally successfully Swedish group, instrumental rock group The Spotnicks came from Gothenburg. Bands such as The Soundtrack of Our Lives and Ace of Base are well-known pop representatives of the city. During the 1970s, Gothenburg had strong roots in the Swedish progressive movement (progg) with such groups as Nationalteatern, Nynningen, and Motvind. The record company Nacksving and the editorial office for the magazine Musikens Makt which also were part of the progg movement was located in Gothenburg during this time as well. There is also an active indie scene in Gothenburg.

Another popular festival, Way Out West, focuses more on rock, electronic, and hip-hop genres.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nAs in all of Sweden, a variety of sports are followed, including football, ice hockey, basketball, handball, baseball, and figure skating. A varied amateur and professional sports clubs scene exists.Gothenburg is the birthplace of football in Sweden as the first football match in Sweden was played there in 1892. The city's three major football clubs, IFK G\u00f6teborg, \u00d6rgryte IS, and GAIS share a total of 34 Swedish championships between them. IFK has also won the UEFA Cup twice. Other notable clubs include BK H\u00e4cken (football), Pixbo Wallenstam IBK (floorball), multiple national handball champion Redbergslids IK, and four-time national ice hockey champion Fr\u00f6lunda HC, Gothenburg had a professional basketball team, Gothia Basket, until 2010 when it ceased. The bandy department of GAIS, GAIS Bandy, played the first season in the highest division Elitserien last season. The group stage match between the main rivals Sweden and Russia in the 2013 Bandy World Championship was played at Arena Heden in central Gothenburg.The city's most notable sports venues are Scandinavium, and Ullevi (multisport) and the newly built Gamla Ullevi (football).\nThe 2003 World Allround Speed Skating Championships were held in Rudhallen, Sweden's only indoor speed-skating arena. It is a part of Ruddalens IP, which also has a bandy field and several football fields.The only Swedish heavyweight champion of the world in boxing, Ingemar Johansson, who took the title from Floyd Paterson in 1959, was from Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg has hosted a number of international sporting events including the 1958 FIFA World Cup, the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, an NFL preseason game on 14 August 1988 between the Chicago Bears and the Minnesota Vikings, the 1992 European Football Championship, the 1993 and the 2002 World Men's Handball Championship, the 1995 World Championships in Athletics, the 1997 World Championships in Swimming (short track), the 2002 Ice Hockey World Championships, the 2004 UEFA Cup final, the 2006 European Championships in Athletics, and the 2008 World Figure Skating Championships.

Diving, swimming, synchronized swimming and open-water competitions were held on 28 July to 7 August. The water polo events were played on the neighboring city of Bor\u00e5s.Gothenburg is also home to the Gothenburg Sharks, a professional baseball team in the Elitserien division of baseball in Sweden.With around 25,000 sailboats and yachts scattered about the city, sailing is a popular sports activity in the region, particularly because of the nearby Gothenburg archipelago. In June 2015, the Volvo Ocean Race, professional sailing's leading crewed offshore race, concluded in Gothenburg, as well as an event in the 2015\u20132016 America's Cup World Series in August 2015.The Gothenburg Amateur Diving Club (G\u00f6teborgs amat\u00f6rdykarklubb) Has been operating since October 1938.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDue to Gothenburg's advantageous location in the centre of Scandinavia, trade and shipping have always played a major role in the city's economic history, and they continue to do so. Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies. The blue-collar industries which have dominated the city for long are still important factors in the city's economy, but they are being gradually replaced by high-tech industries.Banking and finance are also important, as well as the event and tourist industry.Gothenburg is the terminus of the Valdemar-G\u00f6teborg gas pipeline, which brings natural gas from the North Sea fields to Sweden, through Denmark.Historically, Gothenburg was home base from the 18th century of the Swedish East India Company. From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "We went nuts. The ride is crazy right from the start til the end. Its cool they have a game that we can download and play while we stand in line.

          "Great night in the park at the end of October the Halloween theme really was something else zombies and clowns roaming around ready to scare!! Park was really busy but there wasn't much queuing the coasters where the highlight.",
          "Had an amazing time at the park. Rides are awesome. Helix definitely wins. Halloween theme also made it even better.",
          "An excellent compact theme park in the centre of Gothenburg. Being slightly older than the typical clientele, we really appreciated this compact theme park as we didn't have to walk so far. Being older didn't stop us from taking on some of the faster rollercoasters. We had a lot",
          "First visit here when we were on a weekend trip . Park opened at 12 and closed at 9pm, Halloween theme was set up which was outstanding and probably better than Disney Paris . Hardly any queues and quality of rides was excellent, was able to leave the park and go back in . After",
          "There is no words to explain how great this park is. A lot of attractions for childs and adults. You just must to visit!",
          "Beautifully taken care of amusement park with all kind of rides for all ages. The rollercoasters here are one of the best I've taken. Don't miss out on the beautiful flower gardens on display. Somewhat expensive but overall worth the money spent. Several restaurants & caf\u00e9es so",
          "This amusement park is very close to the city centre. Many things to do here and for children its a paradise with roller coasters etc. You can pay only for entry instead of paying everywhere",
          "Always nice to visit Liseberg! It is a lot of different things to do there. For a couple you will probably be there 3-5 hours, But for a family with kids you can easily spend a whole day here.",
          "Lovely gardens. Option to pay only for entry instead of paying additional to go on the rides. Enjoyed a charcuterie board outside in the beer garden. Live music and dancing in an outdoor, covered pavilion.",
          "We had a lot of fun. Very good roller coasters, no long waiting (about 20 min for the most popular) . Absolutely worth the price !",
          "As the season was over, it was fewer people and almost no ques to the attractions so we enjoyed our favourite ones several times. Some attractions were closed before the closing time but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t find info about it beforehand",
          "The Liseberg park is said to be the largest in Scandinavia. It has a wide array of rides including a wooden rollercoaster. There are numerous restaurants and games on site. Well worth a visit!",
          "Ibhave been going here for years, but, when one goes with rhe family, I believe the entry fee for the adult is way too high. After all I go there and spend tons of money for my young ones, I am not interested in riding around. So I would gladly see a lower fee for parents. Anf",
          "Beautiful park, we visited in September so the queues were not that big. A concert was on when we visited and added to the atmosphere. The Ferris wheel is a must if you want a great view of the city. Only downside is you have to pay for entrance and then have to pay for rides.",
          "The rides were wild and fun. We went after dinner so there were few lines. Fun to see the city from the big Ferris wheel. Best part of park was winning giant candy bar at roulette wheel game. We had a big suitcase so we could get it home to North Carolina.",
          "Liseberg is located conveniently in the centre of the city. Parking is best done in the Focus house that seems less attacked by car thiefs which can be a problem on the south side. Best food in my mind is to avoid the burgers and fast food places and instead opt for the",
          "Took my two young children & couldn\u2019t be happier... It has the thrill rides of a massive theme park whilst still preserving the charm of a smaller old fashioned park. My children loved it & we will certainly be returning.",
          "Not the cheapest place to visit. Great rides though. I'd say better than Alton Towers! The rides were great fun really enjoyed the day. Log flume and rapids two water rides to cool down on a hot day. Nice bar inside the park which served the 'big' beers. Queues weren't that bad",
          "Quite big amusement park full of interesting rides full of adrenaline rush. The rides are big and massive and offer great rides not for the faint hearten. Large selection of food courts.",
          "Good for children and adults! Just by All-in-one ticket to enter and have unlimited number of rides experience. I was there on Friday when park was open at 15-00 (you should check if park open that day when you want to visit it). Two times I was waiting for 10-15 minutes and one",
          "My friend and I (21-22yo girls) went to Liseberg on a nice and sunny day at noon in August and got the \"all in one\" tickets! Our goal was to go through all the scary rides - and it was great fun! The rides felt quite safe, queue times were mostly short, except for maybe a couple",
          "We never got here. We booked a trip to Gothenburg with kids only to find it closed for the next three days. Our fault for presuming it would be open in August on a Monday.",
          "The best amusement park in Sweden! it was a great day in Liseberg! you will love it! Don't forget to ride Helix",
          "Although I don't take any of the rides due to mobility issues, this place looks as though it is so much fun. More impressive than either Tivoli in Copenhagen or Grona Lund in Stockholm. I can only say that I wish I was young and fit. Free entry with the Gothenburg Pass.",
          "We pre bought our wristbands on line on the Swedish site to get free express passes as only visiting for the day ( don\u2019t use the English website as you then can\u2019t do this) The park is really compact but there are loads of rides to suit all ages from a kids section to thrills and",
          "Some great rollercoasters here. Very little queues as we got there at 11.00. not cheap but a good day out.",
          "One of the most fun amusement parks I've been to so far. Just a really great and fun amusement park! It\u2019s also really near Gothia Towers as well so if you\u2019re staying there then it\u2019s just a short walk to Liseberg. Great roller coasters where you felt safe sitting in them. I",
          "We had a full 12 hour day at Liseberg in July 2019 with our 6 and 8 year old. Liseberg is nice, clean and not over crowded. Our 6 year old really enjoyed the are for the smaller children, and my 8 year old did all the roller coasters. Even though the weather was not the best, we",
          "We spent half a day here, a family of 3 children (4,8,10). You need to understand their hight limits. They vary if the children are accompanied by an adult or they go alone. So take care to check it. Our favorite ride was the ping pong. Not for the faint of heart! The only",
          "When we come \"home\" to visit, Liseberg is a must. It's a esthetically nice looking park, and the rides are fantastic. They are more intence and well thought out than most anywhere else. Helix, the new ride Valkyria, and Atmosfear are among my favorites. The Tyrolia restaurant",
          "100% recommend for families, great and thrilling rides of high quality. Valkyria has a n amazing drop, breathtaking. Helix is an awesome rollercoaster. Good service at the start. Somewhat long ques to rides but all worth it. App is great for monitoring ques. Could almost not get",
          "Something for everyone and a lot of option. Helix is just the best. Buy tickets online and get 4 express tickets",
          "What else can I say this amusement park seems to get better and better with every visit even though it looked like long queues they really know how to shift the queues. Atmosphere is electric and great staff this visit I got to meet Pontus such a credit to Liseberg and treated",
          "Great rides but the hour plus queues are ridiculous. Go in quieter periods of the year to get more in.",
          "Even tho they knew that most of the attractions where out of order they didn't say anything on entering the park. A huge waste of time and money.",
          "Absolutely loved our afternoon here. Rides are awesome and definitely got the Adrenalin going. Easy to find, well priced and at the time we went the lines were minimal. Also the snack food was well priced.",
          "Summer time and it was super hot weather this year. Need to bring a lot of water in this park. Although they have fountain/drinking water in many places. Kaninland is perfect for my 3 years okd daughter. She really had a great time. We been here for 2 days and she loves it. The",
          "Amazing park. Lots of great rides from top notch rollercoasters to well themed kiddie rides and everything inbetween. Helix was a standout highlight. Operations were very smooth with even the busiest coasters managing a high throughput and keeping queue times lower than would",
          "We had a lot of fun. Park had more rides than expected and tons of places to eat offering different types of food cuisine and experiences.",
          "Go go go! Good fun with friends. The Fem Camp, (five game camp??) is good fun for a few couples to duke it out. Make sure that you spin a few wheels for a giant candy bar!!",
          "I went to Lisebeg on Wednesday with my fiancees 15 year old son and a few friends. We were excited to go there,upon arrival at 11.30 we were greeted with a 30 +minute queue to pay into the entrance ,Acceptable given the park had just opened and the month being july. Almost \u20ac100",
          "Bought two-day tickets but regretted it since queues were over an hour for everything so we had given up and gone home by mid afternoon on the second day. Hard to imagine a worse place to be than here on a normal to busy day - barely room to move - and sometimes hard to",
          "Lots of exciting rides. A Lot of waitingtime though. Food at fair prices compared to other amusement parks. Easy to park close by. A great place for a Nice family day",
          "We visit Liseberg every time we are in Gothenburg . All the family like it. Ok it's crowded but it's so nice amusement park.",
          "Visited on a week day during Gothia Cup. Fabulous rides but very busy. Queues were large with no option to purchase fast passes so didn\u2019t stay longer than a few hours.",
          "You can spend 2 days easily at this park . One day playing and riding and the other day queuing !! Yes !!! The longest queue lines I\u2019ve ever seen in a park !! But it was fun over all Piece of advise pay more and get the fast track option but be careful its timed framed !!",

          "The park is really fun, great roller coaster, I had only half day to spend there with my family, and could get into reasonable number of rides although it was Sunday. The waiting time was very reasonable even for popular rides. It was rainy day but it did not affect us much. We",

          "This is like a miniature version of a Six Flags amusement park in the States. The roller coasters were fast, thrilling and fun. The carnival games mainly consisted of a roulette wheel and you pay 20kr for a block of 5 consecutive numbers. If the wheel stops on one of your",

          "This amusement park has not changed much in the last 20 years or so since I\u2019ve been here. Part of the park is on top of the hill with spectacular views of the city. It\u2019s easy to get to by car and public transportation.",
          "This amusement park has everything. For small children, and for \"sherpa\"-grannies, only carrying bags. Great rollercoasters and other amusing facilities, as well as great restaurantes, even a \"Austrian beer garden\". And best of all, they who won't ride the rollercoasters,",
          "I have been visiting Liseberg annually since I was a very small child in 1996, and I seem to never stop loving it. As a an enthusiast for world-class roller-coasters and sufficient amounts of adrenaline, it is an amusement park that absolutely delivers, each and every time for",
          "Compact and clean !! Separate section for kids. Huge roller coasters for the strong hearted. Only wish there were a few more food stalls around. Too many stalls to try and win huge bars of chocolates ! Overall a great experience if you visit with family and children.",

          "Europes best park. Expensive as fcuk to eat but still highly recomended. Helix is a scary one. Dont forget to try the Atmosfear. Remember to have an extra pair of pants for that one",
          "Went there on a Saturday, rainy day, park too crowded, too expensive even to enter, not enough places to sit, and pretty mind boggling because of the rides which seemed so dangerous. Also there was nothing much for the tween group, my kids are 8 and 11, and the one section",
          "Great rides and decent food. Had some problem with the lunch order, got the wrong food, but it didnt bother me that much. The rides are great and varied.",
          "We went there on a friday when it seemed all of sweden and norway had a day off. The park was too crowded and i can not believe the security was well maintained because of this. Too long wait times for rides. Food tasted really bad, took a long time to get and when we got the",

          "Weather was a bit cloudy and thus we decided to visit Liseberg. We read among critics that the main issue was the waiting time... the parc is beautiful, its not huge but there are plenty attractions for everybody... cute area for kids and great area for adults... we spent 6",

          "I was amazed to see how well done everything was for Halloween at Liseberg. We really enjoyed it!!! We went twice in Halloween week - and that was good because during week days there are less people in lines to the scary houses. On last Saturday it was crowded with people and",

          "We went to the amusement park on a sunny day when many people had taken the day of, so it was very crowded. Way to crowdy for the capacity of the place. As recommended, we had bought tickets online, which got ut relatively fast into the park, but in order to get our travellers",

          "I took my 10 yr. old son here a couple of days after Christmas and it was incredibly beautiful. There is so much to do there, but the biggest deal to me was the giant Ferris wheel we rode as I am terrified of heights. It was a bit frightening, just because we were up so high,",

          "This is a cool place and a good example of Swedish culture. If you make it there try to catch the ice show (if still on) and have the waffles. The best time is if you have some snow, but be careful to dress warm since the walking might impose some extra cold factor over the",
          "First time we went to this park by Paddan. It was very interesting arriving hete by this mode. We walked around this lovely park and we had nice time here. You can find attractions for adults and children as well so it is a good programme for everybody. Don't miss the",

          "All the Christmas ambience was great but get ready to fork some serious money either for the all-pas or for the single rides. It is way better to go by public transport as parking is expensive as well. Kids love it but wallets don't.",

          "I went herd with my daughters. As it was Saturday night it was very busy but had s safe and friendly atmosphere we took the pagan boat ride to the market from the centre of Gothenburg. It advertises blankets but we didn't get offered any so wrap up warmly as it's a chilly ride.",
          "Wow, the theme park Liseberg is dressed in winter/Christmas/snow every December. The artificial snow seems very real, so many lamps on the trees etc. Some stalls where you can buy food, gl\u00f6gg (the spicy wine) and Swedish and non-Swedish products. Some rides are open but the",

          "Ok, I'll admit that as a 40-something male, maybe this isn't the right place for me. But I can't help feeling disappointed by how average this park is: we visited on a Saturday at lunchtime in December, during the Christmas season. There was no magic, the Christmas statues and",

          "Visited Liseberg today with my wife and my Swedish relatives. We had decided to come to Sweden from the United States to see what Christmas was like in Sweden. Boy, did Liseberg provide the answer. The lights, music, and shops take your breath away. There were far more shops",
          "If you are visiting around Christmas time be prepared for some major crowd! It is beautiful, charming and romantic but with addition of half of G\u00f6teburg. There are peoole standing in queues infront all major attractions. Prices are quite high. But still it is beautiful to visit.",
          "Walk about 25 minutes from the centre of Gothenburg and Liseberg appears before you in all its sparkling glory. It's not massive but it's so beautiful especially as the darkness falls and the lights take centre stage. Cost 100 sek per adult and then coupons for the rides which",

        "wiki": "Stephen Robert Irwin (22 February 1962 \u2013 4 September 2006), nicknamed \"The Crocodile Hunter\", was an Australian zookeeper, television personality, wildlife expert, environmentalist and conservationist.\nIrwin achieved worldwide fame from the television series The Crocodile Hunter (1996\u20132007), an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series which he co-hosted with his wife Terri. Together, the couple also hosted the series Croc Files (1999\u20132001), The Crocodile Hunter Diaries (2002\u20132006), and New Breed Vets (2005). They also co-owned and operated Australia Zoo, founded by Irwin's parents in Beerwah, about 80 kilometres (50 mi) north of the Queensland state capital city of Brisbane.\nIrwin died on 4 September 2006, after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. His death became international news and was met with expressions of shock and grief by fans, the media, governments, non-profit organizations, and other celebrities. Numerous parks, zoos, streets, and an asteroid have been named in his honor. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society named its island-class patrol vessel MY Steve Irwin after Irwin. His widow Terri Irwin, with whom he had two children, continues to operate Australia Zoo.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIrwin was born on his mother's birthday to Lyn and Bob Irwin in Upper Ferntree Gully, a suburb of Melbourne. He was of Irish descent on his father's side. He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School. Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a wildlife rehabilitator. After moving to Queensland, Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve grew up around crocodiles and other reptiles.\nIrwin became involved with the park in a number of ways, including taking part in daily animal feeding, as well as care and maintenance activities. On his sixth birthday, he was given a 12-foot (4 m) scrub python. He began handling crocodiles at the age of nine after his father had educated him on reptiles from an early age. Also at age nine, he wrestled his first crocodile, again under his father's supervision. He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast Crocodile Management program and captured over 100 crocodiles, some of which were relocated, while others were housed at the family park. Irwin took over the management of the park in 1991 and renamed it Australia Zoo in 1998.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Marriage and family ===\n\nIn 1991, Irwin met Terri Raines, an American naturalist from Eugene, Oregon, who was visiting wildlife rehabilitation facilities in Australia and had decided to visit the zoo. According to the couple, it was love at first sight. Terri said at the time, \"I thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world. He sounded like an environmental Tarzan, a larger-than-life superhero guy.\" They were engaged four months later and were married in Eugene on 4 June 1992. Together they had two children: a daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin (born 24 July 1998), and a son, Robert Clarence (named after Irwin's father) Irwin (born 1 December 2003). Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a saltwater crocodile, and Sui, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as \"the reason [he] was put on the Earth.\" His wife once said, \"The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more.\" Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear wedding rings; they believed that in their line of work, wearing jewellery could pose a hazard to them and/or the animals.\n\n\n=== The Crocodile Hunter and related work ===\n\nSteve and Terri spent their honeymoon trapping crocodiles together. Film footage of their honeymoon, taken by John Stainton, became the first episode of The Crocodile Hunter. The series debuted on Australian TV screens in 1996 and made its way onto North American television the following year. The Crocodile Hunter became successful in the United States, the UK, and over 130 other countries, reaching 500 million people. Irwin's exuberant and enthusiastic presenting style, broad Australian accent, signature khaki shorts, and catchphrase \"Crikey!\" became known worldwide. Sir David Attenborough praised Irwin for introducing many to the natural world, saying \"He taught them how wonderful and exciting it was. He was a born communicator.\"American satellite and cable television channel Animal Planet ended The Crocodile Hunter with a series finale titled \"Steve's Last Adventure.\" The last Crocodile Hunter documentary spanned three hours with footage of Irwin's across-the-world adventure in locations including the Himalayas, the Yangtze River, Borneo, and the Kruger National Park. Irwin went on to star in other Animal Planet documentaries, including Croc Files, The Crocodile Hunter Diaries, and New Breed Vets. During a January 2006 interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Irwin announced that Discovery Kids would be developing a show for his daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin \u2013 a plan realised after his death as the series Bindi the Jungle Girl.\n\n\n=== Other television and film work ===\nIn 1998, Irwin continued, working with director Mark Strickson, to present The Ten Deadliest Snakes in the World. He appeared on several episodes of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. A 2000 FedEx commercial with Irwin lightheartedly dealt with the possibility of occupational death from snakebite and the fanciful notion that FedEx would have saved him, if only FedEx were used.Under Irwin's leadership, the operations grew to include the zoo, the television series, the Steve Irwin Conservation Foundation (later renamed Wildlife Warriors), and the International Crocodile Rescue. Improvements to the Australia Zoo include the Animal Planet Crocoseum, the rainforest aviary and Tiger Temple. Irwin mentioned that he was considering opening an Australia Zoo in Las Vegas, Nevada, and possibly at other sites around the world.In 2001, Irwin appeared in a cameo role in the Eddie Murphy film Dr. Dolittle 2, in which an alligator warns Dolittle that he knows Irwin is going to grab him and is prepared to attack when he does, but Dolittle fails to warn Irwin in time. Irwin's only starring feature film role was in 2002's The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which was released to mixed reviews. In the film Irwin (who portrayed himself and performed numerous stunts) mistakes some CIA agents for poachers. He sets out to stop them from capturing a crocodile, which, unknown to him, has actually swallowed a tracking transmitter. The film won the Best Family Feature Film award for a comedy film at the Young Artist Awards. The film was produced on a budget of about US$12 million, and has grossed $33 million. To promote the film, Irwin was featured in an animated short produced by Animax Entertainment for Intermix.In 2002, Irwin and his family appeared in the Wiggles video/DVD release Wiggly Safari, which was set in Australia Zoo and featured singing and dancing inspired by Australian wildlife. Irwin fronted an advertising campaign for The Ghan in 2003, a passenger train operating between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin. A Pacific National NR class locomotive was named Steve Irwin as part of the campaign. Irwin provided his voice for the 2006 animated film Happy Feet, as an elephant seal named Trev. The film was dedicated to Irwin, as he died during post-production. Another, previously incomplete scene, featuring Irwin providing the voice of an albatross and essentially playing himself, was restored to the DVD release.\n\n\n=== Media campaigns ===\n\nIrwin was also involved in several media campaigns. He enthusiastically joined with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to promote Australia's strict quarantine/customs requirements, with advertisements and posters featuring slogans such as, \"Quarantine Matters! Don't muck with it\". His payments for these advertising campaigns were directed into his wildlife fund.In 2004, Irwin was appointed ambassador for The Ghan, the passenger train running from Adelaide to Alice Springs in the central Australian outback, when the line was extended all the way to Darwin on the northern coast that year. For some time he was sponsored by Toyota.Irwin was a keen promoter for Australian tourism in general and Queensland tourism in particular. In 2002, the Australia Zoo was voted Queensland's top tourist attraction. His immense popularity in the United States meant he often promoted Australia as a tourist destination there. As a part of the United States' \"Australia Week\" celebrations in January 2006, Irwin appeared at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n=== Search and rescue in Mexico ===\nIn November 2003, Irwin was filming a documentary on sea lions off the coast of Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On the second day of the search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1997, while on a fishing trip on the coast of Queensland with his father, Irwin discovered a new species of turtle. Later given the honour of naming the newly discovered species, he named it Irwin's turtle (Elseya irwini) after his family. Another newly discovered Australian animal \u2013 a species of air-breathing land snail, Crikey steveirwini, was named after Irwin in 2009.Irwin was awarded the Centenary Medal by the Australian government in 2001 for his \"service to global conservation and to Australian tourism\". In 2004, he was recognised as Tourism Export of the Year. He was also nominated in 2004 for Australian of the Year but it was awarded to Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh, while Irwin was named 2004 Queensland Australian of the Year. Shortly before his death, Irwin was to be named an adjunct professor at the University of Queensland's School of Integrative Biology. On 14 November 2007, Irwin was awarded the adjunct professorship posthumously. In 2007, Irwin was posthumously inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.In May 2007, the government of Rwanda announced that it would name a baby gorilla after Irwin as a tribute to his work in wildlife conservation. Also in 2007, the state government of Kerala, India named the Crocodile Rehabilitation and Research Centre at Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary in his honour; however, Terri objected that this action had been taken without her permission and asked the Kerala government in 2009 to stop using Irwin's name and images \u2013 a request with which the state government complied in mid-2009.Irwin was inducted in 2009 into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame, recognised for international entrepreneurship both in business and wildlife conservation, significantly contributing to Queensland and its international reputation and in 2015, Irwin was a posthumous recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards. In 2017 it was announced that Irwin would be posthumously honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star was unveiled 26 April 2018. On 22 February 2019, the 57th anniversary of Irwin's birth, the search engine Google released a Google Doodle commemorating him, in the form of a slideshow.\n\n\n== Environmentalism ==\n\nIrwin was a passionate conservationist and believed in promoting environmentalism by sharing his excitement about the natural world rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation to be the most important part of his work: \"I consider myself a wildlife warrior. My mission is to save the world's endangered species.\" Irwin bought \"large tracts of land\" in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as \"like national parks\" and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.Irwin founded the Steve Irwin Conservation Foundation, which became an independent charity and was later renamed \"Wildlife Warriors Worldwide\". He also helped found International Crocodile Rescue, the Lyn Irwin Memorial Fund (named in memory of his mother, who died in an automobile crash in 2000), and the Iron Bark Station Wildlife Rehabilitation Facility.Irwin urged people to take part in considerate tourism and not support illegal poaching through the purchase of items such as turtle shells or shark-fin soup.Sir David Attenborough was an inspiration to Irwin, according to his widow. When presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award to Attenborough after Irwin's death at the British National Television Awards on 31 October 2006, Terri Irwin said, \"If there's one person who directly inspired my husband it's the person being honoured tonight.... [Steve's] real, true love was conservation \u2013 and the influence of tonight's recipient in preserving the natural world has been immense.\" Attenborough reciprocated by praising Irwin for introducing many to the natural world, saying, \"He taught them how wonderful and exciting it was, he was a born communicator.\"Irwin, after his death, was described by Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland, as a \"modern-day Noah.\" British naturalist David Bellamy lauded his skills as a natural historian and media performer. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki paid tribute to Irwin, noting that \"[h]umanity will not protect that which we fear or do not understand. Steve Irwin helped us understand those things that many people thought were a nuisance at best, a horror at worst. That made him a great educator and conservationist.\"After his death, the vessel MV Robert Hunter owned by the environmental action group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was renamed MY Steve Irwin. Shortly before his death, Irwin had been investigating joining Sea Shepherd's 2007\u20132008 voyage to Antarctica to disrupt Japanese whaling activity. Following his death, the organisation suggested renaming their vessel, and this idea was endorsed by Terri Irwin. Regarding the ship and its new name, Terri said, \"If Steve were alive, he'd be aboard with them!\"\n\n\n== Sporting activities ==\nIrwin loved mixed martial arts competitions and trained with Greg Jackson in the fighting/grappling system of Gaidojutsu.Like many Australians, he was an avid cricket fan. This was seen during his visit to Sri Lanka where he played cricket with some local children and said \"I love cricket\" and \"It's a shame we have to go catch some snakes now\". This was seen during the Crocodile Hunter episode \"Island of the Snakes\".Having grown up in Essendon, Irwin was a fan of the Essendon Bombers, an Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League. Irwin took part in an Australian Rules football promotion in Los Angeles as part of \"Australia Week\" in early 2006. After his death, a picture of Irwin wearing a Bombers guernsey was shown by ESPN.com in their Bottom 10 ranking of the worst Division I FBS college football teams after Week 1 of the season in tribute to him.Having lived in Queensland most of his life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult he was known to be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was involved with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nA controversial incident occurred during a public show on 2 January 2004, when Irwin carried his one-month-old son, Robert, in his arm while hand-feeding a chicken carcass to Murray, a 3.8-metre (12 ft 6 in) saltwater crocodile. The infant was close to the crocodile, and comparisons were made in the press to Michael Jackson's dangling his son outside a German hotel window. In addition, some child welfare groups, animal rights groups, and some of Irwin's television viewers criticised his actions as irresponsible and tantamount to child abuse. Irwin apologised on the US NBC show Today. Both he and his wife publicly stated that Irwin was in complete control of the situation, as he had dealt with crocodiles since he was a small child, and based on his lifetime of experience neither he nor his son was in any danger. He also showed footage of the event shot from a different angle, demonstrating that they were much farther from the crocodile than they had appeared in the publicised clip. Terri Irwin said their child was in no more danger than one being taught to swim. No charges were filed; according to one journalist, Irwin told officials he would not repeat the action. The incident prompted the Queensland government to change its crocodile-handling laws, banning children and untrained adults from entering crocodile enclosures.In June 2004, allegations were made that he disturbed wildlife (namely whales, seals and penguins) while filming a documentary, Ice Breaker, in Antarctica. The matter was subsequently closed without charges being laid.After questions arose in 2003 about Irwin being paid $175,000 worth of taxpayers' money to appear in a television advertisement and his possible political ties, Irwin told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he was a conservationist and did not choose sides in politics. His comments describing Australian Prime Minister John Howard as the \"greatest leader in the world\" earned him scorn in the media.Irwin was criticised for having an unsophisticated view of conservation in Australia that seemed more linked to tourism than to the problems Australia faces as a continent. In response to questions of Australia's problems with overgrazing, salinity, and erosion, Irwin responded, \"Cows have been on our land for so long that Australia has evolved to handle those big animals.\" The Sydney Morning Herald concluded with the opinion that his message was confusing and amounted to \"eating roos and crocs is bad for tourism, and therefore more cruel than eating other animals\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nIrwin died on 4 September 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The stinger penetrated his thoracic wall, causing massive trauma.  He was at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, taking part in the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television program.\nWhile swimming in chest-deep water, Irwin approached a short-tail stingray with an approximate span of two metres (6.5 ft) from the rear, in order to film it swimming away.\nAccording to the incident's only witness, \"All of a sudden [the stingray] propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail. Hundreds of strikes in a few seconds\". Irwin initially believed he only had a punctured lung. However, the stingray's barb pierced his heart, causing him to bleed to death. The stingray's behaviour appeared to have been a defensive response to being boxed in. Crew members aboard Irwin's boat administered CPR and rushed him to the nearby Low Isles where medical staff pronounced him dead.Irwin's death is believed to be the only fatality from a stingray captured on video.Footage of the incident was viewed by Queensland state police as part of their mandatory investigations. All copies of the footage were then destroyed at the behest of Irwin's family. Production was completed on Ocean's Deadliest, which was broadcast in the US on the Discovery Channel on 21 January 2007. The documentary was completed with footage shot in the weeks following the accident, but without including any mention of Irwin's accidental death.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nNews of Irwin's death prompted reactions around the world. Then\u2013Prime Minister John Howard expressed \"shock and distress\" at the death, saying that \"Australia has lost a wonderful and colourful son.\" Queensland's then-Premier Peter Beattie remarked that Irwin would \"be remembered as not just a great Queenslander, but a great Australian\". The Australian federal parliament opened on 5 September 2006 with condolence speeches by both Howard and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. Flags at the Sydney Harbour Bridge were lowered to half mast in honour of Irwin. In the days following Irwin's death, reactions dominated Australian online news sources, talk-back radio programs, and television networks. In the United States, where Irwin had appeared in over 200 Discovery Network television programs, special tributes appeared on the Animal Planet channel, as well as on CNN and major TV talk shows. Thousands of Irwin's fans visited Australia Zoo after his death, paying their respects and bringing flowers, candles, stuffed animals and messages of support.Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., called Irwin \"a remarkable individual\". Describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, \"I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about.\"In the weeks following Irwin's death, at least ten stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation as to whether they might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that \"We just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution. That's the last thing Steve would want.\"\n\n\n=== Funeral and memorial services ===\n\nFamily and friends of Irwin held a private funeral service in Caloundra on 9 September 2006. Irwin was buried in a private ceremony at Australia Zoo later that same day; the grave site is inaccessible to the zoo's visitors. Prime Minister Howard and Queensland Premier Beattie had offered to hold a state funeral, but Irwin's family decided this would not be appropriate and\u2014in the words of his father\u2014he would have preferred to be remembered as an \"ordinary bloke\".On 20 September, a public memorial service, introduced by Russell Crowe, was held in Australia Zoo's 5,500-seat Crocoseum; this service was broadcast live throughout Australia, the United States, the UK, Germany, and Asia, and it is estimated to have been seen by over 300 million viewers worldwide. The memorial included remarks by Prime Minister Howard; Irwin's father Bob and daughter Bindi; his associates Wes Mannion and John Stainton; and celebrities from Australia and around the world. Anthony Field of The Wiggles partly hosted the service, often sharing the screen with various animals, from koalas to elephants. Australian music star John Williamson sang \"True Blue\", which was Irwin's favourite song. In a symbolic finish to the service, Irwin's truck was loaded up with gear and driven out of the arena for the last time as Williamson sang. As a final tribute, Australia Zoo staff spelled out Irwin's catchphrase \"Crikey\" in yellow flowers as Irwin's truck was driven from the Crocoseum for the last time to end the service.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nOn 1 January 2007, Glass House Mountains Road, the road that runs by the Australia Zoo, was officially renamed Steve Irwin Way. Later that year the Australian government announced that a 135,000-hectare (334,000-acre) national park was being created in northern Queensland and would be named the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve. An asteroid discovered in 2001 has been named 57567 Crikey, in honour of Irwin and his \"signature phrase\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nGerald Durrell \u2013 British naturalist, zookeeper, author and television presenter\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at Australia Zoo\n\"Steve 'The Crocodile Hunter' Irwin \u2013 slideshow by Life magazine\".

Belonging to the Gothenburg Oscar Fredrik Parish of the Church of Sweden, it was opened on Easter Sunday 1893. The style is Neo Gothic, but the influence is not the Nordic gothic style but rather the style one can find in the large cathedrals down in continental Europe. The church and the parish got its name from king Oscar II (Oscar Fredrik being his full name).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Oscar Fredriks kyrka at Wikimedia Commons",

It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies.

From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "Everytime I visit this place, I am equally amused by the fishes swimming calmly in the aquarium and that I could go one floor above to look at the magnificent historical ships and models on display. I bring all my guests here and it never fails to impress them too.",

        "wiki": "The National Museum of World Culture (Swedish: V\u00e4rldskulturmuseet) opened in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2004. It is a part of the public authority Swedish National Museums of World Cultures and builds on the collections of the former G\u00f6teborgs Etnografiska Museum that closed down in the year 2000. Its aim is to interpret the subject of world culture in an interdisciplinary way. The museum is situated next to the Universeum science centre and the amusement park Liseberg, and close to Korsv\u00e4gen. \n\"The museum interprets the concept of world culture in a dynamic and open-ended manner. On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike. On the other hand, local, national, ethnic and gender differences are shaping much of that process. World culture is not only about communication, reciprocity, and interdependence, but the specificity, concretion and uniqueness of each and every individual.\" (From the background info on the museums homepage.)\nThe opening exhibitions of the museum were:\n\nNo Name Fever: AIDS in the age of globalization\nHorizons: Voices from a global Africa\nSister of Dreams: People and myths of the Orinoco\nFred Wilson: Site unseen - Dwellings of the Demons\n390 m2 Spirituality\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe cement and glass building, located on a slope leading up to the Liseberg amusement park, is graceful, compact and modernistic. Its four-storey glass atrium looks out on mountains and woods.The exhibition halls are in the closed part of the building, facing S\u00f6dra v\u00e4gen road. The upper storeys hang freely 5 m (16 ft) over a footpath. A 43 m (141 ft) long section of a display window provides passers-by with a view straight into the largest exhibition hall.The architects behind the museum, who were chosen after an international competition, were the French-Cuban-English couple C\u00e9cile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez of Brisac Gonzalez Architects.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn February 2005 the museum decided to remove the painting \"Sc\u00e8ne d'Amour\" by Louzla Darabi. The painting was part of a temporary exhibition about HIV/AIDS, and depicted a man and a woman having sexual intercourse. The artist and the curator had received numerous death threats from Muslims saddened and frustrated over the Koran quotations which were featured in a corner of the painting. Some threats were telling the artist to \"learn from the Netherlands\", referring to the murder of van Gogh and threats against Hirsi Ali.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Museum of World Culture\nBrisac Gonzalez Architects\nVirtual Collection of Masterpieces",

          "Such a poor museum that I wouldn't even call it a museum.",
          "It's more a playground than a museum. They should provide more accessible information so you can learn more as the topics are really relevant.",
          "This is a must if you are in Gothenburg. Its free to visit and you have a lot of exhibits. It\u2019s not your regular museum with historical paintings etc. they put a twist on it :)",

          "Intense experience in the adult sections, fun and energized space for children that is also easy for adults to enjoy. The temporary exibit was about feathers and birds and was dynamic.",
          "Despite it clearly being no sort of fire or other risk, due to the amount of space. We were not allowed to have our sleeping child in a pushchair next to our table in the restaurant. We had to sit downstairs and both my partner, who is \u2026",
          "A beautiful and deeply important place. A place that leaves you both happy, because you learn about the cultures of the world, but also very sad and troubled as you learn about the death and torment caused by differences in culture. Worth a visit!",

          "Interesting exhibits from different places. Cultural artefacts in all shapes and sizes. Seems like a good place to take kids too. There is like an indoor playground where kids can run around and explore. Completely free, so it's not the \u2026",
          "Nice place for  meetings as well! We used the lunch break for visiting the exhibition.",

          "Nice museum to spend some time on a rainy day. The exhibitions were very interesting but floor 3 was turned into a kids' play area, good for families but not the lone traveller. Also floor 1 was partially closed and not finished. At other times would be a very good museum though.",

          "I liked the humans section \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Nice place for young kids to play om floor 0, Perfekt for our 1 year old daughter. The shark tank is of course exiting as well. In the Rain forest it is a good idea to get rid of some heavy clothes as jackets before entering since it is really hot and humide.",
          "Free entrance! Interesting exhibitions on cultures, often thought provoking, sometimes a bit dull. Not at all as crowded as it could be. It has a caf\u00e9 as well. Kid friendly, elevators, big spaces. Right now the exhibition \"Tillsammans\" is very popular with the kids",

          "Truly inclusive",

          "Not so much for tourists as much as for locals. Really a wonderful resource if you have time for a day in nature. Nothing wild, no moose or bear, just to be clear, but a extremely well kept public area, fully immersed in Swedish nature. Great walking, running or mountain biking",

        "wiki": "The Gothenburg congestion tax (Swedish: Tr\u00e4ngselskatt i G\u00f6teborg), also referred to as the Gothenburg congestion charge, is a congestion pricing system implemented as a tax levied on most vehicles entering and exiting central Gothenburg, Sweden, including some main roads passing by the city. The congestion tax was introduced on January 1, 2013, with the Stockholm congestion tax as a model.\nThe primary purpose of the congestion tax is to reduce traffic congestion and improve the environmental situation in central Gothenburg, and to get financing for large road and rail construction projects in and around Gothenburg. The largest such project is V\u00e4stl\u00e4nken.\n\n\n== Affected area ==\nThe congestion tax area encompasses essentially the entire Gothenburg City Centre and the E6 main road passing the city. Curiously, cars passing the city are also taxed, providing no incentive to drive around the city rather than through the city, contrary to most other congestion charge schemes in the world. As an example in Stockholm, only vehicles entering and exiting the central city are taxed, not those passing by the city on the main highway. In Stockholm, there is no need to tax people driving creative detours.\nThere are unmanned electronic control points (in Swedish: betalstation, literally payment station) at all entrances to this area. The congestion tax is applied when passing stations in both directions. There is also a control point on the west of the city on \u00c4lvsborgsbron, far from the main congestion charge zone, which is perhaps odd since neither side of the bridge is within a charging zone. The effect of placing a control point here effectively means that any vehicle wishing to drive along the west coast of Sweden past Gothenburg must pay the congestion charge, with the shortest detour to avoid the charge adding 45 km to a journey, via Partille.\n\n\n== Amount of tax to pay ==\n\nThe amount of tax payable depends on what time of the day a motorist enters or exits the congestion tax area. There is no charge on Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays or the day before public holidays, nor during nights (18:30 \u2013 05:59), nor during the month of July.\n\nThe maximum amount of tax per vehicle per day is 60 SEK (6.40 Euro, 7.70  USD). 22 SEK is around 2.35 Euro or 2.80 USD.If a vehicle passes two stations within one hour, only the higher tax is paid.\nSome vehicles are exempt from tax, although notably environmentally friendly vehicles (mainly electric or natural gas or ethanol fuelled) must still pay.\nForeign registered vehicles were exempt until 2014 mainly for practical reasons, hard to get access to foreign car registers, and to claim payment from foreigners. But they are included now because of objections from companies about unfair taxation, and because the \"Eurovignette\" EU directive (1999/62/EC article 7 and 2006/38/EC) requires that user charges may not discriminate on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier or the origin of the vehicle. The authority has contracted a collection agency, ParkTrade, which in turn has contracted collection agencies in the most common countries that charge the owners, using the brand name EPASS24.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nRoad pricing\nCongestion pricing\nElectronic toll collection\nStockholm congestion tax\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwedish Road Administration Congestion taxes in Stockholm and Gothenburg\nLaw on congestion tax Lag (2004:629) om tr\u00e4ngselskatt (Swedish)",

At the time Bohusl\u00e4n (B\u00e5huslen) was Norwegian territory and served as the main Norwegian defence against Sweden, along the coast as well as the strong point for the Bohusl\u00e4n region from 1308 to 1658.\n\n\n== Medieval castle ==\nAccording to architect Guthorm Kavli:\n\nBy 1310, records show it was constructed, as normal for that period, out of granite and brick, perhaps under the guidance of Count Jacob of Halland. By 1450, it included a continuous surrounding wall, 3 metres thick at the base, with a height which varied from 8.5 to 13.5 metres, varying with the terrain. It was approximately rectangular, with four rectangular corner towers. At the eastern end there was a brick tower, and in the centre of the west side a gate house and drawbridge. Along the inside of the surrounding wall buildings were located which among other things included the 'Kings hall', the castle commander's residence, the chapel, the guardroom, the barracks and the kitchen. The fortress had secure vaulted positions, partly cut into the mountain, and beyond that strong outer-works. At the time B\u00e5hus was Norway's strongest fortress. The approaches were very difficult and the area to be defended was small, only 250 x 150 metres, so it did not require a large defensive force.\n\n\n== Fortress ==\n\nThe fortress was attacked or besieged 14 times, but was never captured. During the Northern Seven Years' War, in 1563\u20131570, it was seriously damaged. This occurred in 1566, when 250 Swedish soldiers successfully stormed the northeastern-most tower. The Norwegian commander sent in a volunteer to blow up the ammunition stores underneath the tower, killing the Swedes and repelling the attack. As a reward the family of the volunteer got a piece of land which is still owned by the descendants of this volunteer.\nThe Norwegians rebuilt the fortress of stone and brick, and reinforced it substantially. The reconstruction immediately after the war was directed by Hans Paaske (P\u00e5ske) from the Netherlands. On 1 January 1590 James VI of Scotland and his wife Anne of Denmark came to Bohus. They gave Henrik Gyldenstierne, Captain of Bohus, a ring and a gold chain worth 3,000 Danish dalers.In 1593\u20131604, similar to the construction then undertaken at Akershus in Oslo, Bohus was upgraded to a bastion fortress. A new outer fortification was raised. This construction was one of the early works of Hans van Steenwinckel, also from the Netherlands, who later became noted for his Dutch Renaissance style design in Denmark.\nAs Swedish invasions continuously threatened Norwegian B\u00e5huslen during this time period, the improvement of the fortifications went on for years. For example, starting in the summer of 1651 and until the autumn of 1652, the Dutch engineer Isaac van Geelkerck supervised the construction of two corner towers along the south fa\u00e7ade and a new ring wall that was constructed around the arsenal building.\n\n\n== Loss to Sweden ==\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the Danish provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland (the latter was agreed to belong to Sweden for a period of 30 years after the Peace of Br\u00f6msebro, but was given to Sweden permanently in the treaty of Roskilde) and the Norwegian provinces Tr\u00f8ndelag and Bohusl\u00e4n (including the Bohus Fortress).After Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the territory which included Bohus Fortress, Fredriksten Fortress was constructed in Fredrikshald on the newly established Norwegian-Swedish border.\nSince the Bohus Fortress no longer lay on the border, it was of small use to Sweden, which relied on the existing \u00c4lvsborg fortress at Gothenburg and the new Carlsten Fortress built at Marstrand.\n\n\n== Prison ==\nInstead the fortress was used as a prison. The most noted prisoner was the radical pietist Thomas Leopold, who spent 42 years of his life behind bars, 32 of those at Bohus, for his alleged heresies. His stone-clad cell still exists in the castle.\n\n\n== Modern times ==\nAt the end of the 18th century it was decided that the now unused fortress should be demolished. Demolition crews worked at the fortress for two months, after that the money allocated for the job had run out. Residents of the nearby town of Kung\u00e4lv used the dressed stone from the fortress to build houses. However, much of the fortress is still intact, including the large northern tower, Fars hatt (\"Father's hat\"). As of 2015, the fortress is a museum open to visitors during summer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "This museum is very near our hotel Riverton when we are living in Sweden. It's not a big museum but it seems to offer a lot. There are a fair number of displays.The museum was very well presented and had a very good layout. It was really enjoyable to walk through the museum and",
          "This was really cool, and huge! Which seems to be the case in a lot of museums in Sweden and Norway. They go on and on. Not in a bad way though. We arrived and realised it was free for under 25s which was a big bonus for us! There were many expeditions and a map and toilets",
          "I absolutely loved the viking exhibits, including a boat, jewellery & many more different bits steeped in history & well worth a read. I now know the story behind mistletoe! Proper sinister. It\u2019s 40 kronor (about 4\u00a3/\u20ac) to get in but the ticket gives you access to about 5 other",
          "Well laid out museum which was based on the V and A in London architecturally. Perfect for a rainy day. Different sections showing the history of the city and its inhabitants. All signage was in English as well as Swedish. Nice cafeteria .Toilets and lockers to leave coats etc.",
          "I came to learn more about the history of the city. This musyhas an excellent display on the birth of the city that easily flows into modern times. As a bonus, there are displays on prehistoric people I the area and most of the pieces of an ancient Viking ship that washed out",
          "The entrance for people under 25 years is free. I learnt a lot about Gotheburgs history. It's the perfect program for a day of bad weather.",
          "My family and I visited the City Museum since it is a must do in Goteborg. There, you can learn the history of the early Norsemen, learn the history of Swedish culture and learn about the 400 years of Goteborg! You can easily spend many hours walking from room to room looking at",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect of this museum but was really impressed by how large it is and how in depth it goes into each time period. The special 'Birth of Gothenburg' exhibition was really well presented and immersive. The museum was a little tricky to navigate,a little more",
          "I knew very little about the history of the city until I spent a pleasant 1 1/2 hours at this small museum. The signage is in English as well as Swedish, and the artifacts are well displayed. The admission fee provides a ticket that is good for 3 days at 4 or 5 museums in the",
          "The museum was ok, a typical museum. I wanted to visit to see the old Viking ship, which is the only one in sweden. This was really interesting. I would visit again just for the ship.",
          "Interesting city museum with the classical themes from such institutions starting with early human settlements to today's developments. Most of the visit is quite classical with artefacts from different periods and presented in a standard way but a few themes are developed with",
          "The city museum is a bit boring to be honest. Some confusing information, especially when it comes to earlier history. Facts, legends and myths were mixed without having a clear enough distinction. The modern history was just not that interesting due to the average setup. Could",
          "Exhibition on Swedish music was fun, and old Viking ship interesting. Small play area for under 4s helpful for a quick run around as well.",
          "We did not allow enough time to see everything in this musuem [you will need at least 2 - 21/2 hrs] but what we enjoyed it all the same. Fantastic historical treasures from as far back as the 12th century. There are ipad displays for most sections and you can select eack item on",
          "There are several temporary exhibits on a variety of themes as well as the permanent exhibits. In preparation for the 400th anniversary of Gothenburg in 2021, they recently opened an exhibit on the birth of Gothenburg. This exhibit is kid-friendly and very informative.",
          "The museum is free for students and young people and is magnificently structured, although many items are of no real historical value. But the designers and the historians who created the museum did a great job. A little hipster perhaps.",
          "Very hit and miss - some sections were very interesting, but the more recent history was quite boring and very dry. In the 'earlier' section it kept flitting between facts and myths with no clear differentiation which I felt was a bit confusing.",
          "It is comfortable with baby carriage take an elevator and enjoy playing at the children's room. Specially in rainy weather it works perfect.",
          "Very disappointed to find that the museum was closed on A Monday in the height of the tourist season end June. We we're here Sunday and Monday and were really looking forward to going - can understand Sunday but Monday as well... Whilst we tried to get in about 10 other people",
          "For a smaller city, this museum was impressive. It is house in the East India Tea Company building. The exhibits were informative and the layout was \"jet-lag friendly.\"",
          "For a history buff like me, this was a great visit. Some sections of the Museum were in construction, so I did not a full overview of the city's history, but the parts that were open were well designed, informative and interesting.",
          "This museum is found in the former East India Company office building that's not too impressive from the outside, but inside is incredible! The displays are well organized, but many of the English notices on displays cannot be read. The Swedish notice is in dark ink, but the",
          "How amazing was the time spent inside this place, different stories from the beginning until nowadays!",
          "I learned so much from this visit - even though I do not read Swedish! There is sufficient signage in English to fully understand the information. Very good presentation",
          "Most local history museums do not have the quantity or quality of items that are on display here. I came expecting to be in and out in an hour but instead spent a good 3 hours.The 4 Euro charge is good for a year and is valid at other museums. The building itself is worth while",
          "I was back at the City Museum to try the new exhibit about the birth of the city. The exhibition makes a good job of introducing the story of western Sweden in the 15th and 16th century, the backdrop for Goteborg creation. Two movies, sounds, maps, artefacts, the museum made",
          "A good place for parents with small kids as it has a play area at the 3rd floor which will keep your little ones engaged. Also the museum is free for adults under 25 and have lot of good collection about Gothenburg history. The museum is covered in the museum pass which includes",
          "A small museum but very good collection of household stuff from the 1900 era. You can see this museum in about a half hour",
          "Very nice to see Gothenbergs history. The Children screaming wasn't fun. But the Life history is a must see.",
          "This museum is free for those under the age of 25. As some other reviews mentioned, the layout of the museum is pretty confusing. There are multiple staircases on each floor, and hidden hallways, making it easy to miss a section of the galleries. The 2nd floor has a permanent",
          "I was amazed how cheap the entry was, 40kr, (\u00a34 apprx) for an annual pass with access to other museums across the city. Some mind blowing facts about the settlement of Gothenburg. The best part for me was the preserved viking ship/Viking exhibition. Awesome!",
          "I got an amazing Christmas gift from the girlfriend to go to G\u00f6tenborg for a weeiend and this was a good way to begin. Here you will find a great introduction the areas history and some pretty cool, only to be found here, Viking stuff. Along with 12,000 year old artefacts and",
          "It is small and a number of the exhibits were closed for renovation. It is nice enough and most exhibits are translated into English. One gets a sense of the evolution of the city through time, although the section on the founding was closed, so the narrative is broken up. The",
          "We likes this museum very much. In short time we'd the possibility to be informed about the top events from the Swedish history.",
          "With G\u00f6teborg city card we could visit this museum free of charge. It was not so big, but very interesting. There was a part \"Touchable\" where you can imagine the world without eyesight or hearing. This can be visited till 19 February 2017. We had a great time in this museum",
          "This museum is very near our home when we are living in Sweden. It's not a big museum but it seems to offer a lot. There are a fair number of displays. However, where I think it really shines is the kid-friendly space upstairs. You can get a yearly museum pass for quite",
          "I love to go there as I had leisure time, as this place gives immense clam to yourself. you can enjoy evening time.",
          "The museum was very well presented and had a very good layout. It was really enjoyable to walk through the museum and experience artefacts through the ages. Be warned that it was full of kids when we visited, therefore if you are looking for a very quiet experience you may not",
          "This is a very well presented museum highlighting Gothenburg and Sweden through the ages, my favourite part was the Viking exhibition with a long ship on display. It is good for a rainy day or the extra few hours you have to spare. It is close to hip cafes and the canal.",
          "Visited on my last day in town because I had time to kill. Entry is only 40kr which gets you into four other museums in the city, with validity until the end of the year (a season ticket, basically). Take a 5kr coin for the locker room. Most (but not all) information is also",
          "I'm not the most patient museum visitor and get bored very quickly, however I found this a great place to visit. One of the 5 museums for 40 SEK that you can visit on a single ticket. The Viking ship may not be complete but it is a fascinating exhibit. There is a lot about how",
          "The historical exhibits give a nice colorful overview of starting with prehistoric times. There are good explanations in English. The museum has the remains of a Viking boat, plus some nice Viking artifacts. Again, explanations in English are very good. We moved quickly through",
          "Although the exhibition on music scene in Gothenburg was good, the fact that some of the main permanent galleries were closed was disappointing - including those on the history of the city",
          "I visited the City Muesum as recommended by the Goteburg City Card with the entry being free. This musuem is ok but not the best that Gothenburg has to offer. It has some good exhibits which included the viking ship but the rest wasn't really awe inspiring. I'm glad I went",
          "If you are under 25 and in Gbg, do go visit this place. The entry is free for under 25, you can see a bunch of cool stuff regarding this city's history. Go up to the last floor and you'll find an interesting music exibition about Gbg music life :)",
          "A bit disappointed with this museum. It wasn't very well organized and for us non-Swedish speaking visitors, we missed out on large portions where the exhibits were entirely in Swedish.",
          "The museum is interesting although it hasn't got a lot to offer. The viking ship is the most advertised attraction but I believe the top of the visit is a 4500-years-old skeleton.",
          "Much to see and very informative. You buy your ticket and can go for free in the natural history or arts museum at 40sek. Loved it.",
          "This is a good value museum without having any 'wow' for the average tourist. However, the floor showing the development of music in Gothenburg is brilliant. Very well put together, you can listen to lots of different genres and the dancing booth with examples and practice is",
          "Based in the building of the East India Company (no, I didn't know Sweden had one too!) this museum has some excellent information and artefacts, particularly around the viking era, including the oldest / most complete viking boat in the world. The craftmanship and technology",
          "Provides historical information and has some interesting exhibits. Not really a \"must see\" place but fills in some time. For people who are serious about knowing more about Gothenburg this museum will meet your requirement.",
          "This is a very nice museum which has lots of interesting exhibits relevant to the history of Gothenburg. There is enough to keep you interested for 2 or 3 hours and the bonus of a nice restaurant for lunch when you have finished looking around.",
          "We got to go for free on the city card (which is definitely worthwhile). OK museum, interesting viking display etc. Though a bit hard to understand when most of the signs and information in Swedish.",
          "The entry fee was worth it for the excellent Viking history exhibit which includes the amazing nine hundred year old remains of a Viking trading ship dug up from the mud in the 1930's plus jewellery and objects from the Viking era. The rest of the museum contains objects",
          "Considering entree was only 40 SEK, this museum was a great value. Cool exhibit on Vikings and prehistoric Sweden. Worth a visit, probably only an hour or two. Has information in English but the text is in light green making it difficult to read :/",
          "Attractive interior layout with some exhibits more interesting than others. The exhibit on prehistory was only ok and plaques talked about that time period generally rather than what was happening in Gothenburg. The far more interesting exhibits are on 18th-19th centuries. Lots",
          "We went primarily to see the Viking ship. though little remains of it. The museum is one of the many attractions available with the City Card (also free trams, buses and ferries). It is currently under renovation, so two large sections are unavailable, having said that the rest",
          "Housed in the original home of the East India Trading Company, built in the mid-1700s, this is a wonderful museum in which to learn about the Vikings in the area, then the life and lives of Goteborg in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries ... from social life, trading,",
          "For 40 SEK you get an annual admission for 5 museums in Gothenburg. This one is nice and many displays are also explained in English. The house itself is an former trading building & it's just nice to wander thru the rooms and storeys.",
          "Stadmuseum is a great opportunity to get knowing the Gothenburg city. It has everything in one building, starting from Viking history up to modern times. The best thing is that you can buy a single ticket (40 SEK for adult) and visit this museum for many times, because it is",
          "Nice museum, plenty of Viking based stuff, learned a lot of stuff I didn't know about life in Sweden.",
          "Interesting museum - history, attractions, Vikings ... and our children are very loved this museum, we were able to try out the costumes of the past and in them a picture.",
          "Great museum depicting the history of G\u00f6teborg from pre-history to the present day. It also has a real Viking ship. Entry is only 40sek per person and that gives you entrance to the R\u00f6hsska Museet (fashion), Konstmuseet (art), Sj\u00f6fartsmuseet Akvariet (maritime and aquarium),",
          "An interesting tour of Gothenburgs history from the earliest settlement of the area, through the Viking age, and up until today. The pre-historic part was frustrating, since it didn't tell the date or find location of most of the artefacts. The Viking cargo ship, and extensive",

          "Having done school work with my Y2 class on the Battle of Hastings it was good to see lots of information about the invading Vikings who were beaten at the Battle of Stamford Bridge by Harold before his defeat at Hastings. The viking ship was a great sight and I took photos to",
          "Worth a visit, particularly for the viking exhibition, which was very informative. The narrative explanations are very good, but sometimes they don't actually tell you what the object is you're looking at, which can lead to confusion. The room on Swedish colonialism and racial",
          "Museum is open everyday except Mondays and prominent holidays like christmas. Entry fee is very affordable and you can get a card which is valid for whole one year and in 4 other city museums besides this. Museum provides a view in the life and times of the city. It shows some",
          "We only called in here as we were passing and it was covered with our city pass but well worth the minimal entrance fee which covers lots of great museums in one ticet. The building is great and the exhibitions really interesting and informative. The temporary exhibition on the",
          "This was a very interesting museum with lots to see. There was the right amount of exhibits and the right amount of information about them. It is well laid out and there is something for adults and children alike. The cafe was superb, for 59 SEK we had a huge lunch with drinks",
          "Stopped in here to see the photography exhibit based on the musical history of g\u00f6teborg and we were not disappointed one bit. It was a great exhibit with sections set up indicative of the particular genre. There was music to listen to via iPad's which was a novel touch. The rest",
          "Good museum on the history of the city with models of city construction phases. Very informative and not that expensive, you get a ticket to naval museum also for reasonable price. Both worth the visit.",
          "I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this museum. I was impressed to find out that the city of Goteborg was practically fully designed by Dutch settlers and architects. It was also made \"Dane's proof\" as the Swedish considered the Danes their worse enemies. The building is",
          "Time travel through the history of Gothenburg and don't forget the exhibitions that are there only for a short period of time. That for only 40 sek, the ticket lasts a year and also is four for other museums in town. Don't miss the shop!",
          "Color lights are totally headache, little information and poor pieces of china . The feeling was so fake.",
          "40 krone entry gets your 4-5 museums scattered around the gb. Some good history in this place, the building itself being a historical monument. Do appreciate the swede style on things, and is a must see in Goteborg.",
          "This really presents the entire history of the city in a very appealing and easy way. Almost every exhibit was accessible to English-speakers/readers and it really helped us understand Sweden and Gothenburg marvelously. A must for any tourist.",
          "A great place to experience an extensive history of Gothenburg. An extensive and spacious museum with well presented exhibits and mostly wheelchair accessible via a number of elevators. Great place to spend a rainy day.",
          "Great little museum that gives you some history of the city. Well worth visiting and spending an afternoon here. Also, the admission cost is cheap and it allows you to get into four other museums within the city for free! Can't beat that!",
          "Free entry for people under 25, so I was very happy about that. The museum itself is quite small in comparison to other museums, but I felt that this was more of a strength than a weakness. It meant that all of the content needed to well curated to keep you interested, because",
          "This Museum is located in the heart of the city and a short walk from Brunnsparken. You can travel through GBG in various decades and there\u00b4s much to see- from ship till crafts, they have a lovely collection of almost everything that is linked to GBG over the decades. Kids",
          "Fabulous building, amazing museum, excellent coffee shop, in a great area, spent ages in here so much to see and do",
          "This is an amazing museum. They went to great lengths not only making this user friendly, but fascinating. I was especially interested in the 18th and 19th century collections. Fantastic! The garden (back) is lovely too and the fresco's on the wall great. The staff is friendly",
          "Best for those who can speak Swedish, but there are English explanations in places. Particularly good for those who enjoy traditional museums",
          "We visited the museum today and found it a great way to spend some time in the city of G\u00f6teborg. Although the exhibits are somewhat limited, the ones presented are interesting, especially the Viking exhibit. It would have been interesting to have more on the Norse gods. Nice",
          "Visited on an early morning in September, I think I was one of the first people to walk in and it was great. I had time to read and look at the art and the evolution of the city. Very interesting. I loved the Viking section. You cannot miss that! I also enjoyed the way they",
          "It was a nice museum. Hard to read the descriptions of the items in the museums but otherwise not bad. Liked the history of Gothenburg better than the other stuff.",
          "It is a small but interesting museum. The collection tell the story of the city of Gothenburg and by association o the history of Sweden. Well worth a visit.",
          "I thought this museum was okay. We were lucky to go on a free day, so that helps with my review. I thought some of the rooms were interesting, but they varied as to whether they were in Swedish or English. As an English speaker, it was difficult to enjoy all the rooms since",
          "the museum is set in a beautiful old building along the river, very central part of the city. Inexpensive entrance fee, good facilities inside and a nice overview of the city. Some exhibitions have English but just as many do not, no problem, we just enjoyed looking at the",
          "There are several sections of this museum, and even though I wasn't interested in the modern art, or music sections, the historical aspects are well worth the visit. There are fascinating pictures and information about a children's (hospital and orphanage I think). It's heart",
          "Nice historical artifacts to be seen, but some of the explanatory signs were not translated. There was some weird modern art mixed in with the Viking exhibition. This was distracting.",

          "Gothenburg is a beautiful city, but if you get a rainy afternoon this is a good place to spend an hour or two. It's cheap to get in - just 40 kronor for an annual pass and free for under 25s, and the ticket gets you into some other museums in the city as well. There's some",
          "The museum's collections are very well presented, appealing to both children and adults, and give a comptehensive insight into the city's history and development, from prehistory right up to present day. - Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Prehistory & viking exhibition was nothing special, but I liked hoe the City history was presented. Big minus was that 1600 - 1700 century was missing English translations!",
          "The museum is excellent for a rainy afternoon because it has a great selection and it will take a few hours to see everything. There is a nice mix of old history (Vikings, history of G\u00f6teborg, etc) and more current themes in the exhibitions. I found this combination very",
          "Very good overview about the history. You can learn a lot about the Vikings, the city history. The atmosphere is excellent",

          "In a city blessed by a multitude of museums and other attractions this, the largest, is a must, especially if you have an interest in history. The museum is housed in the original 18th century headquarters of the Swedish East India Company which in itself is a fascinating",
          "I was disappointed to find that the Viking ship was not complete but just laid out on the floor. The Viking gallery was very dark and very few artefacts but I particularly liked the small sickle. Each gallery was presented in a different way, some being more interactive that",
          "One of my favourite city museums. Small but effective. Especially loved the Viking exhibit which was beautifully done, and in my opinion more effective than Copenhagen museum's larger exhibit.",
          "It's huge! We couldn't finish in just a few hours so I'm definitely going back! It has viking and 1500s, 1600s, and on, it's super interesting and amazing! The only downfall is that some of the exhibitions are not translated to English so that was a little weird but overall it",
          "This museum was full of beautifully maintained viking artifacts, Christian artifacts from the time of the conversion from paganism to Christianity and items from the city of Gothenburg's founding. It was very interesting and well laid out with displays explained in English as",
          "An interesting insight into Gothenburg, being not able to speak/ read Swedish it came as a surprise just how much had been translated!",
          "Brilliant exhibition about the Vikings. Well designed and English translations. Also in the museum there are lots of interesting artefacts explaining some of the social history.",
          "The visitor is treated to a walk through time as you move from early viking relics to the 1900's. Most of the exhibition is in English and Swedish although some sections still under construction just had Swedish descriptions. The small cafe downstairs provided a good lunch after",
          "Very easy to find, close to other attractions. Almost all exhibits were translated to English so it was easier to understand.",
          "The Viking exhibit was fantastic. An actual Viking ship was the centerpiece. It was quite deteriorated, but still managed to thrill us!",

          "Good museum to get to know the region and the city's past. Due to the works on the quay it was not so easy to reach.",
          "This museum is located at the East Indies Company building, in the heart of Gothenburg. Exhibitions tell the history of the city in a very didactic and fun way. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "In a lovely old building that lent itself to this purpose with connecting galleries that flow from one period of history to the next, the Viking room particularly well done on two levels. Most of the notations are in English as well which was a bonus as the the political and",
          "Very good in telling the story of Gothenburg with many artifcacts and good texts, though some weren't translated to English. The viking rooms are interesting, but I actually preferred the ones explaining the foundation of the city up to the 20th Century. Also, great gift shop!",
          "The museum provides an overview of Gothenburg from the Viking age up to the present day. It's okay but not the best museum I've been to. The exhibits don't go into that much detail and quite a few are not in English.",
          "The museum has both temporary exhibitions and exhibitions that remain throughout the year. It's located inside the former trading company \"Ostindiska Kompaniet\" ( Eastindian Company ). That company used to travel from G\u00f6teborg to China and other at the time exotic places and",
          "This museum has many interesting artifacts and information. There were Viking coins, jewelry, tools and a ship, all were well displayed. The history of Gothenburg was intriguing as well. Had artifacts like an original key to the city gates, a display on how the East India Co",
          "A nice survey of the history of the area. Good section exploring changes in Swedish culture. The building is also good example of fine Swedish architecture",
          "The museum gives a brief overview about the history, starting with the Vikings and ending up somewhere in the 19-somewhat. So new Gothenborg does not exist. Most of the exhibition is also in English, but not 100 %. Frankly spoken, I have seen better ones, done with more care.",
          "I went here hoping to learn all about the city's past with regards to the Danish/Swedish wars. This wasn't really covered - at least not that I could find. Quite a few of the exhibitions aren't in English, too. There is a Viking section with an actual Viking boat on display",
          "Just the history of Gothenburg and surrounds. Enough for about 2 hours. The viking ship was cool. Could have done with a better souvenir shop.",
          "Brilliant - as my great grandfather was a mariner this was a must for us. We were not disappointed. Highly recommend this venue on your Goteborg visit.",
          "The museum was full of exhibits on the 15th,16th,17th and 18th century history of Gothenburg. It is worth spending a couple of hours there.",
          "The viking collection was interesting, but I found the rest of the museum rather boring. Most of the exhibits (if not all) had explanations in English.",

          "Viking ship is a bit pants - much better ones in Oslo! The section on medieval history is only in Swedish, but the later rooms that trace expansion of the city, planning of the walls and canals, role of the city in trade and in Sweden's short-lived imperial ambitions are all in",
          "I took relatives here a couple of times and then stopped doing that. The collections are haphazard, uninteresting and the information in English was poor. Very disappointing.",

          "Go: 1) If you are interested why G\u00f6teborg reminds a typical dutch city with all its channels and bridges; 2) If you travelling with curious kids - they will be occupied with museum quest and very good playground on the top floor; 3) If you like to explore an old building,",
          "it's one more museum with nothing special. I was expecting to see more detail on the history of the city.",
          "A nice little museum with a good (but small) section about Vikings and the remains of a Viking boat on display. Very cheap to enter, and the ticket also gets you into a few other museums such as the Maritime Museum. Good museum for a short visit, most (but not all) captions",
          "This museum offers a fascinating ruin of a Viking ship. What I liked best, however, were aspects of earlier material culture. You could see Swedish design in the making: old bits of houses, things dug up by archaeologists, etc. This helped us understand Sweden. Recommended if",
          "The Viking exhibit was fascinating and compelling. It was very well done, with signage in English and Swedish. The museum also had exhibits on the rest of the history of g\u00f6teborg, which were also well put together, but for me the Vikings exhibit was the best part of the museum.",
          "The Stadsmuseum has a small but beautiful exhibit on Viking culture and arts with signature in Swedish and English. The large room on early Christian art is extraordinary; its only failing is the exclusive use of Swedish. The objects, however, tell their own eloquent story.",
          "The part about the older history was nice, but the younger history, the part we came there for, was - well, not impressive. You\u00b4ll get some pieces from the citys story, and you\u00b4ll get i cheap. The fee will let you enter several other museums too during you stay. That\u00b4s good!",
          "This is worth going to. The Viking ship on display is the only one in Sweden and helps make sense of the Viking culture. Some myths are definitely exploded. The history of the city is done well. The exhibits are done in both English and Swedish in the main. At the moment",
          "You can see some wonderful works by European masters in this lovely museum, and it's in the center of town, so enjoy the environment as well.",
          "I went specifically to see the Romer Exhibit. I found the exhibit to be an informative, artistic, historic work which encompassed social commentary in an unobtrusive manner. I did view some of the historic sections of the museum also, and found that there was an interesting",
          "The good: This small museum fools you in thinking there's not much to see but it is quite the opposite! The only exhibited Viking ship (well, what is left of it) and the adjoining exhibition about the Vikings is a MUST SEE! Well done and most of the museums exhibits are",
          "Located right in the old part of town on the canal, this museum offers an interesting history of the area. I was impressed with the Viking display, which includes the remains of a Viking ship. There are good descriptions in English and Swedish [at least up to the Viking era].",
          "You can learn about history there, a lot of things to do, and a really nice playground if you have children",
          "Really enjoyed this museum - especially the viking part and learning about Gothenburg through the ages. Everything in english too, staff helpful, great entrance price at 40 kr which also gets you into the art museum and other places on the same ticket.",
          "I wanted my teenage daughters to know a little bit about Gothenburg's history, not just be familiar with the shopping centers down town, so I convinced them that it would be worth spending 2 hours at \"Stadsmuseet\". After a bit hesitation they followed me. I was surprised how",
          "Great value for the entry fee. The Viking exhibit is really cool! Almost everything is translated into English. Follow the history of Gothenburg from the Stone Age to almost present times. We really enjoyed it!",
          "museum with a broad overview of the Swedish history and culture; free entrance with the Gothenburg card",
          "It was kind of a mash up of things, but very interesting. We were quite disappointed because the English displays for items disappeared about halfway through the museum. I would have liked to have known what I was looking at. We had a good time though and the displays were great!",
          "Nice museum that give you a great insight in the history of Gothenburg. Best of all I like the prehistoric exhibition, really interesting especially the thing from viking age. I think it\u00b4s well worth a visit.",
          "The reason I went to this museum and for me the reason to go was the Viking exhibition. The famous Viking boat was, admittedly, pretty much a bunch of boards in the vague shape of a boat. But it was fascinating to be in the presence of something so old and imbued with such",
          "The Viking section and the bit about prehistoric man is what really made this museum come alive for my family, with all of us enjoying looking at the various exhibits.",
          "We really enjoy this museum after they built the new play area for small kids. The entrance fee is also low, and it lasts for the whole year.",
          "The actual buildings and auction room where the boatloads of treasures from China were sold. From this foundation the Museum has expanded with many many different collections. The staff is extremely knowledgeable. Most interested to answer your specific questions about the",
          "This museum provides a thorough overview of the history of the city through the centuries. Everything is laid out in order so if you're not particularly interested in a specific time period you can skip or breeze through that room to get to the interesting stuff. I especially",
          "Good overview of Gothenburg's history and a great first stop if you like knowing the history of the place before you truly explore it. It was fairly quiet when I visited, but the attractions were interesting and there was even an area geared towrd children. My only problem was",
          "It was a nice an quiet museum overall. Small if compared to one in London or in Washington. Free with Goteborg card and ok to spend an hour or so strolling around.",
          "Recently refurbished, this museum tells the story of Gothenburg from prehistory to the present day. As well as the usual runes and bustles, it has the remains of the only viking ship on permanent display in Sweden. The 40kr. entry fee also gains access to the Art , Design and",
          "I didn't expect too much, but this ended up being one of the highlights of the city. We learned a little more about Vikings, but more importantly, there were a lot of great things about how the city has grown. Perhaps not interesting for kids under 14, but for adults",
          "Somewhat interesting but also disappointing at the same time. Viking \"ship\" is really just a few bits of wood. Very little information on Viking history or lifestyle. What there is rather disjointed. Other displays unremarkable but dated.",
          "I think this museum is as common as others but here you can have a look to the history of Gothenburg.",
          "If you have some time in your hands, this is definitely a good place to go to in Gothenburg. For just 40SEK, you have access to an interesting exhibit about the history of the city, from pre-historic times to the modern day. This is a large, very complete museum in which you",
          "Paid 40Kr per person to get in, which is a bargain. Wasn't so much impressed by the Viking exhibit as I've seen better in Norway, and was more happy with their other exhibits showcasing the history of the area and of Swedish culture. Incidentally, the ticket you pay to get into",
          "My husband and I were in G\u00f6teborg for the Easter weekend and thought we would be left with nothing to do, but fortunately, several museums were open, much to our delight! The City Museum is a clean and modern museum in a beautiful old building. One of the delightful things",
          "Evidently run by conservators with very limited knowledge of nordic history. - Unconnected \"Shows\" of bits and pieceses out of context.",
          "Located in the dockside building previously used by the East India Company. A lovely, modern museum with really interesting displays. Has the remains of a viking ship. Entertaining for kids but loads to keep adults interested, lots of interesting displays. Good value, free for",
          "If you have half an hour to spare, this museum could be worth a visit. It could be interesting as it sheds light on the immigration and emigration of Swedes in Gothenburg in the 19th century (police records did not begin until 1869).",
          "This museum has several floors of exhibits depicting life in Gothenburg over the centuries. A wonderful way to learn about the history of this city.",
          "A must to see, even you have to walk a lot , buts when its not raining its nicel",
          "This passed an hour or so, but is quite a small and traditional (most things in glass cabinets) museum showing the history of Gothenburg.",
          "Both my 7 y. o. and I really enjoyed this museum. The Viking exhibit was interesting, with the remains of the original Viking boat. (The boat remains are spread out flat, not as a reconstructed boat, and I think my son was disappointed). I liked the building itself, as it old",
          "This is an excellent museum covering the history of the city from prehistoric times, to Viking times, through the more recent growth due to international trade in the 17th to 20th centuries. Most of the captions have English translations. Note that for the two galleries that"

It is situated in a classicistic building from 1923 at G\u00f6taplatsen in the center of the city, next to Gothenburg Museum of Art (G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum). G\u00f6teborgs Konsthall investigates the various forms of contemporary art and presents around five exhibitions a year.  Alongside the exhibitions, G\u00f6teborgs Konsthall presents guided tours, creative workshops, artists talks, workshops, film screenings, performances, and in-depth lectures. Entrance is always free of charge for both program and exhibitions.\n\n\n== History ==\nG\u00f6teborgs Konsthall was designed by architects Sigfrid Ericson (1879-1958) and Arvid Bjerke (1880-1952).\nG\u00f6teborgs Konsthall was built during 1923  as an art exhibition hall for the Gothenburg Exhibition  (Jubileumsutst\u00e4llningen i G\u00f6teborg) in celebration of the city's 300th anniversary. After the jubilee fair, the Gothenburg art association took over the direction until 1968 when the direction was handed over to the city and G\u00f6teborgs Konsthall became a part of Gothenburg Museum of Art. In 1995 the city decided to close down G\u00f6teborgs Konsthall due to financial difficulties. After protests the exhibition space was reopened in 1996 and stayed open until 2000. In 2001 the konsthall reopened as a division of the City of Gothenburg Cultural Affairs Administration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Related reading ==\nS\u00f6dergren, Arvid (1923) Historiskt kartverk \u00f6ver G\u00f6teborg uppr\u00e4ttat f\u00f6r jubileumsutst\u00e4llningen i G\u00f6teborg (G\u00f6teborg: V.

        "wiki": "R\u00f6da Sten Konsthall is a contemporary art center located in the district of Majorna under \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in Gothenburg, Sweden. Konsthall roughly translates to \"Art Gallery\" however the organization is much more similar to a German Kunsthalle. R\u00f6da Sten Konsthall is an exhibition space for a diverse range of cultural events and art exhibitions, is home to Gothenburg's only legal graffiti wall \"Draken\" and hosts a rich program of educational activities for all ages.\nRSK presents an exhibition program of contemporary art and has collaborated with Swedish and international artists such as Jeremy Deller, Carsten H\u00f6ller, Natalie Djurberg/Hans Berg, Ylva Ogland, Phil Collins, and Rachel Maclean, among many others, is home to the G\u00f6teborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art, collaborates with Valand Academy to exhibit the photography program's degree show, hosts choral and opera performances at the beginning of each year and since 2013 has held a design and craft focused Christmas market.\n\n\n== History ==\nR\u00f6da Sten Konsthall was originally built in 1940 as an old boiler house that supplied the industries of Klippan with heat. It was then used as a warehouse for hazardous waste, abandoned and stood empty for many years. The building, owned by the city of Gothenburg, was set to be demolished as it was seen as a \"festering sore\" on the city, because it was home to intense rave parties and covered in graffiti. This was the place that inspired Kulturprojekt R\u00f6da Sten.\n\nBob Kelly, a businessman and entrepreneur, had seen how people in the USA and England were renovating and re-purposing old factory buildings into spaces for cultural and artistic activities. He believed the boiler house had the potential to become a similar project. Kelly contacted Per H\u00e5ll\u00e9n, who at the time was a district committee representative of the Left Party for the Majorna district of Gothenburg, and who from January 1992 was also a member of the Gothenburg City Council. Kelly and H\u00e5ll\u00e9n then approached Folke Edwards the Director of the Gothenburg Museum of Art and Akke Zimdal, an architect from the firm Lund&Valentin to add an art institutional/architectural perspectives to the group. These four \u201cfounders\u201d soon expanded the group by adding people with different strengths: artist and former professor of painting Kent Karlsson, and economist Lars Stranneg\u00e5rd.\n\n\n=== First functions at R\u00f6da Sten ===\nDuring the summer of 1994, the Property Management Administration completed a provisional repair of the boiler house.  The premiere program was a newly composed \u201cpsycho-acoustic\u201d opera performance based on Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel The Idiot.In September 1994, thirty-seven artists from Majorna exhibited their work in the boiler house as a manifestation of Kulturprojekt R\u00f6da Sten.\nOctober 1994 brought another exhibition: Ready for Landing, an installation by Michel and Eva Droetto. Forty-five tons of soil were trucked in for the exhibition and covered the floor in the cathedral.In 1995, the Friends of R\u00f6da Sten Association was established, and during 1995\u20131999 the R\u00f6da Sten Project was dedicated to finding financing and planning for the renovation of the building.\n\n\n=== Renovation and inauguration ===\nShipping magnate Sten Allan Olsson pledged a donation of three million SEK (approximately 360,000 USD) toward the boiler house renovation. The County Labor Board contributed free labor, and the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning offers one million SEK (approximately 120,000 USD) to the renovation. S\u00f6ren Mannheimer, chairperson of the Chalmers Technical University Foundation, offers 500,000 SEK (approximately 60,000 USD) toward the property renovation and an equal amount for collaboration between artists from R\u00f6da Sten and technology students from Chalmers.Between September 1999 and September 2000, the boiler house was renovated.\nOn October 6, 2000, the renovated boiler house was rededicated.\n\n\n== From Culture Project to Konsthall ==\n\n\n=== 2005 ===\nR\u00f6da Sten hires its first General Director, Mia Christerdotter Norman.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nThe association changes its name from Kulturprojekt R\u00f6da Sten to R\u00f6da Sten Kulturf\u00f6rening (R\u00f6da Sten Cultural Association).The Municipal Cultural Affairs Committee asks R\u00f6da Sten Kulturf\u00f6rening to arrange the 2007 G\u00f6teborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art (GIBCA)\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\nThe pilot for the arts education & social program Young & Creative begins.\nThe Executive Board decides to establish a new, independent program committee composed of Henrik Andersson, Lisa Rosendahl, and Fredrik Svensk.R\u00f6da Sten Kulturf\u00f6rening becomes a member of Trans Europe Halles (TEH).\nEdi Muka and Joa Ljungberg are the Curators of GIBCA 2007: Rethinking Dissent.\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\nR\u00f6da Sten hires its first full-time curator, Edi Muka.\nJohan Poussette and Celia Prado are Curators of GIBCA 2009: What a Wonderful World.\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe Executive Board decides that the boiler house and its operations as a whole should be called R\u00f6da Sten Konsthall.The exhibition program begins, with Edi Muka as a curator.

Also a great place for \u201dswedish fika\u201d, beer break and fish taco (that\u2019s more like fish n chips served on tortilla). One of my favourite weekend hangouts with friends.",

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum. On 29 December 2004, the Museum of World Culture opened near Korsv\u00e4gen. Museums include the Gothenburg Museum of Art, and several museums of sea and navigation history, natural history, the sciences, and East India.

The Avenyn was created in the 1860s and 1870s as a result of an international architecture contest, and is the product of a period of extensive town planning and remodelling. Avenyn has Gothenburg's highest concentration of pubs and clubs. Gothenburg's largest shopping centre (8th largest in Sweden), Nordstan, is located in central Gothenburg.\n\nGothenburg's Haga district is known for its picturesque wooden houses and its caf\u00e9s serving the well-known Haga bulle \u2013 a large cinnamon roll similar to the kanelbulle.Five Gothenburg restaurants have a star in the 2008 Michelin Guide: 28 +, Basement, Fond, Kock & Vin, Fiskekrogen, and Sj\u00f6magasinet.\nThe city has a number of star chefs \u2013 over the past decade, seven of the Swedish Chef of the Year awards have been won by people from Gothenburg.The Gustavus Adolphus pastry, eaten every 6 November in Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus Day, is especially connected to, and appreciated in, Gothenburg because the city was founded by King Gustavus Adolphus.One of Gothenburg's most popular natural tourist attractions is the southern Gothenburg archipelago, which is a set of several islands that can be reached by ferry boats mainly operating from Saltholmen. Within the archipelago are the \u00c4lvsborg fortress, Vinga and Styrs\u00f6 islands.\n\n\n=== Festivals and fairs ===\n\nThe annual Gothenburg Film Festival, is the largest film festival in Scandinavia.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies. The blue-collar industries which have dominated the city for long are still important factors in the city's economy, but they are being gradually replaced by high-tech industries.Banking and finance are also important, as well as the event and tourist industry.Gothenburg is the terminus of the Valdemar-G\u00f6teborg gas pipeline, which brings natural gas from the North Sea fields to Sweden, through Denmark.Historically, Gothenburg was home base from the 18th century of the Swedish East India Company. From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

        "wiki": "The R\u00f6hsska Museum (Swedish: R\u00f6hsska museet, earlier named R\u00f6hsska konstsl\u00f6jdsmuseet, also known as Design Museum), is located in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is a museum focused on design, fashion and applied arts.\nThe museum collection consists of over 50,000 objects.  The majority of the collection consists of handicraft and design products from Sweden and Europe and arts and crafts from Japan and China. The museum also holds a very fine collection of fashion from the 20th and 21st centuries, including many haute couture garments from Paris and other famous fashion designs from all over the world. Today, the R\u00f6hsska Museum mainly collects contemporaneous material and the museum seeks to achieve a dialogue with its users on contemporary phenomena and expression.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe R\u00f6hsska Museum was founded in 1904. The financial foundation was a donation from the estate of Wilhelm R\u00f6hss in 1901, and in the ensuing years, further donations were made by people including his brother, August R\u00f6hss. The original building, clad in red, hand-made brick was designed by architect Carl Westman in the National Romantic style. In 1916 the museum was opened to the public.\nThe museum's first curator was Axel Nilsson, who also participated in the construction of the museum. The curators that succeeded him were Gustaf Munthe in 1924, G\u00f6ran Axel-Nilsson in 1946, Jan Brunius in 1972, Christian Axel-Nilsson in 1986, Helena Dahlb\u00e4ck Lutteman in 1996, Lasse Brunnstr\u00f6m in 1998, Elsebeth Welander-Berggren in 2000 and Ted Hesselbom in 2007. In January 2013 Tom Hedqvist was appointed as the new Museum Director.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Really enjoyable and informative. Great exhibit on plastics from the ocean, and recycling. Many exhibits closed",
          "I usually pop in at the R\u00f6hsska Museum whenever I\u2019m in Gothenburg, and it\u2019s always worth it. If you\u2019re interested in design and the history of design, this is for you! A large section of the museum contain permanent exhibitions but there is always a temporary exhibition as well.",
          "I visited here with my friend to enjoy some time and look at arts here Really enjoyed it but I wish that they could decorate here more just like any other museums and spend some time on making it more kid friendly Super nice staffs and enjoyable",
          "I enjoyed my stay here. The foundation has its own history that is well worth getting to know in order to understand the collection and probably often the special exhibitions and its background. Personnel was helpful, orientation was clear, the didactics are modern but",
          "This museum has newly a restoration. It contains both permanent and short time exhibition. The permanent Exhibition is very nice and the museum is large enough for a 2-3 Hour visit.",

          "We went with small children at the end of the day using our prepaid entry as part of a citycard scheme. Most of the floors were closed so we would have been annoyed if we'd paid full price. An interesting eclectic selection of items from over the ages clearly put together by",

          "A museum about design is definitely not very spectacular. Design, however, is around us in our daily life and seriously affects our mood. This museum offers a nice overview of design orientation from the late 19th century to our days, with items the elders among us easily",
          "It is not a big museum, but very interesting. You can't spend a day to visit it, but there are lot of interesting pieces. I.e there has been 132 chairs from 1700 till today. In the Rosa Hall, there has been some Art Nouveau pieces, from Gall\u00e9, Daum, Tiffany.",

          "This is a nice way to spend a couple hours on an afternoon - everything from furniture to fashion to home goods. A great perspective on the world of design and craft, and a good reminder of the Scandinavian influence in so many areas.",
          "My wife, baby and I visited here in August. I was particularly interested in the permanent display showing product design. It was a pretty good collection, but there was little or no information. I found. There's some temporary exhibitions (the one on Evil Design was ok), but",

          "Spent a couple hours here because we had free entry with a ticket we had bought earlier to another museum. If you enjoy Scandinavian design ( do!) you will like this museum. I particularly enjoyed the furniture and household exhibits. Definitely more interesting to adults than",
          "I have traveled to Sweden several times in the last few years and visit the Rohsska Museet each time. There is always a great exhibit going on and their permanent collection is really cool. A must see!"

        "wiki": "Escape the Day is a Swedish electronicore band from Gothenburg, formed in 2007, as Mindscape, by Sebastian Westman and Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Mindscape (2007\u20132009) ===\nEscape the Day began their journey in 2007, as Mindscape. The line-up included Sebastian Ekstrand (vocals & synths), Sebastian Jarfelt (screams), Johan Weicht (bass), Niklas Jonsson (drums), Sebastian Westman and Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock (both guitars & synths), They released a self-titled EP in 2008, which received immediate recognition over the internet and included the songs \"Derailed\" and \"As We Were Once\".\n\n\n=== Name Change (2009\u201311) ===\nAfter the departure of the screamer Sebastian Jarfelt, the band looked for a new screamer, but never found anyone suitable for their music. In the process of looking for a screamer, they recruited a vocalist, Maria Peters\u00e8n. They changed the name of the band to Escape The Day. Whilst no albums or EPs were made by this 6-member line-up, they recorded and released 10+ songs via YouTube between 2009-2011 including Turn Back Time.\nIn 2011 they recruited Jonas Jenelin as a scream vocalist, allowing them to blend their current 90s-trance influenced metal sound with their earlier metalcore style of Mindscape. They released a teaser for a new song titled Rain that featured Jenelin. However, Escape the Day went on hiatus and eventually revealed that both Maria Peters\u00e8n and Niklas Jonsson had left the band.\n\n\n=== Reunion (2012-14) ===\nEscape the Day returned in early-2012 as a 7-piece, with Angeline Stenbock on vocals and Neil Grant on drums. They remade two songs, \"Turn Back Time\" and \"As We Were Once\", which were both recorded for the video game Rock Band 3. \nIn 2013 both Stenbock and Grant were replaced with Jennifer Jarnek and Nidas Richmount respectively. This line-up released the song \"The Way I Am\". In 2014, Jarnek, Richmount and founding bassist Johan Weicht left. Weicht was replaced by Kristian Forsell. As of August 2019, Escape the Day have not recruited a replacement drummer or female vocalist.\n\n\n=== Confessions and Into Inception (2014-present) ===\nEscape the Day released the EP titled Confessions in 2014, which included a remake of their first song \"Derailed\". They released their first full album Into Inception in 2016. Before the release of their debut album, founding member Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock decided to leave the band.\nOn 31 December 2017, the band announced, through their Facebook page, that new music was on its way. On 26 February 2018, new single \"Breaking The Tide\" was released. In August, an acoustic rendition of their latest single was released, which was followed with the release of the Acoustic Sessions EP, including the acoustic version of \"Breaking The Tide\" and \"Undone\".\n\n\n== Musical Style ==\nEscape the Day's sound is similar to bands, such as Dead by April, and Amaranthe. Their sound is Melodic Metalcore, while blending Rock and Pop with electronic music. The band has described their sound as \"90's Dance-Trance scene blended with Metal and a slight touch of Rock and Pop.\"\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nSebastian Ekstrand \u2013 clean vocals, keyboards, programming (2008\u2013present)\nJonas Jenelin \u2013 unclean vocals (2012\u2013present)\nSebastian Westman \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming (2007\u2013present)\nKristian Forsell \u2013 bass guitar (2014\u2013present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nPatrick M\u00f6hlenbrock \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming (2007\u20132016)\nNiklas Jonsson \u2013 drums (2007\u20132011)\nSebastian Jarfelt \u2013 unclean vocals (2008\u20132009)\nJohan Weicht \u2013 bass guitar (2008\u20132014)\nMaria Petersen \u2013 clean vocals (2009\u20132011)\nNeil Grant \u2013 drums (2012)\nAngeline Stenbock \u2013 clean vocals (2012\u20132013)\nNidas Richmount \u2013 drums (2012\u20132013)\nJennifer Jarnek \u2013 clean vocals (2013)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nInto Inception (2016)\n\n\n==== EPs ====\nMindscape (2008)\nEscape the Day (2010)\nConfessions (2014)\nAcoustic Sessions (2018)\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nTurn Back Time (2012)\nThe Way That I Am (2013)\nA Beautiful Lie (2014)\nUndone (2015)\nLove Me Like U Do (Ellie Goulding Cover) (2015)\nBreathe (feat.

          "Very funny! Want to do it again. It was ugly, and you felt a little stupid, but the feeling you get when you solve things without help is pretty nice. Highly recommended!\n\n",

          "Maybe that's the reason didn't enjoy that much. Wasn't bad outside today but in those small rooms place is almost unbearable . This place is included with city pass and 2 of our 3 boys all under 11 did enjoy , but it's in a drab residential neighborhood. The tram from city",
          "I came there with a group of friend. We were there 7-8 people. The room was really fun and challenging. We manage to solve 4 out of 5 tasks. They have 3 rooms with 3 different themes. The staffs really nice also. Really recommended for a group of friend or team activity.",
          "Did the bank heist as a team activity and it was truly extremely fun. You work together to solve different puzzles and if you manage to make it through, you feel really good about yourself.",

          "If you have friends that are visiting from out of town and wondering what to do, I was suggest visiting this place!! The aesthetics and the environments are amazing and the puzzles are fun and logical. I would also suggest trying out the bank heist (A) if it's your first time.",
          "Great fun! As beginners at this kind og game we chose the Bank Heist, which was said to be the easiest game. Turned out to be one of the best spent hours ever. Not a dull moment! Lots of challenges and clues that required true teamwork under time pressure. Friendly staff, good",
          "Very well run escape games here and the owner really knows what he's doing. Everything is well constructed, electronic sensors every puzzle and every step of the way and statistically recorded. Even the photo session at the end is automatically posted. All the games were super",
          "We booked in advance on the website for a session for the bank heist. The enigma is very immersive and complex but no room for spoilers here! At the end you can have a group picture and picture available on the website or Facebook page. Good place to have fun with friends.",

          "I've played many escape games in other cities, and they were quite satisfying. But these games were far more superior in terms of engineering and complexity. The level of difficulty was handled well, and the puzzled progressed appropriately. Along with the intriguing background",

          "Visited as a group of just 2. There are many rooms to choose from, we chose Bank Heist A. Was extremely good fun and well worth the price of 380 SEK. The staff were extremely friendly, with free drinks and snacks on completion. Would strongly encourage anyone visiting Gothenburg",

          "Found this on Trip Advisor when we had some time to kill in Gothenburg. I had seen the concept on TV about a year previously and was very unsure but persuaded by my daughter we decided to give it a go. The staff were excellent and gave us complete instructions in English and",

          "This was our first \"live\" escape game and it was all I had hoped for and more! It was creative, fun and you really automatically start working as a team and it feels like it actually is for real. Instead of using your tablet of smart phone for these games - take it to the next"

        "wiki": "The SS Gothenburg was a steamship that operated along the British and then later the Australian and New Zealand coastlines. In February 1875, Gothenburg left Darwin, Australia and while en route to Adelaide it encountered a cyclone-strength storm off the north Queensland coast. The ship was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef north-west of Holbourne Island on 24 February 1875. Survivors in one of the lifeboats were rescued two days later by Leichhardt, while the occupants of two other lifeboats that managed to reach Holbourne Island were rescued several days later. Twenty-two men survived, while between 98 and 112 others died, including a number of high-profile civil servants and dignitaries.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nGothenburg was built 1855 at Lungley's building yards in Millwall, Essex. The vessel was 501-tons, 197 feet long, with a 120-horsepower (89 kW), coal-burning engine. Records at the time described Gothenburg as barquentine rigged, with its funnel set well aft between the main and mizzen masts and was fitted with four lifeboats, two port and two starboard.Gothenburg was launched stern-first on 1 April 1854. Although on launching it collided with the steamship Clyde, which sank in the River Thames. Gothenburg was severely damaged at the stern, including extensive propeller damage.The North of Europe Steam Navigation Company, operated her between Irongate Wharf, near the Tower of London, and Sweden.  In 1857, she was acquired by the Union Castle Line and renamed as RMS Celt.  In June 1862, McMerkan, Blackwood and Co. of Melbourne purchased her for the Australian trade and in that year she made a protracted voyage from England to Australia by sail. She was one of the most modern vessels working around the Australian coastline in the 1860s, and became a popular ship as she was considered reliable. After many years on the Australia-New Zealand run, her owners transferred her to the Australian coastal service.In 1873, she was lengthened and refitted in Adelaide to enable longer distances under steam and greater passenger and cargo capacity.  Following her modifications, her name reverted once again to Gothenburg.\n\nIn November 1874, several shipowners were contracted for two years from the South Australian government to provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin. Port Darwin was feeling the effects of a gold rush at Pine Creek and growing quickly as a trade post with the Dutch East Indies. However, all the local banks sent their money, together with government paperwork and the Royal Mail, around the east coast to Adelaide. On successful completion of each voyage, the South Australian government would pay the owners \u00a31000 sterling.\nWhen Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce was under orders to make best possible speed. Pearce had been her captain on the Adelaide-Darwin run for some time and had built up a solid reputation. He was a man of the sea, a man of sobriety and kindness and was well respected by his fellow sea captains.\n\nAmongst the approximately 98 passengers and 37 crew (surviving records vary) were government officials, circuit court judges, Darwin residents taking their first furlough and miners. Also aboard was the French Vice Consul Edouard Durand and James Millner, the medical officer in George W. Goyder's 1869 expedition to found the first colony at Port Darwin. There were also several prisoners aboard, bound for the Adelaide jail. Locked in the Captain's cabin was approximately 93 kilograms (3,000 ozt) of gold valued at \u00a340,000 consigned to the ES&A Bank in Adelaide. (approx US$2.6 million in 2008). Durand reportedly also carried a tin box with him containing gold sovereigns and coins worth in excess of \u00a33,000.In three days of fine weather, Gothenburg travelled 1,500 kilometres (900 mi) from Palmerston (Darwin) to Somerset on Cape York. The weather began to worsen so the ship stopped to take on ballast at Somerset. While she was anchored, conditions deteriorated to a point where both anchor chains parted. After the loss of the anchors, Gothenburg was forced to prematurely steam out 13 kilometres (7.0 nmi) because of strong currents; at that point, she brought up for the night.Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown at about 2:00 pm. The wind and rain severely increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread their way through a number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.\n\n\n== Shipwreck ==\n\nOn the evening of 24 February 1875, the ship was still heading south in almost cyclonic conditions with fore, top and mainsails set and the steam engines running at full speed. Flooding rains lashed the entire Queensland coast and Captain Pearce reportedly could not see land or sun. At approximately 7:00 pm, and for reasons undetermined, he altered course and shortly afterwards, at full speed (11 to 12 knots), hit a section of the Great Barrier Reef at low tide 31 miles (50 km) north west of Holbourne Island. Gothenburg struck with such force that she was left high up on the reef. Immediately, an order came out to lower the sails. At first, there was no panic and many passengers returned to their cabin bunks expecting Gothenburg would come off the reef at high tide.In an attempt to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be lightened forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal attempt was made to refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.\n\nThe storm made launching the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00 am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern one of the boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to pull up to the ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.At about 3:30 am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg continued to heel over. The deck became so steep that passengers and crew had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00 am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind side of the ship being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.\n\nThose still on board Gothenburg tried to cling to the rigging, but throughout the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling to let go of their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\nBy morning of the 25 February, only the masts were visible protruding from the water, with 14 people clinging to the rigging, where they remained for the next twenty four hours in cyclonic weather. At low tide, Gothenburg sank stern first and the wreck fell apart. However, the remaining starboard lifeboat, which had capsized, was still held by her painter and the rope attached by Cleland. At first light on 26 February the weather eased and the survivors managed to right the boat and bail it out; they prepared a makeshift sail and paddled for the mainland. About seven hours later they realised they could not make mainland, so they altered course for an island that could be seen in the distance. When they arrived, they were met by four of the crew from one of the port lifeboats. Their lifeboat had been severely damaged on the rocks on the opposite side of the island in an attempt to land there the day before.\n\nThe other port lifeboat, with four crew on board, was picked up by the steamer Leichhardt at an island at the entrance to Whitsunday Passage. The steamer immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30 pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; the funnel was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardt's Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but nothing other than her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors until last light and then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.At Holbourne Island, the other 18 survivors were living off raw bird's eggs and rain water that had pooled in the island rocks. Because rescue was uncertain, they engraved ship details and their names on the concave side of a large turtle shell, in the hope that it would be found in the future. On Sunday, 28 February 15 of them set off in the starboard lifeboat for an island about 20 miles away to the south, which appeared to be closer to the main shipping lane. A rescue ship, sent looking for survivors, picked up the group and took them safely to Bowen. Another rescue ship, Bunyip from Townsville, subsequently returned to Holbourne Island and rescued the three remaining survivors.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAlthough reports vary, records show that between 98 and 112 people drowned. Most records state the death toll at 102. Only 22 people survived (12 crew and 10 passengers). All 25 women and children aboard and all the officers died.\n\nEdward W. Price, Magistrate and Commissioner Circuit Court of the Northern Territory, who remained behind in Darwin, lost his wife and six children. Devastated by the news, he was given six months leave on full pay by the government. The retired fifth Premier of South Australia, Thomas Reynolds and his wife, Anne, both drowned as did Eduard Durand, the French Vice Consul.Other notable passengers who died were Dr James Millner and his family, Justice William A. Wearing QC, Circuit Court Judge; Joseph Whitby, acting South Australian Crown Solicitor; Richard Wells, NT Times & Gazette editor; Lionel Pelham, a senior public servant; Commander Andrew Ross of the Royal Navy; C. J. Lyons, Justice Wearing's senior assistant; William Shoobridge, Secretary to several mining companies; A. L. McKay, Government Surveyor; and several Overland Telegraph employees.Never before in Australian history had so many high-profile public servants, dignitaries and diplomats died in a single tragedy. Many passengers who died were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, reportedly taking several years to recover. Most of Gothenburg's crew were from Melbourne and as a result of the shipwreck, 11 widows and 34 children were left destitute in Victoria.At Bowen, twelve survivors left with Captain Lake on the ship Victoria headed for Sydney. They all got free passage from McMerkan, Blackwood and Co, the owners of Gothenburg. The four survivors from the second port lifeboat that were picked up by the steamer Leichhardt, remained with that ship and subsequently made way for Brisbane.\n\nTwo weeks later a hard-hat diver, sent down to recover the gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women at the foot of the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of hair or some other personal item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.There were three heroes identified that tragic night, all attested to by all the other survivors, for their attempts to save other passengers. In recognition of their bravery, on 26 July 1875, the Governor of South Australia, Sir Anthony Musgrave, presented passengers James Fitzgerald and John Cleland and crewman Robert Brazil with gold medals and a gold watch. The Gothenburg Relief Fund Committee also presented each of them with a gold chain.\n\n\n=== Report ===\nThe report of the Marine Board of Queensland determined that: the loss of the Gothenburg may in a great measure be attributed to an unexpected offset seawards, caused by heavy floods in the Burdekin and other rivers discharging themselves into the sea at that portion of the coast; at the same time they do not consider that due caution was observed in the navigation of the vessel, as they are of the opinion that some attempt should have been made to sight Cape Bowling Green Lighthouse, or Cape Upstart, and, failing that, that the lead should have been used, which, on this part of the coast, is a sufficient guide for keeping clear of the Barrier; a vessel carrying a depth not exceeding 15 fathoms (27 m) or 16 fathoms (29 m) being well clear of that danger, while a less depth would show an approach to the shore of the mainland.\n\n\n=== Lifeboats ===\nThere was also much speculation at the time in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburg's passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nToday, only parts of the deteriorated iron hull and the coal fired square boilers of Gothenburg remain. The wreck lies between 9 and approximately 16 metres (52 ft) of water on the western side of Old Reef, 130 kilometres (81 mi) southeast of Townsville. The Gothenburg shipwreck is registered on the Queensland National Estate (place ID #8923) as a Heritage site, and is protected under Section 7 of the (Commonwealth) Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, which requires that divers have a permit to enter the 200m protected zone that has been declared around the wreck. Its official location is: Old Reef, Great Barrier Reef, 75 kilometres (47 mi) north-east of Ayr, at 19\u00b022\u203206\u2033S 148\u00b003\u203221\u2033E. The reef around the wreck provides good diving with an extensive coral garden. A strict non-disturbance policy applies to marine flora and fauna as well as to the fabric of the wreck. Pelagic fish and reef sharks are common.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\nThe northern Darwin suburb of Millner was named after Dr James Millner who, together with his family, lost their lives on Gothenburg. Most streets in the northern Darwin suburb of Coconut Grove and some in the adjacent suburb of Millner, were named after local Darwin residents, interstate visitors and crew who lost their lives during the shipwreck. Gothenburg Crescent, in the inner Darwin suburb of Stuart Park, was named after the ship.The large turtle shell, which was engraved by the 18 survivors at Holbourne Island, is displayed at the South Australian Museum, on North Terrace in Adelaide.\n\n\n== Survivors ==\nIn 1875, a detailed list of all passengers and crew was published by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, albeit with several errors and spelling mistakes. That document was used as the main source of the following survivors' table.\nThe survivors' surnames have been reconciled against rescue ships' log books, other records and a photo of the engraved turtle shell. Known discrepancies have been clarified, where possible, in the comments section.\n\n\n=== Survivors ===\n\n\n=== Full known passenger list ===\n\n\n=== Full known crew list ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of disasters in Australia by death toll \u2013 Wikipedia list article\nList of shipwrecks of Australia \u2013 Wikipedia list article\nTimeline of Australian history\nHistoric Shipwrecks Act 1976#Historic shipwreck protected zones\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "A water taxi or a water bus, also known as a sightseeing boat, is a watercraft used to provide public or private transport, usually, but not always, in an urban environment. Service may be scheduled with multiple stops, operating in a similar manner to a bus, or on demand to many locations, operating in a similar manner to a taxi. A boat service shuttling between two points would normally be described as a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.\nThe term water taxi is usually confined to a boat operating on demand, and water bus to a boat operating on a schedule. In North American usage, the terms are roughly synonymous.\nThe earliest water taxi service was recorded as operating around the area that became Manchester, United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nCities and other places operating water buses and/or taxis include:\n\nAlexandria, Virginia\nAmsterdam\nAuckland\nBahrain\nBaltimore\nBaltimore Water Taxi\nBangkok\nChao Phraya Express Boat\nKhlong Saen Saep boat service\nBordeaux\nBoats BatCub\nBoston\nBratislava\nBratislava Propeler \nBremen\nBrisbane\nCityCat\nCityFerry\nBristol\nBristol Ferry Boats\nBrunei\nBucharest\nBudapest\nBuenos Aires, Tigre\nBydgoszcz, Poland\nCardiff\nCardiff Waterbus\nCap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti (at Labadee beach)\nCape Town\nCaye Caulker\nCharleston\nChicago\nCopenhagen\nCopenhagen Harbour Buses\nDavao City\nDavao water taxi service\nDhaka\nBuriganga River water bus\nHatirjheel water taxi\nDubai\nAbras\nRTA water taxis (recently introduced)\nErie, Pennsylvania\nPresque Isle Water Taxi\nFort Lauderdale\nGal\u00e1pagos Islands\nGothenburg\n\u00c4lvsnabben ferry\nPaddan\nGuangzhou, China\nHalifax Regional Municipality\nHamburg\nHADAG\nHelsinki\nHo Chi Minh City\nHong Kong: Cheung Chau, Chi Ma Wan, Peng Chau, Silvermine Bay\nNew World First Ferry\nIstanbul\nJacksonville, Florida\nJacksonville Water Taxi\nKarachi\nKobe\nKochi\nKrager\u00f8 and surrounding area, Norway\nKristiansund, Norway\nLake Ozark, Missouri\nLaughlin, Nevada and Bullhead City, Arizona\nLeeds\nLisbon\nLondon\nLondon River Services\nThames Clippers\nLong Beach, California\nLong Beach Transit\nMalta\nDghajsa\nManila\nPasig River Ferry Service\nMoscow (River tram)\nMumbai (Catamarans and ferries)\nNantes\nNavibus\nNational Harbor, Maryland\nNew York City\nLiberty Water Taxi\nNew York Water Taxi\nNYC Ferry\nNew Orleans - Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Mississippi River from mouth to Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Belle Chasse Marine, Port Ship Service, Crescent Ship Service and Weber Marine.\nNew Zealand\nNiigata\nNur-Sultan\nOklahoma City\nOrlando, Florida\nOsaka\nOsaka Suij\u014d Bus\nOslo\nNBDS\nOslo-Fergene\nPanama\nParis\nVogu\u00e9oPotsdam, Germany\nQuad Cities, Illinois/Iowa\nRotterdam/Dordrecht\nSacramento\nSan Mart\u00edn de los Andes\nSaint Petersburg\nAquabus\nSeattle\nKing County Water Taxi\nSeoul\nSha Lo Wan, Tai O, Tuen Mun, Tung Chung (Urmston Road, Hong Kong)\nShizuoka\nSingapore (Singapore River)\nSpalding (River Welland)\nStockholm\nSydney\nTallinn\nTampa\nTimi\u0219oara\nTokyo\nTokyo Cruise Ship\nTokyo Mizube Line\nToronto\nToronto water taxis\nTrinidad\nUnited Kingdom\nMersey Ferry\nPlymouth\nWater Taxi Service, Port of Spain to San Fernando \u2013 service implemented in December 2008\u2022    Trogir\n\nPittsburghPortland, Maine\u2022Salmaris Water Taxi Trogir\n\nVictoria, British Columbia\nVictoria Harbour\nWalt Disney World\nVancouver\nThe Aquabus\nCoastal Link Ferries\nEnglish Bay Launch\nFalse Creek Ferries\nGranville Island Water Taxi Services (defunct)\nSeaBus\nVenice\nGondola\nVaporetto\nWellington\nFerries in Wellington\nWinnipeg\nXochimilco, Mexico City\nChalupa\nYokohama\nKeihin Ferry Boat\nThe Port ServiceOn demand water taxis are also commonly found in marinas, harbours and cottage areas, providing access to boats and waterfront properties that are not directly accessible by land.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn March 6, 2004, a water taxi on the Seaport Taxi service operated by the Living Classrooms Foundation capsized during a storm on the Patapsco River, near Baltimore's Inner Harbor.

          "This tour is a great introduction to the city. A mix of humor and history, you get a view of the central district from the canals that cut through the heart of the city. The tour passes city parks, classic stone buildings, and under dozens of bridges, some so low you must duck",
          "Did a Padden Tour on our recent trip to Gothenburg and would highly recommend. Great way to see the sights and enjoy the canals and bridges. Very informative (and funny) guide Oscar! Thank you",
          "a short boat trip which goes around the canals and into the sea at a steady rate, he English is good but clearly more is said to the Swedish guests. All quite interesting and fair opportunity to take photos. Relatively expensive for the length of the trip but glad we did it",
          "We went on our Paddan Tour during a rainy Saturday morning. Luckily most of the rain had stopped by our tour time and they provided panchos for us to wear. Freda and Oscar were our pilot/tour guide and they did a great job! Oscar was very informative and funny and Freda did a",
          "I knew almost nothing about Gothenburg when I got on the comfortable boat, and a lot more when I got off 50 minutes later. The guide spoke in Swedish and repeated everything in clear English. It was a very pleasurable way to spend an hour.",
          "We arrived in Gotheburg and not sure how to approach the city we opted for the canal tour to give us a view from the waterways. It was a well informed trip with a very affable guide providing an insight to the history of the city. Who knew that the Swedes ate so many bananas!",
          "Great way of seeing Gothenburg. You get a view of the center of town from the canals, and then it goes out on the Gota river, and you get a really nice overview. The guide did a great job. We saw interesting buildings, cranes, ships. Not cheap, but great to just sit down and see",
          "I have easily went with Paddan fifty times. Since I was a kid to have my own kids. The guides and the boats give a different perspective and also a strong reminder that Gothenburg is founded in clay and marsh. Fun and interesting. Always brings my guests to a ride with Paddan.",
          "My husband and I purchased tickets for a boat tour in September 2017. We got our tickets directly from the dock from which the boats depart, and arranged to take the last tour of the day at 5pm. The boat is open, so be prepared to be exposed to the elements (i.e., sun and",
          "The tour was very good fun. The guide was informative and amusing, the commentary was given in both English and Swedish. We were advised at the kiosk that we would have to duck under some bridges due to high water levels ,also that due to winds we might get wet. We in fact had",
          "We were sceptical about this being a tourist trap but it was actually excellent. The guides are great and the tour is in two languages - Swedish and English. You cover quite a bit of ground (well, water) and we learned things about Gothenburg we would have missed if we hadn't",
          "A nice way to see the city and hear some of the history. The guide spoke great english and the tour was enjoyable. Good value for money, the tour is about 50 minutes long. Due to the high water levels, for one of the bridges that is really low you have to get on the floor at one",
          "Our Swedish friends took us on this boat tour around Gothenburg whilst visiting them, the tour was very informative and we learned a lot about the city even our friends that live in Sweden learned new stuff about Gothenburg. The guide was very good and spoke excellent English.",

          "This sightseeing tour is a MUST for all new visitors to Gothenburg. To travel through the canal, into the harbour going under many bridges, the last of which is so low it has everyone on the floor is simply a fantastic way to see the sights of Gothenburg. The fguide we had at",
          "This is a nice way of sightseeing in Gothenburg. One gets a good picture of the city and the tour guides are sometimes hilarious!",
          "This is a good activity for tourist in Goteborg. Once in a while for the locals as well. Better pick a day without rain, since it can get rather wet sitting in an open boat. The guides I have heard are really good",
          "50 minutes with boat. Excellent! :-) Try to do this in good weather. The guide we had was very good and funny",
          "Took two 15 year olds on the ride. It was a bit of a drag to get them there but at the end of the ride they both said they thought that was fun. Good tour guide, perfect route, easy to buy tickets, nice boat, good enough price and perfect time allocation. I would certainly like",
          "We all enjoyed this although ducking under the low bridges could be difficult for some people. Also it wasn't just flat canals it went out into the dock area. Wear a mac as you can get splashed. More wet at the front of the boat.",
          "The canal tour is a great way to explore Gothenburg. Even for locals. And interesting and fun facts are told by the guide. They also have a river tour on S\u00e4ve\u00e5n. Called Gothenburg Amazonas. Lush scenary and birdlife. Only swedish guide. But worth a ride.",
          "I suggest you to do this guided trip as your first thing in G\u00f6teborg. You will get a good overview of the city and can pick out things you would like to see more of. The guide we had had a lovely sense of humor, typical G\u00f6teborgshumor, and it was long time since I laughed so",
          "If the weather allows it, this boat trip is very recommended. The length of the trip is very appropriate, 50 min., and the journey it is very informative and interesting. You can experience Gothenburg in a different way.",
          "It was a very warm day and the only day we were able to do sightseeing, it is a perfect way to learn a bit about the history of the city and see some of the main sights. The tour guide was great, spoke fluent English & Swedish and knew her information.",
          "This canal trip was included as part of our coach tour of Gothenberg. The boat is quite large and it became obvious during the cruise why it is completely open - we needed to lower our heads to safely get under some of the canal bridges, which are extremely low! The tour",
          "Have been on a few here and there, but this one was the best so far. Not some grainy recording you struggle to hear, but an enthusiastic guide who speaks both Swedish and English. The scenery may be ho-hum to some, but it's a nice, relaxing way to give your feet a rest!",
          "My family of five really enjoyed this 50 minute boat trip through Gothenburg! Our guide was funny and the information really interesting. Very good for relaxing while enjoying the sights and learning new things after a long walk through the city :)",
          "Spent 50 mins or so doing the Paddan boat tour, and although it was fine it wasn't overly interesting. There just isn't that much to see unfortunately. Our guide was very friendly though.",
          "It's a nice way to relax and learn a little about the city. You duck under some bridges and pass the yard that built ships area and military ship no longer in use. You see the Gardens and the different neighborhoods from afar.",
          "This is a must do on a visit to Gothenburg. The tour takes you along the canals, moat and river in a circuit giving a good introduction to the history and geography of the city. The guides alternate Swedish and English commentary. There are a lot of low bridges, one of which (",
          "We live in Gothenburg, but still enjoy going for this tour on a sunny day. Every tour guide will have their own variant of the tour, where you will learn some things about the city. You will go under a lot of bridges, whereof one (The hair dresser) is the lowest - where you",

          "Boats are much nicer than buses for city sightseeing! Guides are usually well prepared and - as expected in Gothenburg - witty. But maybe it is better to take the tour later in the summer. Some of the guides are not that knowledgeable or on the ball early in the season. Some",

          "First, I was not sure whether to go or not. The sky was totally dark (heavy clouds) and it was obvious it would start raining soon. Despite that I joined the Paddan tour and I certainly did not regret! It was one of the best things we did in Gothenburg! The boat trip on the",

        "wiki": "Gunnebo House (Swedish: Gunnebo slott) is a mansion located outside Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal Municipality, Sweden.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe estate consists of a main building from the end of the 18th century, built by merchant John Hall, and drawn by city architect Carl Wilhelm Carlberg in a Neoclassical architecture. All drawings and design plans are kept and through these, reconstructions and renovations of buildings and gardens are undergoing since the 1990s. Today, Gunnebo is one of Sweden's most complete 18th century estates.  \nAfter the death of Jon Hall in 1802, the House went to his son John Hall Junior. The son lost the family's trading business due to the recession during the Napoleonic wars and the family sold Gunnebo and all furnishings. The last private owner, baroness Hilda Sparre, died in 1948. The 18th century interior was recreated in the 1950s, when M\u00f6lndal Municipality bought the estate. Several original furniture have been brought back to Gunnebo during the 20th century. Today the House is a museum and a recreated 18th century home. \nGunnebo has one of Sweden's finest and best preserved baroque gardens. Surrounding these is a landscape garden between the lakes Stensj\u00f6n and R\u00e5dasj\u00f6n. The estate is a cultural reserve since 2003 and the main building is listed since 1963. \n\n\n=== Notable guests ===\nBoth king Gustav III of Sweden and Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France visited the Hall family at Gunnebo. They also welcomed the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda. King Gustav V visited Hilda Sparre at the House in the early 20th century. \nIn June 2001 guests of the EU-summit in Gothenburg, among whom U.S. President George W Bush, visited Gunnebo House.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe parks are open to the public and the interior of the House can be seen with a guided tour. Guided tours are offered for visitors the year around and there is also a shop and a restaurant. Every summer, an open-air theatre is held in the gardens.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nGunnebo House and Gardens, swedishgardens.se",

Hence not a real castle since no royalty ever lived there, but reportedly Gustav the III visited on one occasion. Sometimes they arrange activities for children",
          "The manor house was closed the day I visited with a friend (who drove us there), but the grounds were simply beautiful. In early June the rhododendron were in full bloom, plus there are wonderfully kept formal gardens. The place is peaceful and calming and a terrific spot to",
          "I love to walk there,you can even find a big lake there.Wonderful place and nature close to the city.",
          "I have not visited the actual palace, but the whole ground is a very beautiful and relaxing place, with nice view of the lake. The orchards where they grow the outstanding food served in the restaurant are beautiful, and so is the craft shop (although prices are a bit high). But",
          "If you have some extra days Gunnebo slott (it's a tiny not very interesting castle) and park is a nice excursion. Nothing really spectacular especially not compared to British castles and parks. The food, however is well prepared and nice..",
          "Firstly, from the bus stop, it was a good walk, about 15-20 minutes, to arrive at Gunnebo (which strikes us as more of a mansion than a palace, in name). I mention the walk in case you take public transit and are not a walker. The mansion itself and the garden grounds are truly",
          "During the year its free walking around enjoying nature. The park is well-kept and here is much free space for playing or just relax. When you get hungry here is also a resturang open dag time. Very tasty food \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We went for a walk in the garden last day of our visit on the way to the airport. We have not been in the Castle but it is worth to walk around. Nice relaxing place.",
          "This castle south of Gothenburg has well designed flower and vegetable gardens. The castle itself is not interesting. But the glass house, stables and gardens are well worth a visit. Nice venue in late spring or early summer. Large parking space.",
          "You can get here by bus from G\u00f6teborg, from the bus stop you walk about 15 minutes to the house through beautiful surroundings. We took a guided tour of the house, which was interesting. The vegetable and flower beds around the house are great and the area also offers hiking",
          "Visit the manor house for a guidef tour (pls, see opening hours :) take a walk in the scenic surroundins and finalise with a visit at the lovely cafe (or maybe at the restaurant). Opening hours at the restaurant: check the web site or call them. A bit expensive at the restaurant",
          "Quite nice garden, particularly the vegetable and flower beds. Also a good place to enjoy an excellent but pricey lunch.",
          "Definitely a lovely place to visit for a stroll around the gardens and visit to the cafe with outdoor seating in a lovely setting. The Dagens lunch price is above average, the cheese sandwich is lovely but there isn't anything for children. However the cakes are to die for",

          "Swedish ideas of castles and palaces are not what we expect in English. Gunnebo is a gorgeous country home with lovely gardens, house and a nice restaurant/cafe. If you are in the area and the weather is nice then this is well worth the trip.",
          "Be aware that your normal Gothenburg transit card will NOT get you here. You need the Gothenburg+ card. Otherwise you will ride the tram all the way to Molndal, only to be told by the friendly driver on bus #753 that your card is not valid for that zone, and the only way to buy",
          "We came on a winter's night and could not see the approach or the landscape clearly. However, once inside, it was warm and beautifully kept. The story of Gunnebo and the John Hall family was beautifully brought out by a young guide. Impressed at how painstakingly this palace",
          "It may not be the largest Manor House in Sweden, but it's history is fascinating, the interiors special and the symmetry in it's architecture remarkable. We were guide around on a day when they offer the \"haunted\" version out the tour, and is nice to see how well this can still",
          "The gardens were pretty and well manicured. We went on the house tour but there was no English speaking tours which was a bit disappointing especially if you a paying 85 Kroners. An English booklet was given but it would not be the same. Nevertheless still worth it.",
          "I Came manly for the gardens and not the inside of the sl\u00f6tt so was impressed to see the kitchen garden in a well laid out manner. The Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdsm\u00e4stre's Buff\u00e9. Was less impressive however. The offering was not as impressive as I envisaged and there was way to many people crammed",

          "I visited Gunnebo last year after a big hike in the nature. It is a nice country house, wonderfully Nordic and simple. I was a bit disappointed after having lived in Germany for years and having seen many castles and palaces there. Compared to them Gunnebo is very small and",
          "After taking your grandchildren to the M\u00f6lndal Museum, drive along to this beautiful country house. It's not likely that you will be permitted to visit the building. But a walk through the garden, and perhaps a snack the natural/ecological cottage would round out the day",
          "I have never been inside the palace, only visited the gardens which are amazing. Have also been there for a Christmas market, which was a lovely experience (but very crowded). Can clearly recommend a picnic or something here in the summer."

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum. On 29 December 2004, the Museum of World Culture opened near Korsv\u00e4gen. Museums include the Gothenburg Museum of Art, and several museums of sea and navigation history, natural history, the sciences, and East India. Aeroseum, close to the G\u00f6teborg City Airport, is an aircraft museum in a former military underground air force base. The Volvo museum has exhibits of the history of Volvo and the development from 1927 until today. Products shown include cars, trucks, marine engines, and buses.Universeum is a public science centre that opened in 2001, the largest of its kind in Scandinavia. It is divided into six sections, each containing experimental workshops and a collection of reptiles, fish, and insects. Universeum occasionally host debates between Swedish secondary-school students and Nobel Prize laureates or other scholars.\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThe most noted attraction is the amusement park Liseberg, located in the central part of the city. It is the largest amusement park in Scandinavia by number of rides, and was chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes. It is the most popular attraction in Sweden by number of visitors per year (more than 3 million).There are a number of independent theatre ensembles in the city, besides institutions such as Gothenburg City Theatre, Backa Theatre (youth theatre), and Folkteatern.The main boulevard is called Kungsportsavenyn (commonly known as Avenyn, \"The Avenue\"). It is about 1 km (0.6 mi) long and starts at G\u00f6taplatsen \u2013 which is the location of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, the city's theatre, and the city library, as well as the concert hall \u2013 and stretches all the way to Kungsportsplatsen in the old city centre of Gothenburg, crossing a canal and a small park. The Avenyn was created in the 1860s and 1870s as a result of an international architecture contest, and is the product of a period of extensive town planning and remodelling.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies. The blue-collar industries which have dominated the city for long are still important factors in the city's economy, but they are being gradually replaced by high-tech industries.Banking and finance are also important, as well as the event and tourist industry.Gothenburg is the terminus of the Valdemar-G\u00f6teborg gas pipeline, which brings natural gas from the North Sea fields to Sweden, through Denmark.Historically, Gothenburg was home base from the 18th century of the Swedish East India Company. From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

        "wiki": "Gothenburg ( (listen); abbreviated Gbg; Swedish: G\u00f6teborg [j\u0153t\u025b\u02c8b\u0254rj] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Sweden, fifth-largest in the Nordic countries, and capital of the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County. It is situated by Kattegat, on the west coast of Sweden, and has a population of approximately 570,000 in the city proper and about 1 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area.Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries.Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927. The original parent Volvo Group and the now separate Volvo Car Corporation are still headquartered on the island of Hisingen in the city. Other key companies are SKF and Astra Zeneca.\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport 30 km (19 mi) southeast of the city center. The smaller G\u00f6teborg City Airport, 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center, was closed to regular airline traffic in 2015.\nThe city hosts the Gothia Cup, the world's largest youth football tournament, and the G\u00f6teborg Basketball Festival, Europe's largest youth basketball tournament, alongside some of the largest annual events in Scandinavia. The Gothenburg Film Festival, held in January since 1979, is the leading Scandinavian film festival with over 155,000 visitors each year. In summer, a wide variety of music festivals are held in the city, including the popular Way Out West Festival.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe city was named G\u00f6teborg in the city's charter in 1621 and simultaneously given the German and English name Gothenburg. The Swedish name was given after the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, called G\u00f6ta River in English, and other cities ending in -borg.Both the Swedish and German/English names were in use before 1621 and had already been used for the previous city founded in 1604 and burned down in 1611. Gothenburg is one of few Swedish cities to still have an official and widely used exonym. Another example is the province of Scania in southern Sweden.\nThe city council of 1641 consisted of four Swedish, three Dutch, three German, and two Scottish members. In Dutch, Scots, English, and German, all languages with a long history in this trade and maritime-oriented city, the name Gothenburg is or was (in the case of German) used for the city. Variations of the official German/English name Gothenburg in the city's 1621 charter existed or exist in many languages. The French form of the city name is Gothembourg, but in French texts, the Swedish name G\u00f6teborg is more frequent. \"Gothenburg\" can also be seen in some older English texts. In Spanish and Portuguese the city is called Gotemburgo. These traditional forms are sometimes replaced with the use of the Swedish G\u00f6teborg, for example by The G\u00f6teborg Opera and the G\u00f6teborg Ballet. However, G\u00f6teborgs universitet, previously designated as the G\u00f6teborg University in English, changed its name to the University of Gothenburg in 2008. The Gothenburg municipality has also reverted to the use of the English name in international contexts.In 2009, the city council launched a new logotype for Gothenburg. Since the name \"G\u00f6teborg\" contains the Swedish letter \"\u00f6\", they planned to make the name more international and \"up to date\" by turning the \"\u00f6\" sideways. As of 2015, the name is spelled \"Go:teborg\" on a large number of signs in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early modern period, the configuration of Sweden's borders made Gothenburg strategically critical as the only Swedish gateway to Skagerrak, the North Sea and Atlantic, situated on the west coast in a very narrow strip of Swedish territory between Danish Halland in the south and Norwegian Bohusl\u00e4n in the north. After several failed attempts, Gothenburg was successfully founded in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus (Gustaf II Adolf).The site of the first church built in Gothenburg, subsequently destroyed by Danish invaders, is marked by a stone near the north end of the \u00c4lvsborg Bridge in the F\u00e4rjen\u00e4s Park. The church was built in 1603 and destroyed in 1611. The city was heavily influenced by the Dutch, Germans, and Scots, and Dutch planners and engineers were contracted to construct the city as they had the skills needed to drain and build in the marshy areas chosen for the city. The town was designed like Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Batavia (Jakarta) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan). The planning of the streets and canals of Gothenburg closely resembled that of Jakarta, which was built by the Dutch around the same time. The Dutchmen initially won political power, and it was not until 1652, when the last Dutch politician in the city's council died, that Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg. During the Dutch period, the town followed Dutch town laws and Dutch was proposed as the official language in the town. Robust city walls were built during the 17th century. In 1807, a decision was made to tear down most of the city's wall. The work started in 1810 and was carried out by 150 soldiers from the Bohus regiment.Along with the Dutch, the town also was heavily influenced by Scots who settled down in Gothenburg. Many became people of high-profile. William Chalmers, the son of a Scottish immigrant, donated his fortunes to set up what later became the Chalmers University of Technology. In 1841, the Scotsman Alexander Keiller founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company that was in business until 1989. His son James Keiller donated Keiller Park to the city in 1906.The Gothenburg coat of arms was based on the lion of the coat of arms of Sweden, symbolically holding a shield with the national emblem, the Three Crowns, to defend the city against its enemies.In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark\u2013Norway ceded the then Danish province Halland, in the south, and the Norwegian province of Bohus County or Bohusl\u00e4n in the north, leaving Gothenburg less exposed. Gothenburg was able to grow into a significant port and trade centre on the west coast, because it was the only city on the west coast that, along with Marstrand, was granted the rights to trade with merchants from other countries.In the 18th century, fishing was the most important industry. However, in 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded, and the city flourished due to its foreign trade with highly profitable commercial expeditions to China.The harbour developed into Sweden's main harbour for trade towards the west, and when Swedish emigration to the United States increased, Gothenburg became Sweden's main point of departure for these travellers. The impact of Gothenburg as a main port of embarkation for Swedish emigrants is reflected by Gothenburg, Nebraska, a small Swedish settlement in the United States.With the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800) to 130,000 (1900).  In the 20th century, major companies that developed included SKF (1907) and Volvo (1927).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nGothenburg is located on the west coast, in southwestern Sweden, about halfway between the capitals Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway. The location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, which feeds into Kattegatt, an arm of the North Sea, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. The archipelago of Gothenburg consists of rough, barren rocks and cliffs, which also is typical for the coast of Bohusl\u00e4n. Due to the Gulf Stream, the city has a mild climate and moderately heavy precipitation. It is the second-largest city in Sweden after the capital Stockholm.The Gothenburg Metropolitan Area (Stor-G\u00f6teborg) has 982,360 inhabitants and extends to the municipalities of Ale, Alings\u00e5s, G\u00f6teborg, H\u00e4rryda, Kung\u00e4lv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, M\u00f6lndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tj\u00f6rn, \u00d6cker\u00f6 within V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, and Kungsbacka within Halland County.Angered, a suburb outside Gothenburg, consists of Hj\u00e4llbo, Eriksbo, Rannebergen, Hammarkullen, G\u00e5rdsten, and L\u00f6vg\u00e4rdet. It is a Million Programme part of Gothenburg, like Roseng\u00e5rd in Malm\u00f6 and Botkyrka in Stockholm. Angered had about 50,000 inhabitants in 2015.[?] It lies north of Gothenburg and is isolated from the rest of the city. Bergsj\u00f6n is another Million Programme suburb north of Gothenburg, it has 14,000 inhabitants. Biskopsg\u00e5rden is the biggest multicultural suburb on the island of Hisingen, which is a part of Gothenburg but separated from the city by the river.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGothenburg has a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) and an oceanic climate using the -3 \u00b0C isotherm (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are quite mild throughout the year and warmer than places in similar latitude, for example, Stockholm, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream. During the summer, daylight extends 18 hours and 5 minutes, but lasts 6 hours and 32 minutes in late December. The climate has become significantly milder in later decades, particularly in summer and winter; July temperatures used to be below Stockholm's 1961\u20131990 averages, but have since been warmer than that benchmark.\nSummers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of 19 to 20 \u00b0C (66 to 68 \u00b0F) and lows of 10 to 12 \u00b0C (50 to 54 \u00b0F), but temperatures of 25\u201330 \u00b0C (77\u201386 \u00b0F) occur on many days during the summer.\nWinters are cold and windy with temperatures of around \u22123 to 3 \u00b0C (27 to 37 \u00b0F), though it rarely drops below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F). Precipitation is regular but generally moderate throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December to March, but is not unusual in November and April and can sometimes occur even in October and May, in extreme cases even in September.\n\n\n== Parks and nature ==\n\nGothenburg has several parks and nature reserves ranging in size from tens of square metres to hundreds of hectares. It also has many green areas that are not designated as parks or reserves.\nSelection of parks:\n\nKungsparken, 13 ha (32 acres), built between 1839 and 1861, surrounds the canal that circles the city centre.\nGarden Society of Gothenburg, a park and horticultural garden, is located next to Kungsportsavenyen. Founded in 1842 by the Swedish king Carl XIV Johan and on initiative of the amateur botanist Henric Elof von Normann, the park has a noted rose garden with some 4,000 roses of 1,900 cultivars.\nSlottsskogen,  137 ha (340 acres), was created in 1874 by August Kobb. It has a free \"open\" zoo that includes harbor seals, penguins, horses, pigs, deer, moose, goats, and many birds. The Natural History Museum (Naturhistoriska Museet) and the city's oldest observatory are located in the park. The annual Way Out West festival is held in the park.\n\u00c4ngg\u00e5rdsbergens naturreservat, 320 ha (790 acres), was bought in 1840 by pharmacist Arvid Gren, and donated in 1963 to the city by Sven and Carl Gren Broberg, who stated the area must remain a nature and bird reserve. It lies partly in M\u00f6lndal.\nDelsj\u00f6omr\u00e5dets naturreservat, about 760 ha (1,900 acres), has been in use since the 17th century as a farming area; significant forest management was carried out in the late 19th century. Skat\u00e5s gym and motionscentrum is situated here.\nRya Skogs Naturreservat, 17 ha (42 acres), became a protected area in 1928. It contains remnants of a defensive wall built in the mid- to late-17th century.\nKeillers park was donated by James Keiller in 1906. He was the son of Scottish Alexander Keiller, who founded the G\u00f6taverken shipbuilding company.\nS A Hedlunds park: Sven Adolf Hedlund, newspaper publisher and politician, bought the 15 ha (37 acres) Bjursl\u00e4tt farm in 1857, and in 1928 it was given to the city.\nHisingsparken is Gothenburg's largest park.\nFluns\u00e5sparken, built in 1950, has many free activities during the summer such as concerts and theatre.\nGothenburg Botanical Garden, 175 ha (430 acres), opened in 1923. It won an award in 2003, and in 2006 was third in \"The most beautiful garden in Europe\" competition. It has around 16,000 species of plants and trees. The greenhouses contain around 4,500 species including 1,600 orchids. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in Europe with three stars in the French Guide Rouge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nVery few houses are left from the 17th century when the city was founded, since all but the military and royal houses were built of wood. A rare exception is the Skansen Kronan.The first major architecturally interesting period is the 18th century when the East India Company made Gothenburg an important trade city. Imposing stone houses in Neo-Classical style were erected around the canals. One example from this period is the East India House, which today houses the G\u00f6teborg City Museum.In the 19th century, the wealthy bourgeoisie began to move outside the city walls which had protected the city. The style now was an eclectic, academic, somewhat overdecorated style which the middle-class favoured. The working class lived in the overcrowded city district Haga in wooden houses.In the 19th century, the first comprehensive town plan after the founding of city was created, which led to the construction of the main street, Kungsportsavenyen. Perhaps the most significant type of houses of the city, Landsh\u00f6vdingehusen, were built in the end of the 19th century \u2013 three-storey houses with the first floor in stone and the other two in wood.The early 20th century, characterized by the National Romantic style, was rich in architectural achievements. Masthugg Church is a noted example of the style of this period. In the early 1920s, on the city's 300th anniversary, the G\u00f6taplatsen square with its Neoclassical look was built.After this, the predominant style in Gothenburg and rest of Sweden was Functionalism which especially dominated the suburbs such as V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda and Bergsj\u00f6n. The Swedish functionalist architect Uno \u00c5hr\u00e9n served as city planner from 1932 through 1943. In the 1950s, the big stadium Ullevi was built when Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup.The modern architecture of the city has been formed by such architects as Gert Wing\u00e5rdh, who started as a Post-modernist in the 1980s.Gustaf Adolf Square is a town square located in central Gothenburg. Noted buildings on the square include Gothenburg City Hall (formerly the stock exchange, opened in 1849) and the  Nordic Classicism law court. The main canal of Gothenburg also flanks the square.\n\n\n=== Characteristic buildings ===\n\nThe Gothenburg Central Station is in the centre of the city, next to Nordstan and Drottningtorget. The building has been renovated and expanded numerous times since the grand opening in October 1858. In 2003, a major reconstruction was finished which brought the 19th-century building into the 21st century expanding the capacity for trains, travellers, and shopping. Not far from the central station is the Skanskaskrapan, or more commonly known as \"The Lipstick\". It is 86 m (282 ft) high with 22 floors and coloured in red-white stripes. The skyscraper was designed by Ralph Erskine and built by Skanska in the late 1980s as the headquarters for the company.By the shore of the G\u00f6ta \u00c4lv at Lilla Bommen is The G\u00f6teborg Opera. It was completed in 1994. The architect Jan Izikowitz was inspired by the landscape and described his vision as \"Something that makes your mind float over the squiggling landscape like the wings of a seagull.\"\n\nFeskek\u00f6rka, or Fiskhallen, is an indoor fishmarket by the Rosenlundskanalen in central Gothenburg. Feskek\u00f6rkan was opened on 1 November 1874 and its name from the building's resemblance to a Gothic church. The Gothenburg city hall is in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The Gothenburg Synagogue at Stora Nygatan, near Drottningtorget, was built in 1855 according to the designs of the German architect August Kr\u00fcger.The Gunnebo House is a country house located to the south of Gothenburg, in M\u00f6lndal. It was built in a neoclassical architecture towards the end of the 18th century. Created in the early 1900s was the Vasa Church. It is located in Vasastan and is built of granite in a neo-Romanesque style.Another noted construction is Brudaremossen TV Tower, one of the few partially guyed towers in the world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe sea, trade, and industrial history of the city are evident in the cultural life of Gothenburg. It is also a popular destination for tourists on the Swedish west coast.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMany of the cultural institutions, as well as hospitals and the university, were created by donations from rich merchants and industrialists, for example the R\u00f6hsska Museum. On 29 December 2004, the Museum of World Culture opened near Korsv\u00e4gen. Museums include the Gothenburg Museum of Art, and several museums of sea and navigation history, natural history, the sciences, and East India. Aeroseum, close to the G\u00f6teborg City Airport, is an aircraft museum in a former military underground air force base. The Volvo museum has exhibits of the history of Volvo and the development from 1927 until today.

Gothenburg port has come to be the largest harbour in Scandinavia.Apart from trade, the second pillar of Gothenburg has traditionally been manufacturing and industry, which significantly contributes to the city's wealth. Major companies operating plants in the area include SKF, Volvo (both cars and trucks), and Ericsson. Volvo Cars is the largest employer in Gothenburg, not including jobs in supply companies. The blue-collar industries which have dominated the city for long are still important factors in the city's economy, but they are being gradually replaced by high-tech industries.Banking and finance are also important, as well as the event and tourist industry.Gothenburg is the terminus of the Valdemar-G\u00f6teborg gas pipeline, which brings natural gas from the North Sea fields to Sweden, through Denmark.Historically, Gothenburg was home base from the 18th century of the Swedish East India Company. From its founding until the late 1970s, the city was a world leader in shipbuilding, with such shipyards as Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, G\u00f6taverken, Arendalsvarvet, and Lindholmens varv. Gothenburg is classified as a global city by GaWC, with a ranking of Gamma\u2212. The city has been ranked as the 12th-most inventive city in the world by Forbes.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nGothenburg became a city municipality with an elected city council when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. The municipality has an assembly consisting of 81 members, elected every fourth year. Political decisions depend on citizens considering them legitimate. Political legitimacy can be based on various factors: legality, due process, and equality before the law, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy. One method used to achieve greater legitimacy for controversial policy reforms such as congestion charges is to allow citizens to decide or advise on the issue in public referendums. In December 2010 a petition for a local referendum on the congestion tax, signed by 28,000 citizens, was submitted to the City Council. This right to submit so-called \u201cpeople's initiatives\u201d was inscribed in the Local Government Act, which obliged local governments to hold a local referendum if petitioned by 5% of the citizens unless the issue was deemed to be outside their area of jurisdiction or if a majority in the City Council voted against holding such a referendum. A second petition for a referendum, signed by 57,000 citizens, was submitted to the local government in February 2013. This petition followed a campaign organised by a local newspaper \u2013 G\u00f6teborgs Tidningen \u2013 whose editor-in-chief argued that the paper's involvement was justified by the large public response to a series of articles on the congestion tax, as well as out of concern for the local democracy.\n\n\n== Proportion of foreign born ==\nIn 2019, approximately 28% (159,342 residents) of the population of Gothenburg were foreign born and approximately 46% (265,019 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. In addition, approximately 12% (69,263 residents) were foreign citizens.In 2016, 45% of Gothenburg's immigrant population is from other parts of Europe, and 10% of the total population is from another Nordic country.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGothenburg has two universities, both of which started as colleges founded by private donations in the 19th century. The University of Gothenburg has about 38,000 students and is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia, and one of the most versatile in Sweden. Chalmers University of Technology is a well-known university located in Johanneberg 2 km (1 mi) south of the inner city, lately also established at Lindholmen in Norra \u00c4lvstranden, Hisingen.In 2015, there were ten adult education centres in Gothenburg: Agnesbergs folkh\u00f6gskola, Arbetarr\u00f6relsens folkh\u00f6gskola i G\u00f6teborg, Finska folkh\u00f6gskolan, Folkh\u00f6gskolan i Angered, G\u00f6teborgs folkh\u00f6gskola, Kvinnofolkh\u00f6gskolan, Mo G\u00e5rd folkh\u00f6gskola, S:ta Birgittas folkh\u00f6gskola, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6talands folkh\u00f6gskolor and Wendelsbergs folkh\u00f6gskola.In 2015, there were 49 high schools Gothenburg. Some of the more notable schools are Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet, G\u00f6teborgs H\u00f6gre Samskola, Sigrid Rudebecks gymnasium and Polhemsgymnasiet. Some high-schools are also connected to large Swedish corporations, such as SKF Technical high-school that is owned by SKF and Gothenburg's technical high-school that is jointly owned by Volvo, Volvo Cars and Gothenburg municipality.There are two folkh\u00f6gskola that teach fine arts: Domen and Goteborg Folkh\u00f6gskola.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nWith over 90 km (56 mi) of double track, the Gothenburg tram network covers most of the city and is the largest tram/light rail network in Scandinavia. Gothenburg also has a bus network. Boat and ferry services connect the Gothenburg archipelago to the mainland. The lack of a subway is due to the soft ground on which Gothenburg is situated. Tunneling is very expensive in such conditions.\nThe Gothenburg commuter rail with three lines services some nearby cities and towns.\n\n\n=== Rail and intercity bus ===\nOther major transportation hubs are Centralstationen (Gothenburg Central Station) and the Nils Ericson Terminal with trains and buses to various destinations in Sweden, as well as connections to Oslo and Copenhagen (via Malm\u00f6).\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nGothenburg is served by G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport (IATA: GOT, ICAO: ESGG), located about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city centre. It is named after nearby locality Landvetter. Flygbussarna offer frequent bus connections to and from Gothenburg with travel time 20\u201330 minutes. Swebus, Flixbus and Nettbuss also serve the airport with several daily departures to Gothenburg, Bor\u00e5s and other destinations along European route E4. V\u00e4sttrafik, the local public transport provider in the area, offers additional connections to Landvetter.The airport is operated by Swedish national airport operator Swedavia, and with 6.8 million passengers served in 2017, it is Sweden's second-largest airport after Stockholm Arlanda. It serves as a base for several domestic and international airlines, e.g. Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. G\u00f6teborg Landvetter, however, does not serve as a hub for any airline. In total, there are about 50 destinations with scheduled direct flights to and from Gothenburg, most of them European. An additional 40 destinations are served via charter.The second airport in the area, G\u00f6teborg City Airport (IATA: GSE, ICAO: ESGP), is closed. On 13 January 2015, Swedish airport operator Swedavia announced that G\u00f6teborg City Airport will not reopen for commercial services following an extensive rebuild of the airport started in November 2014, citing that the cost of making the airport viable for commercial operations again was too high, at 250 million kronor ($31 million). Commercial operations will be gradually wound down. The airport was located 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city centre. It was formerly known as S\u00e4ve Flygplats. It is located within the borders of Gothenburg Municipality. In addition to commercial airlines, the airport was also operated by a number of rescue services, including the Swedish Coast Guard, and was used for other general aviation. Most civil air traffic to G\u00f6teborg City Airport was via low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. Those companies have now been relocated to Landvetter Airport.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Swedish company Stena Line operates between Gothenburg/Frederikshavn in Denmark and Gothenburg/Kiel in Germany.The \"England ferry\" (Englandsf\u00e4rjan) to Newcastle via Kristiansand (run by the Danish company DFDS Seaways) ceased at the end of October 2006, after being a Gothenburg institution since the 19th century. DFDS Seaways' sister company, DFDS Tor Line, continues to run scheduled cargo ships between Gothenburg and several English ports, and these used to have limited capacity for passengers and their private vehicles. Also freight ships to North America and East Asia leave from the port.\n\n\n=== Freight ===\nGothenburg is an intermodal logistics hub and Gothenburg harbour has access to Sweden and Norway via rail and trucks. Gothenburg harbour is the largest port in Scandinavia with a cargo turnover of 36.9 million tonnes per year in 2004.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nTwo of the noted people from Gothenburg are fictional, but have become synonymous with \"people from Gothenburg\". They are a working class couple called Kal and Ada, featured in \"Gothenburg jokes\" (g\u00f6teborgsvitsar), songs, plays and names of events. Each year two persons who have significantly contributed to culture in the city are given the honorary titles of \"Kal and Ada\". A bronze statue of the couple made by Svenrobert Lundquist, was placed outside the entrance to Liseberg in 1995.Some of the noted people from Gothenburg are Academy Award Winning actress Alicia Vikander, cookbook author Sofia von Porat, footballer Gunnar Gren, artist Evert Taube, golfer Helen Alfredsson, industrialist Victor Hasselblad, singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, diplomat Jan Eliasson, British Open Winner and professional golfer Henrik Stenson, YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), the most subscribed-to individual on the platform, with over 100 million subscribers  and YouTuber RoomieOfficial (Joel Berghult).\n\n\n== International rankings ==\nGothenburg has performed well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:\nThe Global Destination Sustainability Index has named Gothenburg the world's most sustainable destination every year since 2016.In 2019 Gothenburg was selected by the EU as one of the top 2020 European Capitals of Smart Tourism.In 2020 Business Region G\u00f6teborg received the 'European Entrepreneurial Region Award 2020' (EER Award 2020) from the EU.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Gothenburg Award is the city's international prize that recognises and supports work to achieve sustainable development \u2013 in the Gothenburg region and from a global perspective. The award, which is one million Swedish crowns, is administrated and funded by a coalition of the City of Gothenburg and 12 companies.  Past winners of the award have included Kofi Annan, Al Gore, and Michael Biddle.\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nGothenburg is twinned with:\n\nWith Lyon (France) there is no formal partnership, but \"a joint willingness to cooperate\".\nGothenburg had signed an agreement with Shanghai in 1986 which was upgraded in 2003 to include exchanges in culture, economics, trade and sport. The agreement was allowed to lapse in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGothenburg archipelago\nGothenburg Protocol (on acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone)\nGothenburg quadricentennial jubilee\nLargest cities of the European Union by population within city limits\nList of metropolitan areas in Europe\nMetropolitan Gothenburg\nG\u00f6teborgs rap\u00e9\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoteborg.se \u2013 Official site for city of Gothenburg (in Swedish)\nGoteborg.se/english \u2013 Official web page for short English description of the content in city of Gothenburg site\nInternational.Goteborg.se \u2013 Official international site for city of Gothenburg\n G\u00f6teborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGoteborg.com \u2013 Gothenburg tourism portal\nVisitSweden \u2013 VisitSweden's profile of Gothenburg\nVirtual Tour Panoramas of Goteborg",

          "For just a busticket you can go by boat and visit The beautiful Islands in The Gothenburg archipelago.",
          "The Gothenburg archipelago is amazing, but if you add 20 minutes to your trip- you get to visit the even more genuine northern archipelago. Both are really nice but I personally prefer Marstrand or something else",
          "The southern archipelago of Gothenburg is easy accessible and close to the city. I think its best experienced from a sea kayak on a guided tour or tip. Lots of wildlife!",
          "The fun starts with the 11 tram to Saltholmem, in itself a pleasure moving from suburbia to delightful Gothenberg western outskirt. The tram arrives pretty much as the ferry boat departs on its circular route from island to island on which there are small beaches, lovely walks",
          "Taking a boat out to visit the archipelago is a must when in Gothenburg for a few days. On sunny days it's truly beautiful. Just like any other archipelago it might get really windy and rainy on other days. However, well dressed for the occasion I feel that these days provide a",
          "The Gothenburg Archipelago is truly amazing. Few sandy beaches but instead you have the smooth polished rock slabs that stretch out into the water and give you whole different perspective on beach-life. The picturesque little towns and villages that still work and live as",
          "I really liked the time I spent out here. Could easily be a day trip depending on your interests in walking around in nature. Pay attention to the slow vs fast ferries if you are on a time crunch.",
          "A perfect place to visit a sunny summerday. Yu are able to reach the island with the ferry from saltholmen. Ive written some about it on http://world-info.se/europe/northern-europe/scandinavia/sweden/gothenburg/some-summer-pics-from-our-beautiful-archipelago-in-gothenburg/",
          "I live in Gothenburg and one of the things I love most is to go around by boat in the archepelago. Very easy to take a tram from the center of Gothenburg to l\u00e5ngedrag , where the boats go from. You can travel on the tram and then the boat with the same ticket. Cost very little",
          "I suppose my views would be taken for subjective since the archipelago is just outside my own hometown, but this is very much a breathing hole for myself and my family no matter what time of the year. However, I guess people from outside would appreciate the archipelago more",
          "All near each other....great for sunbathing and its just gorgeous. Langedrag has 1 nice restaurant. Again show up in summer time....ride the ferries to the outer islands and go swimming.",
          "The atmosphere, the buildings, the water and the swimming areas! Yes, everything is perfect! The only downside can be the weather.",
          "In comparison to Gothenburg it was absolutely useless and boring trip, may be due to the timing (end of November) it is wAy better to stay in Gothenburg as you can always find there hips of different things to see and do!!!",
          "If you want to see how people managed to live on every piece of land - go and see this small islands! On some there are only 2-3 houses! But the gardens are arranged, the houses are in good shape! The people we met are very friendly and English is spoken by everyone! You may",
          "I visited on a cold, but dry day in November. The scenery was lovely and the people friendly on all the islands I visited. However there is not much to see/do during the winter. I found all the public toilets were shut, museum shut and cafes had limited opening hours. Also",
          "It's a very nice place, specially during summer. I went there with my girlfriend and the views with the complete environment there definitely were worth the visit.",
          "Take the ferry to Br\u00e4nn\u00f6. Follow the way a few hundred meters. Just before the shop there is a sign \"Galter\u00f6v\u00e4gen\", on your right hand. From there you can do a lovely wandering to and on Galter\u00f6. Wonderful place!",
          "we were based in Gothenburg - in the Odin - an excellent Hotel which I have reviewed separately. You can travel to Saltholmen ferry port by tram - a pleasant tram ride takes about 45 mins. Catch the ferry which tours and stops at most of the islands from there. It is part of the",
          "Branno I can recommend very highly. Quaint, pretty houses right on the path, mostly foot and bicycle traffic, a great get away. Styrso and Donso not so much. The motorcycles and motorized bikes moved very fast along the narrow paths. We did not feel safe at all.",
          "Salt in the air, special plants that only grown here, some nature preserves, small communitites on the islands. And you get to take the ferry there with your bus card. So nice! In the summer plenty of places to swim and sunbathe. On a beach with others or on a cliff somewhere",
          "If you want a break from the city a visit to any of the islands in the south is recommended. Personally Br\u00e4nn\u00f6 and Vr\u00e5ng\u00f6 is my favorites. Br\u00e4nn\u00f6 maybe most as it is so close to reach by boat, and it has all you can ask for for being a small island.",
          "Was lucky enough to enjoy the islands on a sunny day. I spent a few hours walking around and it was awesome. Recommend taking some food and having a picnic if the weather is good, because there are lots of tables and good spots to do this.",
          "Extremely sad and desolated. We have been in Styrso days ago and still trying to figure out why is so popular.",
          "If you pick a sunny day in Goteborg you cannot miss a trip in the south archipelago! The connections are very good: take the tram number 11 to Satholmen and then the first boat that sails to the islands. You can use the same ticket of the tram to get on the boat (it costs 2.50\u20ac",
          "We visited g\u00f6teborg for a couple of days and a visit to the southern archipelago really worth it. You can easily get there by using public transport (tram number 11) and then boat, by using the same transport card. The islands are unique, a place to relax by following any of the",
          "It is quite nice but like the northern part better. One can take one of the boats out on a cruise from Lilla Bommen in Gothenburg if one wants to have a quick tour.",
          "When I read reviews of this, I wasn't quite sure what this was about. In a nutshell, this is an experience of island hopping. The locals use these ferries to travel to and fro from the islands where they live to Gothenburg city. The attractions here are: beaches, wildlife and a",
          "When I recently was working in Gothenburg I was overwhelmed by its beauty and the people. But the idea that you could buy a public transit ticket and catch a trolley from downtown to the ferry station and then pick up a boat to visit the islands was unexpected and breathtaking.",
          "I took a quick excursion trip out to the Archipelago to see some of the islands. We were gone for just a few hours but was a good way to see the islands and to get some of the history of the landmarks as we were traveling out to the islands and also past the islands.",
          "I went on a Friday. This is a nice and relaxing day out, catching the ferries over the Archipelago and just walking around. However, there is not much here. A few small towns, a few nice beaches, short nature walks etc."

        "wiki": "Eriksberg is an area on Hisingen in Gothenburg where Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstads AB had their shipyard until bankruptcy in 1979. For over a century the area was dominated by shipbuilding but a crisis in the 1970s destroyed the industry.\nSince the collapse of the shipyards, the area has been rebuilt into a modern neighbourhood. The former machinery buildings have been renovated into a hotel with conference facilities. An 84-metre high gantry crane \u2013 the Eriksberg crane \u2013 stands as a remnant of the area's shipbuilding past.\nA large grass area, now used for apartment buildings, was used for concerts from 1986 to 1990 (when Ullevi was closed for such concerts). Michael Jackson performed in front of 106,000 people for 2 sold-out shows during his Bad World Tour in June 1988. U2 performed in 1987, and the Rolling Stones and Madonna in 1990.\nIn 2014, the progressive metal band Evergrey from Gothenburg filmed a music video for the song \"King Of Errors\" from their album Hymns for the Broken atop the Eriksberg gantry crane.\n\n\n== References ==",

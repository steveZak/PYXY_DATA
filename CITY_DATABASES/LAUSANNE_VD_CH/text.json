          "My husband and I toured the museum right before the Olympics started and enjoyed the retrospective tour of the Olympics through the years. If you like history or sports or a good view of Lake Geneva while eating lunch or having a coffee, you should definitely spend some time",
          "After having had a most excellent Brunch at the Tom Cafe on the top floor of the museum we made our visit through the museum which had a special feature on South Korea and the next Winter Olympic games. This especially organized part on the Winter Olympic games of 2018 carried",

          "When the sponsoring organization opens a museum you won't get the full picture. This museum conveniently touts all the \"great\" development that happens before the Olympics and ignores the legacy of increasingly costly Olympics that result in buildings that end up as ruins,",
          "If you are a sports fan and are interested in the history of the Olympic Games, then go and visit this fine Museum. You will learn a lot about the history, athletes, locations, opening ceremonies, etc. on an interactive Parcours. It is something for all ages and needs about 2.5",

          "Right from the start, the museum is in a beautiful setting: from the lakefront (Lake Geneva) you climb stairs through a series of terraces dotted with various exhibits, including the resting place of the Olympic torch between games. The museum itself is thoughtfully organized:",

          "Interesting museum for adults. For kids is not worth it. The fees are exaggerated versus the value provided. Very poor !",
          "The view alone is very impressive overlooking Lake Geneva. The entrance to museum is laden with sculptures relevant to the Olympic movement. Inside is nicely laid with various aspects of the Olympics laid out in a clear notntoo busy format.",

          "We were fortunate enough to tour this museum today. The entrance draws you in with its art, and historical pictures, and walking into the building past the columns (like an Olympic ceremony with torches!). Inside there is a beautiful lamp hanging from the Olympic Rings, at the",
          "Found this museum to be a most interesting as well as hands on experience. Not only did it define the various sports that have come and gone in the Olympics, thru the years, but showed the evolution of the various uniforms or costumes worn by the various athletes, but also a",
          "Starts with history, then takes you through the various games and also shows many articles of clothing and equipment from the games. I recommend all visitors read 'The Lords of the Rings' by Andrew Jennings. It will change your perspective and open your mind about this tight",

          "Desultory. This museum has the obvious - history of the Games, sites of the Games, reproduction medals. But there is nothing here to excite the spirit. It is a museum conceived by a Swiss functionary with little imagination, rather than by an enthusiast. I would have liked to",
          "Great museum for family. Went with my husband and daughter who was 4 at the time. It was free when we went. Located by the beautiful lake lemon. For people who is interested in Olympic history and also enjoy a lakeside stroll is the idea place to go when you visit Lausanne.",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation.

          "The view at the tower is lovely - over the city and surrounding area, as well as the lake and snow covered mountains. The construction details are also interesting. I found it a challenging climb, but I succeeded. If taking public transportation, make sure to take the right",
          "This was a great surprise as it is one of the few free things to do!! the view from the top of the tower is wonderful, it's also really unique tour with a two-way staircase. you catch the number 16 bus up and it takes you down a different route , so you get to see a whole",
          "This tower located in the top of Lausanne, seems to come out of a movie of \"star wars\"..... The view once you reach the top is breathtaking...",
          "This place was 10 min drive away from where we were staying so we decided to visit. It was the first place we visited in the day and it's built in a cute little wooded park. It's a tall tower built entirely in wood - not ticketed but only about 50 odd people can go at a time. It",
          "It was a little hard to find via car since I was expecting to see a huge structure visible from the road. Just look for the signs to the lac Sauvabelin and you should be ok. The parking area is close to a caf\u00e9/ restaurant and a park and small pond. It\u2019s a short walk to see the",
          "It\u2019s a bit outside of town but a short Uber or bus ride gets you there easily...or you could walk if you\u2019re pretty fit. It\u2019s free of charge and offers an amazing view of the city, lake and mountains.",
          "If you're looking for a place to unwind and walk in an almost natural setting, the Parc de Sauvabelin is a great place. Not too many people, quiet and fresh air. In the park is the tower which will give you a little extra exercise and allows a nice view on the surrounding areas.",
          "Very pleasant destination on a sunny day, certainly with kids. There are many animals such as cows, pigs, birds... a fantastic wooden playground for both small and larger kids, a wood and the tower. The tower is ok to climb for kids 4 zears and older. Views are impressive and I",
          "Tower is not too far from Cathedral, but be prepared for a walk up the whole time. Tower is located in nice area of Sauvabelin park. To get to the top you will climb 151 steps but the view is worth the effort.",
          "Great spot to stop in and get a perspective of the city and surrounding area that you cant get anywhere else. The kids love running up and down the stairs so that will tire them out while you are at it. Very interesting to see the mountains across the lake; the towers,",
          "Sauvabelin Tower is a construction of wood, located in the Sauvabelin Park, a upper zone in the surroundings of Lausanne, where people from the city go to relax, walk or run with animals and children. In fact, if you are lucky and the weather is good, you can go up by walk to",
          "I went just before sunset so caught beautiful views.. but please be aware there are lots to steps to climb. Also while climbing down, there was no light so it is dangerous and risky esp if you have kids with you.",
          "It took around 10-15 mins to climb up the spiral stairs. Once up, a nice view of Lausanne and Lake Geneva was there as a reward for the little exercise. Definitely a must if you're around the park.",
          "Climbed up this tower during a leisurely wander through the forest. It\u2019s a bit of a climb to the top but worth doing for the brilliant views of Lake Geneva and the rest of the forest. It\u2019s also free as well, so no money required.",
          "A would tower in the florest, huge, they have some maps, it moves a little when the wind it's a little but strong, you can see Geneva to Villeneuve, if you want to spend a different day walking in the woods there's a good option.",
          "With a short bus ride from the town of Lausanne, you can travel to the beautiful park that has the Sauvabelin Tower! There is a nice cafe in the park with a playground for the children. It is along a small lake, with ducks, and trails. From the main trail, you can discover",

          "This tower is a strange construction in the parc de Sauvabelin and offers nice views over Lausanne and the lac L\u00e9man. Not for you if you are afraid of heights ...",
          "This is well worth visiting for the fantastic views across the lake. It is not too difficult to climb, even the four year old was fine. It is free to access. It is worth noting that TA has it in the wrong location on its map, it is actually out of the city centre.",
          "I highly recommend running around in the forrest of Sauvabelin, run up to the tower, enjoy the view and if you have enough, take a Movenpick ice cream in a nearby restaurant. We live nearby and this is one of our favourite places.",
          "You need a head for heights and to be able to cope with lots of spiral stairs! The tower is in a nice little park a short bus ride out of the main city centre. There was a pond and a mini 'farm'. My Mum decided not to come up the tower, so waited by the pond. You can see quite a",
          "The tower is a bit of a walk from the bus station, but as a whole the park and tower are worth it. Experience the climb up these massive steps, and at the top take a break as you look out from a magnificent view of Lausanne and Lac Leman. If you have time in Lausanne, I would",

          "Taking 250 stairs was really worth it when I reached the top! It's free of charge, open from 6am-9pm so go any time that suits you. Sunset, sunrise, noon The number of people is limited to 50 people at a time so visit at a time when it's not too crowded. Bring water and",
          "I took some initiative to visit this place bit away (thoug connected by city transports). But its Worth visiting. The view from the top is simply awesome (though its difficullt due to cold strong winds). You could also^take a stroll along the small pond nearby. A childrens' play",
          "Congrats to the architects and all the people who made this tower happen! What I love about it is that an amazing panoramic view upon Lausanne, together with the Alps (if the weather permits it) is available to everyone for free! The surroundings make it seem like you're going",
          "A curious wooden tower in the middle of a forest on a hill over Lausanne. Don't be lazy and climb up, a stunning view of Lausanne and the nearby small lake will please your eyes. Take a small boat trip or a coffe on the lakeside (this is NOT Geneva lake)",
          "Living in Lausanne, I like to bring visitors to the Parc de Souvabelin with its quaint little lake, and then invite them to climb the tower. The view is definitely worth it.",
          "Being there at Sauvabelin is nice, because you are in the forest, around a very little lake, but do not come there for this view only, remain in the vignobles du Lavaux, quite more beautiful.",
          "After climbing all the 302 steps of the tower, the reward will be worth the effort. On a sunny day it is possible to see the lake and the cities of Evian and Thonon in France with the Mont Blanc in the background.",
          "Combine fitness with site seeing and trek up to the top of this huge tower. When we were there a couple of guys were jogging up and down! The trek is well worth it with great views from the top. You can see Mont Blanc on a clear day as well as out over the lake. As a free way to",

          "Besides the view over Lausanne and Lake Geneva, being at the top of the tower also allows identifying some of the prominent peaks from the Alps on the French side. I only wish the warning/instruction signs would also be in English rather than just French. It would be a",
          "The weather was clear the day I went there. I took the bus there, otherwise there's a small climb to it. The double spiral staircase (one way up, one way down) is a bit tiring, but the views over Lausanne were very good and different from those I got from the Cath\u00e9drale de",
          "In the forest, a pebble's throw from the small artificial lake at Sauvabelin, the 35-m tower with a staircase in the shape of Archimedes screw (two spirals, one up, one down) is built of local wood. From the top you get a great 360\u00b0 view over Lausanne and Lake Geneva. Bus 16",
          "The Sauvabelin Tower just happened to be only 10 minutes walk from our residence in Lausanne. It has a really interesting construction - wooden beams twist around a center point to create 2 staircases - supposedly one to up and the other to come down. The view from the top is",
          "A great timber structure with an awesome viewing platform. Great panoramic views of Lausanne, the mountains and the lake! It was easy to get there using public transport. We then walked back to town as part of the 'A Panoramic stroll'. It was definitely the best view of the",
          "To get here you need the number 16 bus up to Lac de Sauvabelin and then its just a 5 minute walk. The whole structure is wooden and you need a head for heights to climb the double helix stairs to the viewing platform. Views are wirth it on a clear day.",
          "Apparently it was under construction way before us. Not sure why it is taking so long. But we heard from the locals that it gives an amazing view of beautiful Lausanne. We were not lucky to see that.",
          "Very interesting arwork that is also a tower you can climb so it is also functional located in Lausanne Switzerland. Wear comfortable shoes",
          "...until the end of June. It's quite a hike from the city (all uphill), unless you take the bus, but it does seem like there would be a lovely view from the top when it reopens. There's a playground and Movenpick cafe close by if you're traveling with kids.",
          "The tower is strangely a must do for me but I like to climb tall things. The view is brilliant from the top! Interesting construction and free entry make it a worth while viait. It is set in a nice patch of forest. If you have kids be sure to visit the small farm nearby to see",
          "The tower is situated in a woodland in the north of Lausanne. We caught the metro up to sallaz and walked to the tower from there. There is lovely walk through the woods to get to the tower. Unfortunately it was closed for work when we visited, which was very disappointing but",
          "If you have a car, don't miss this spot. It's free, it's eco-friendly built and it offers an unique sight!",
          "I climb the tower during my jogging. It's a marvellous reward. The panorama is outstanding. And the woods around are ver beautiful.",
          "Nice walk around to Sauvabelin Lake, followed by a stroll around the forest. Climbing the Sauvabelin Tower and ending at the Chalet Swiss. Perfect plan for a Sunday. With kids, dogs, grand parents, visitors...Good all year around. The nature in the area is beautiful.if you don't",
          "I finally got the opportunity to climb to the top of the tower. Over the past year every time I went to visit the tower it was closed for some reason... too late... under repair... inclement weather... Today, though, I made it to the top of the tower I've admired from below.",
          "The park arround Lac Sauvabelin is very beautiful, but in icy or snowing days, the tower is closed because of risk of falls. Anyay, is a good sightseeing for a very cold day in Lausanne.",
          "Very good view and surroundings, worth a visit is spending time in Lausanne. Also the walk around the little lake is worth.",
          "It is a great place to go to spend a couple of hours with little ones. There is a restaurant nearby and a park with swings and slides and animals nearby as well. The tower is a beautiful structure and reminds you of something you might have constructed out of match sticks.",
          "Nice tower in the middle of the wood of the Sauvabelin forest. It is a quite easy climb up and from there you will have a very nice view 360 degrees around. Lots of playground around for kids to have some great outdoor fun.",
          "Loads of stairs to climb but worth doing to enjoy the view of Lausanne and suburbs. The Sauvabelin park is a nice place to go to enjoy the forest. Relaxing and fun for everyone",
          "Enjoy the romantic sunset from Sauvabelin tower. There is a spectacular view all over Lausanne, Alps and Geneva lake. The surroundings are great for a Sunday walk or if you fancy an intense run.",
          "I really loved this place, we walked a lot and we went wrong way! After half an hour we found out it was just near the bus stop And really worth to go there, spectacular scenery!",
          "From the top of this tower you will have a fantastic view of Lausanne and the Lake (Lac Lehman - also known as Lake Geneva). It has a bi-directional spiral staircase that would not be suitable for really young children. From the look-out deck at the top you have 360 degree",
          "from this tower you will have a beautiful view of Lausanne and arounds. You will have a lot of stairs to climb but the final result is really cool.",
          "you climb up this wooden tower on a very interesting staircase. It is free and you can enjoy beautiful views of the lake, lausanne and the surroundings. Make sure weather is nice though...",
          "The Sauvabelin Tower is undergoing repairs from April to July 29, 2016. The lake is also empty, undergoing some reconstruction activity. The large wooded park is still a pleasant outing, easy to get to, take the #16 bus from Ste Francois stop above the train station.",
          "not hard to do and to go and see... Have a try.... it is free and make exercises ! it offers a 360\u00b0 view on Lausanne and its surrounding. It is next to a nice park and lake where oyu can also have a typical swiss lunch or dinner.",
          "Not to be missed if you dare to walk all the way up to the observation deck. Yes! No elevator. But it will be worth your while. The tower itself is located in the middle of a wood in the north of Lausanne. The bus number 16 will take you there and you will need to walk about 5",
          "Was there yesterday, and the tower is still closed. Repairs were ongoing. Shame, can imagine the views would be great from the top so will go back another time. Even so, it's a pretty impressive structure to come across in the middle of the forest.",
          "the tower is open again after being closed for repairs for much of 2015 ... on a nice day the 360 degree panoramic views are excellent",
          "A must visit in the region. The Tower provides a full view over Lausanne, and is located in the middle of the nature. You could from there makes some trek nearby.",
          "We decided to have a nice walk throw the forest, and we checked if any attraction where around, it comes up with this tower, we checked on line prises and timetable, (in this case free).. Amazing!!! But unfortunately was close because of refurbishment, it's absolutely crazy to",
          "In the middle of a nice countryside park area. Can have a nice stroll in the park even if you don't go up this - however, very nice views of Lausanne / lake Geneva from the top. Free to enter, but it's quite a lot of steps. Best public transport route is via the Metro to the",
          "The place is calm and relaxing with a pond and swiss cafe, restaurants around it. Also has a tower with the view of Lausanne. Nothing too special, but good place to spend a lazy summer afternoon.",
          "The tower itself is nice, but the location and surroundings make it worth the walk. It is quite a climb, so be prepared",
          "This place is interesting in any time of the year, but most in autumn, I believe. All trees are coloured in different colours which adds brightness to the scenery. To enjoy the view you will need to climb up the stairs (interesting tower design). No elevator available. The",
          "This construction is amazing! Its stairs are shaped into a double helix inspired by the DNA structure! The view from the top is stunning! In a clear day you can see Mt Blanc and all the French alps plus Alpes Vaudoises and part of Valais. I recommend it although the hike to the",
          "Just above the \"city\" (town?) of Lausanne, is this wooden tower to be climbed and check out the view of the Mountains and Laussane. But the surrounding area is also very beautiful!",
          "In the morning, catch bus 16 to Sauvabelin. Walk 300m through the forest to reach the wood tower; just push the turnstile (entrance is free) and climb the spiral stair up to the top to watch the city and its surrounding. A good walk down to the lake takes around 2-4hours through",
          "The view from tower was nice. We could see the alpen mountain, Lausanne lake dan the city. Unfortunately, it was snowing, foggy and cloudy so it's not clear enough to see the whole scenery. There was no buses back to the city, I had to walk down the hill for 15 minutes to get",
          "Nice walk through the park and then the steep climb to the top of the tower. This is a nice activity to do with the family or even in the context of a business visit with foreigners. The view of Lausanne and all around is just breath-taking, especially in clear days.",
          "Visited here recently with my family for xmas and the view you get from the top ON A CLEAR day is really exceptional. If you know you're geography of the area you can easily spot Geneva , the high valais mountains and numerous other local tourist sites. Kids small animal park",
          "I really wanted to go up there and enjoy the view of lake Geneva but unfortunately when i went there it was closed for maintenance. But i enjoyed walking around there anyway",
          "Take the 16 bus from Lausanne Bel-Air or St-Fran\u00e7ois to reach the park. The tower is indicated next to the small lake. If you have no fear of high tower you have to try it!",
          "Beautiful view of Lake Geneva & surrounding mountains. Break away from the busy city centre & climb to the top of this wood structure, free access!",
          "This is a tower located little outside of the city inside a nature park. The tower architecture is interesting and on a clear day one could see whole lausanne and even geneva from the tower.",
          "From the top of the tower there is an amazing view of the lake and Alps as well as Lausanne and the surrounding area. I came in Autumn so we got there after a nice walk through the orange woods. It's right by the Sauvabelin lake and petting zoo which is great from kids, and",
          "This tower is a nice place to visit and especially for teenagers it's great to walk up the stairs and have a great view. Close by there is a nice forest to walk.",
          "Nice for a little visit, there is a zoo and park around, nice views, but thats it. Nothing too exciting.",
          "Lovely park with a strange tower in the middle - great to climb up - be aware it gets windy near the top and its quite open, so I wouldnt let very small children climb",
          "The wooden construction of the tower is unique for me. The platform is over the top of the trees. So if it is good weather then you have beautiful view. You can even see Mount Blanc!",
          "We took the bus to a nearby bus stop and still had quite a nice walk through the woods to the tower. However, we were a bit disappointed that we could not climb to the top of the tower as we had seen advertised in tour brochures. It would have been a great experience, but even",
          "Easy to access by bus and a walk, good if you want to follow a trail down into the city. I had a big walk that day. It is a pretty basic wooden structure that gives you a great view over the city. Well worth a visit and a bush walk",
          "I visited this attraction with friends on 02 October 2025; to be met with a sign to say it was closed for repairs until 30th sept - very very disappointing!",
          "The tower is bulit by wood, and we can see all of beautiful Lausanne and get excellent 360 view. We have to pass the forest if we go from Sallaz.",
          "The tower is located inside Sauvavelin park. It's a good sized park to go for a walk and combining it with an authentic cheese fondue at Chalet Suisse that is basically 10 minutes walk from the tower. Easy to reach by car and easy to park.",
          "A great construction work and worth it to see, but not possible to climb up at the moment. Anyway a nice walk back to town within just 15 min. Going up is possible by bus no. 16",
          "This tower is entirely made of wood and is not easy to find if you are not from the area. The numerous stairs can be challenging, but the view above is fantastic, a 360 degree view of the Alps, Lake Geneva, the Jura mountains and the Vaud countryside.",
          "Worth a visit.. you can see quite far.. uphill walk though and in the forest.................................. ......",
          "Marvelous!! The view is hard to beat, and the architecture is unique. The boat ride in the pond looked lame, so we skipped it.",
          "Not the easiest place to reach by car however worth a visit. The top of the tower is even higher than the eiffel tower if you calculate the total hight of the place above sea level. With good visibility, you can see Lausanne city, the Lake, the Mont Blanc and great",
          "Unfortunately, we tried to navigate to this tower from the TripAdvisor listing. The address is wrong! It's currently listed as Avenue de Rhodanie 2, Lausanne 1000. This puts the tower right near the waterfront very close to the port area and the Olympic Museum. It's nowhere",
          "on the top of a hill, in a forest, it looks like a matches building, and is quite funny to climb up (2 different stairs to go up and to come down, turning in opposite directions). The view is nice, and in fact you can see the top otf the tower from a lot of spots around Lausanne.",
          "This is an excellent park to have a walk or run or do what ever you fell like ,then walk the stairs to see the beautiful view of the city of Lausanne",
          "Cute little area for walking, seeing farm animals, and a little restaurant that overlooks the pond. Climb the tower to see all of Lausanne. It's a great (and free!) way to spend a gorgeous sunny afternoon.",
          "A fantastic view over Lake Geneva and the whole of Lausanne, even if it is quite a climb to get to the top! My partner and I are quite young and fit, but it was extremely cold and I have to say, I struggled!! Would probably not be ideal for the very old or anyone with a physical",
          "Definitely worth to go. If you like hiking, don't take the bus up and enjoy your way ... there are some spots where you can take pictures and enjoy the view before you get there. If you are not in shape you can always take the bus. Close to the sight you have restaurant and a",
          "Great views of Lake Geneva from atop this tower and best of all, it's free! Too bad it is very un-Swisslike poorly maintained. I was looking at the plaques commemorating the people and organizations that funded the building of the tower, and thought that if I were one of them, I",
          "This is a wooden structure that requires a bit of effort to get to the top. Fine for most people but simply be warned if one of the people with you is not necessarily fit. Other than that it is nice to have a view of the lake and surrounding mountains etc. Splendid. Easily worth",
          "Great views. Highest point in Lausanne probably. Great for running up! Lovely location and not far from the children's zoo. Closes at dark. Never busy.",
          "Sauvabelin Tower is located in Sauvabelin forest and is easy accessible by bus 16. Take it from metro station Bessi\u00e8res and get off at Lac Sauvabelin. Takes about 15 minutes. You can stop at a restaurant or walk around the lake where you can see funny hairy pigs and other",
          "Not much more to say other than it's a great place to go with young children. I'ts accessible with pt, but also lots of parking. There are 2 playgrounds, a cafe & restaurant. THere's a lovely walk in the woods to reach the tower. Maybe not great for the younger ones as they",
          "it's quite a trek from the centre to get to the top of the tower and very steep in places, but not only do you get brilliant views, you also get an amazing building, so make sure you take your camera. If you're suffering from vertigo, don't go, it's all very secure with",
          "Getting here is easy, walking up is still pretty easy, but the view from the top was hard. Hard to LEAVE! Breathtaking on a clear day, I would definitely go up this tower for longer next time. Perhaps for half a day with the right food, water, clothing... hmm...",
          "Although I wouldn't really classify this as a must for tourists, it does make a nice activity for residents of the Lausanne area especially those with children. The tower itself is perhaps a 30 minute event. Walk up (there is no lift), enjoy the views, walk down. Perhaps of more",
          "Nice hike around the city. I quite enjoyed the hike up the steps and looking around the city. There are two photo maps on the observation deck that assist one in identifying what they are looking at. We were fortunate, it was a beautiful clear day and we could see for miles!",
          "This tower is nestled in a wood over lausanne, bit of a trek or get 16 bus to nearby car park. Get up on a clear day for great view of city and lake. It's a wooden structure that you can climb to the top of.",

          "a climb worthwile, gives you a beutiful view of the city, the lake and thenspectacular mountains on the french side. Well worth the walk and the climb, weather permitting",
          "I really love Lausanne exactly for places like this. If you are a tourist and feel pretty lost as to where to start visiting Lausanne I really reccomend the tower even before museums or restaurants. It was a little humid when we went so the creaky wood stairs were not very",
          "This is a unique tower, built completely from wood in 2003. It is located near Sauvabelin lake on the hill. The view from the tower is magnificent, however one need to reach the top first, which can be a challenge for itself.",
          "A visit to the tower is an excellent idea for walks in the park and forest, topped with a panoramic view of the entire lake and wonderful pictures! Combine it with a visit to the lake of Sauvabelin and a coffee or even fondue in the restaurants nearby.",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods.

It is composed of seven councilors (French: conseiller municipal/conseill\u00e8re municipale), each presiding over a directorate. One of the members act as mayor (syndic). In the mandate period 2016\u20132021 (la l\u00e9gislature) the Municipality is presided by Monsieur le Syndic Gr\u00e9goire Junod. Directoral tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Communal Council are carried by the Municipality. The regular election of the Municipality by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every five years. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipality. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud. The current mandate period is from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is later on elected as such by a public election as well by a system of Majorz, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Town Hall (L'H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de la Palud.As of 2016, Lausanne's Municipality is made up of three representatives of the PS (Social Democratic Party, of whom one is also the mayor), and two members of PES (Green Party), and one each of le Parti Ouvrier et Populaire Vaudois (POP) & gauche en mouvement (an alliance of the left parties POP (Parti Suisse du Travail \u2013 Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidarit\u00e9S and ind\u00e9pendant.e.s), and PLR (Les Lib\u00e9raux-Radicaux (PLR)), giving the left parties a very strong six out of seven seats. The last election was held on 28 February/20 March 2016. The mayor was elected by two ballots on 17 April/8 May 2016.\n\nSimon Affolter is Town Chancellor (chancelier municipal) since for the Municipality.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Communal Council (Conseil communal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 100 members, with elections held every five years. The Communal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipality and the administration. The sessions of the Communal Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipality, members of the Communal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Communal Council.

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods.

          "Inside, we paid to go up in the bell tower. Went up, looked at the large bells and then continued up to higher levels and more bells. I would definitely suggest that you walk up those old time-worn stone steps and have a look around.",
          "Beautiful spot to stop and find peace in the city. The Rose Window is so beautiful. There are quite a few stained glass windows telling various stories if you have time to stop and peruse them.",
          "The cathedral is quite amazing with a standout organ. Interesting history highlighting the reformation. Wonderful photography exhibit as well.",
          "For those who are fond of churches & cathedrals, from the architecture point of view and of course for a moment of meditation and prayer. This Cathedral is a great example and a must when in. Lausanne",
          "It\u2019s a nice cathedral but rather surprisingly small. I enjoyed browsing and the pretty stained glass windows. If in the area, as I was, stop in.",
          "The cathedral is very nice, but not that large. The stained glass windows are beautiful. We planned to return another day to climb the tower, but never had the opportunity.",
          "It's a quite nice visit, nevertheless, if you have been to a number of cathedrals in other cities you won't find this one worth visiting as it's not really stunning inside.",
          "And inside the church itself is quite small for how large the structure is. If you're in the city, you'll probably take a look, but it'll be quick. A bit of a view from the benches out front, but it's probably better from the top of the cathedral's tower (I did not climb it). It",
          "This is a nice cathedral with long history. But if you have been to a number of cathedrals in other cities, you may not have a strong feeling from it.",
          "It was an okay cathedral. I really went to climb the tower and get the views from the top. Well worth the climb. Even better when you can get the senioir rate!",
          "We took the challenging walk all the way from lakeside to the Cathedrale du Lausanne, and were quite impressed. A quick tour inside reveals the magnificent church organ, and then we climbed the 242 steps to the top of the tower, which reveals some wonderful views of Lausanne &",
          "We love visiting the great cathedrals, such as Rouen and Chartres, and so didn't expect all that much in Lausanne. But it was a lovely cathedral with a surprisingly interesting exhibit in the tower. The tower is absolutely worth climbing, for a spectacular view across the city",
          "Although it's a typical example of cathedrals of the time, the climb to the top of the tower was worth it for great views and especially watching the bell ringing (have ear-plugs - rolled-up tissues worked).",
          "This cathedral is without question the most impressive, beautiful and worshipful space in Lausanne, rising above the city in majestic splendor, Its very location makes it a bit of a challenge to get there, but the effort is rewarded. There is virtually no parking nearby.",
          "A haul up to the top part of Lausanne but use the excellent metro, then enjoy fabulous views from the cathedral, plus coffee and ice cream in one of the cafes just down a little.",
          "Walked from the train station (up hill) but worth it after seeing the views outside the cathedral. Visually lovely, calm place",
          "Looked very impressive from the Lausanne flon bridge but it is not that impressive from Inside. Actually there is so much houses around it is hard to get a good view. There is a nice sitting area of in front of the church that one point might have offered good view of the lake",
          "Great to visit in Lausanne. The views from the cathedral area are amazing and the cathedral is beautiful. The walks to get there are great! A must see in Lausanne",
          "After our tour of the Parc de Mon Repos, we hiked our way uphill to the cathedral; it is quite the workout the way we came as it was all uphill and we had to take a couple breathers before we made it to the top by the cathedral. The cathedral was dedicated in 1275 and is",
          "The cathedral is very beautiful, but it's a normal cathedral from 13th century. Compared to the French ones, it's not that remarkable...",
          "One of the iconic landmark of the ciy. If you are in Laussane even for a day or few hours, take a quick stroll to the cathedral, it involves a litlle uphilll climb but the good thing is that you go through the old city which is very refreshing with cobblestone road, market and",
          "Yesterday I had the pleasure of visiting the Lausanne Cathedral. This was a fabulous example of 12 Century Gothic architecture. From the amazing artistic and architectural details on the outside you walk through the doors to find even more of the same. Everywhere you looked was",
          "Love the Gothic architecture , the history and the fact that one can go all the way to the top of the cathedral and have this amazing view of Lake Geneva and the city below. You're in Lausanne....you have to visit and go up to the top....it's defintely worth the 5francs...just",
          "Easy to access via train, don't pay the extra amount for a tour from the city centre. Great view, slow water fountain. There's a co-op nearby so if you want to have a get some drinks or picnic this is a nice place",
          "This beautiful cathedral, located high above Lausanne, has great views of Lake Geneva and the portions of Lausanne that lie below. It dominates the area of Lausanne called Old Town. There are a number of stairs to climb to reach Old Town from New Town.",
          "This is a beautiful church that goes back to the 12th century and is quite didn't from many other churches I've visited. The Gothic facades, paints on the walls, the drawings on the rose stained windows are all distinctly different from other churches we've visited that belonged",
          "We visited the 12th century Gothic cathedral in the afternoon just in time for a group tour. The lovely lady generally conducts tours in French but she gladly took us in her group and with the consent of the other tourists, conducted the tour in English. Tours are about 45 min",
          "The Bell Tower has three different viewing platforms. The first level is reached by an easy to walk wooden staircase followed by a very wide stone spiral staircase. After walking around the wide platform look for a open door in one of the four corners; inside is a typical",
          "Nice church though at my age, I need to labor with the numerous steps. My teenage daughter has no problem with the stairs. Worthy of time and labor.",
          "At the Top of the Hill Of the Old Town Stands a Beautiful Cathedral. Majestic and an Amazing View Of Lausanne.",
          "This cathedral is literally the highest point in Lausanne. It is a beautiful spot without a doubt. We walked up a 500-year-old wooden staircase to get there and the views were amazing. You can climb to the top of the church spire if you want although we opted not to do that.",
          "We enjoyed the stained glass, the statues, the beautiful arches. A nice area to walk around and explore also.",
          "We spent a day in Lausanne and wandered into this cathedrale. There is really not much to see. And it is not in good repair. Much of the beauty that might have once been in this church was striped out during the reformation. Very stark.",
          "If walking to the cathedral, be prepared to climb. Hard to decide between climbing the steps or walking the steep incline at the final approach. We chose the steps. The stonework around the entrance and the stained glass windows inside impressed me most. There are also lovely",
          "Very impressive entrance with a lot of carving, beautiful stain glass windows, very high gothic arch, the cathedral is beautiful if you have time please go and visit.",
          "It was free to walk through this cathedral. It was very nice, with nice stained glass. We happened to be there when they played a little concert on the organ. Very cool sound.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful especially the rose shaped stain glass window. The paintings inside are also very remarkable.",
          "Very nice Gothic cathedral with an amazing view at the top of the tower. On the way up there was a level with the old choir stalls and a small exhibit. Most of the stairs were quite manageable; it got narrower and steeper almost at the top. The reward is a wonderful view of",
          "Nice piece of architect, walk by, and sightseeing. Placed in a nice location but not more than a couple of mins thing to see",
          "Top of the city. Directly on the metro line. Very easy to access. There was an organist playing the beautiful organ in the church. We climbed the bell tower. Well worth the climb to see the city, the lake and the mountains. Weather was perfect",
          "Wonderful 12th century gothic cathedral. Originally a Roman Catholic cathedral, but was taken over by protestants during the early 1500's. While in the cathedral you must see the rose window and the original entrance. Both provided biblical education to those early worshipers",
          "We had to climb I don't know how many stairs to reach the cathedral from the metro, but it was well worth it! A beautiful building with remarkable stained glass windows. I wish we could have been there for one of the organ recitals they have.",
          "Free entry to a lovely building. Beautiful stained glass windows and vaulted roof. An interesting display about their statues with text in English, French and German. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "When you are in Lausanne, visiting the cathedral is a great option. It is a gothic cathedral built in the 12th century. It is not as impressive as some French cathedrals, but definitely beautiful. An nice bonus point is the amazing view over the city of Lausanne and the Alps.",
          "As reformation came to Lausanne like many other churches with rich decorations also this church was stripped away from many of its decorations, but still in its simplicity the cathedral is beautiful inside and, if you have time for a quided tour, I am sure you get better insight",
          "A beautiful cathedral in the city center which is worth taking time to visit. The stained glass windows and organ are pretty amazing.",
          "beautiful but lacking some of the ornateness that you see from the grand old buildings. it will shine again as it looks like it is being renovated/restored/ good views from the top./",
          "We visited on Good Friday in time for the morning service. What a stunning building in the middle of Lausanne",

          "Inconspicuous from outside but splended inside. Rebuild in Lens limestone between 1892 and 1909 on the foundations of an original dating from the early 16th century. Tower of Belfry is open for a visit, you will get ther from shop and information part. In the middle of the",
          "wandered up to the cathedral on my first afternoon and enjoyed both walking around the outside and spending time inside - such a beautiful place full of history and yet so calm. worth a visit",
          "Lausanne\u2019s religious history is rich and complicated. This beautiful Cathedral has withstood the test of time and bears testament to Lausanne\u2019s long and fascinating history. The stained glass windows, particularly the rose, are very beautiful and are definitely worth a visit!",
          "The cathedral is in Lauranne's Old Town which is up a very steep hill from the main station. However, apart from the work out the climb will give you, it's worth it as you get great views of around Lausanne from the nearby terrace and the cathedral itself is an impressive gothic",
          "Nice. Visit if you have time. In the summer tends to be overcrowded. Bear it in mind when you plan your visit.",
          "A beautiful Gothic temple with a long history. Very well preserved, the stained glass and statues are amazing and it offers a breathtaking view of the city from the bell tower. Don't miss it while visiting Lausanne!",

          "Very big cathedral and abit of a trek to get to it. However the views from the top are amazing and give a real glimpse of the city. Didn\u2019t get a chance to go in as it was just reaching closing time",
          "Weather permitting, a beautiful, high altitude view of the heart of Lausanne and of its lake. Worth the trip and the photos.",
          "Entry into the building is free and breathtaking! If you are in Geneva do not miss this place! If you want to climb up to the tower, entry fee for adults in 5chf but be prepared to Climb a lot of steep stairs. Once up top however, it is worth every moment!",
          "Huge and magnificent! Piece of art and the best landmark in Lausanne. You can miss it. No guide available",
          "Cathedrale is the most important religious building located in Lausanne, a city in Switzerland. It is located in the upper part of the old town, so you can see it from some places in the city. The building was built in the Middle Ages and now it is a Protestant Cathedral.",
          "Once you've climbed the hundreds of stairs the Cathedral welcomes you like no other, it sits proudly above the city of Lausanne commanding amazing views. Walk through the massive double doors and the Cathedral opens up before your eyes in all its glory, it really is a lovely",
          "I was able to drive up the hill all the way and park right in front of the church's door steps, that was on December 25th, not sure how it would be any other day. It took over a century of construction work before the Protestant Notre-Dame Cathedral of Lausanne was consecrated",
          "It's very beautiful and worth visiting there. From there we get a view of the whole city and the lake and mountains! Very nice indeed.",
          "While in Lausanne, make sure to visit the Cathedrale de Lausanne! Beautiful stained glass windows, a church organ with more than 7000 pipes, wooden benches and statues - I like such places. And... the most adorable thing is that you can pay 5 euros and get to the top of the",
          "The cathedral is one of the most famous places to visit in Lausanne. We enjoyed the steps and walk up to the cathedral more than the church itself. Unfortunately, we were not able to appreciate the beauty of the cathedral as wooden benches and structures were built in the",
          "It is a must-visit place in Lausanne. The cathedral is a very beautiful building, not so interesting on the inside (as it is a typical, austere, catholic cathedral with not many things to see) as on the outside. But what makes the visit really worthy is the breathtaking view of",
          "I was a very happy that we have decided to climb up all the way to the cathedral and discover Lausanne, the beautiful works of art and the view from the place.",
          "A very nice cathedral worth visiting . On the highest part of Lausanne with very nice view . Very nice music instrument .",
          "This is a Notre Dame church.....and for anyone who likes the architecture in Churches it is a must visit, if for one or the other reason you are in Lausanne. The carvings in rock all around are as good as anywhere else in the world. Some of the medieval paint on the walls still",
          "Easily accessible. Great views of the Lake and city from the terrace. Lovely stained glass windows and Rose window. High ceilings with Vaulted arches. Plain Calvinist interiors. Magnificent church organ.",
          "It sits fairly high on the upgrade of the city. Waking up to get there will give you a good workout. Then the steps to the top ensure you won't need a trip to the gym\ud83d\ude00. All worth it though. The views are fantastic. Even got to see a choir practicing on the main level of the",
          "A Cathedral with a beautiful design. Definitely had a bit of work done on it because the arch around the door looks brand new while the rest of the front looks aged in comparison. Inside is vast with a stunning organ and altar at the front. It\u2019s a bit of a climb from the main",

          "I really enjoyed my visit to this lovely gothic cathedral. The rose window, the splendid gates, tje intricate archtecture. A good place to sit down for some introspection. Put on your headfones and listen to J.S. Bach or Faure's requiem, or better yet: go to one of the live",
          "The cathedral is an excellent example of Gothic architecture. The inside is vast and the design is worth the trek up the hill. However, what lacks is the design that was originally in the church before the Reformation. Moreover, remaining objects before the Reformation are",

          "What a beautiful place to visit. The mixed reviews suggested that this wasn't a good place by some but we were very impressed with it. I would recommend that you pay to go up the bell tower and look out at Lausanne from the very top - an excellent view. It is free to get in.",
          "Well worth a visit! Finding this beautiful cathedral was our highlight in Lausanne, the views over the city and out toward the lake are really nice. What we liked most about this cathedral was the detail which has gone into the building, from around the central doorway to",
          "This is the crown jewel of the walking tour of Lausanne and well worth a few extra climbing steps to visit. We enjoyed the stunning architecture, statues, stained glass, organ and grand feel of the Cathedral. It was not our favorite European cathedral but very impressive none",
          "Yes, it is protestant, and calvinist at that, so, no, there is not much extra adornment as that was removed during the rather stern Swiss reformation led by Calvin, a very good friend of John Knox. But my goodness what a beautiful building! And because there are no adornments,",
          "There is a pretty steep climb form the Metro to get to the summit on which the cathedral sits, but given that the historical museum is right beside it, it is worth the effort. For aficionados, it is a classic, well preserved, early Gothic building with several attractive",
          "A glorious cathedral in Lausanne, in the midst of historical buildings and parks. Hearing the bells chime the hour is quite awesome. When you walk inside the cathedral, you are in awe of it's majesty! A must see, when in Lausanne!",
          "Lausanne is extremely hilly, so the easiest way to reach the Cathedral and the Old Town is by using the Metro subway. The Visitor's Information is located right next to the Metro and they were most helpful in telling us which stop to exit for the Cathedral. The Cathedral",
          "Every cathedral that you enter has something different to offer. Beautiful artwork and stained glass. The organ is impressive to view. A nice stop while visiting Lausanne. Nice view from the small plaza outside of the front door.",

          "I was staying in Geneva and decided to take a side trip to Lausanne. Of a few attractions there the cathedral was on top of my list. I didn't regret this decision. Magnificent! Two museums worth checking out across the street, too. A few cozy cafes and bars. Nice view of the",
          "Must visit if you are in the area. Incredible piece of architecture with beautiful stained glass windows. If you have the chance to listen to the organ playing you will get the filling that you are in another world, this place has an incredible acoustic. Even the hike from the",
          "Stunning architecture and stained glass that has been very well renovated (and looks like parts are still being renovated). This is my favorite Cathedral next to Notre Dame in Paris, worth seeing if you are in the area.",

          "One of the most interesting aspects of the Cathedral is the various panels that give information about the figures engraved around the main doorway. However the building itself is also a stunning location to spend some time.",
          "Wonderfully restored cathedral. Take the metro PAST the cathedral and walk down. Walk back down through the steps back to town, passing beautiful old store fronts and interesting cafes.",
          "The history here is interesting, but it\u2019s still an active church. I would expect the church to demand respect from visitor. There are signs posted to be quiet and to not take flash photography. But there were tour guides shouting to their customers, flashes constantly and swarms",

          "I loved walking around this old Gothic cathedral and exploring all the detail work for a while. I especially liked the statues carved into the columns; they had that Middle Ages style of representing people, and I could even see the remnants of red and blue paint that may have",
          "...and for a good reason. After an initial life as a catholic sacred building, it became protestant and never got the luxurious decoration and priceless art that its catholic brethren received. On top of this, in a purely Swiss way, quality of construction is paramount, so",

          "This cathedral was originally Catholic before eventually becoming Protestant. It has been distinguished by both periods and would appear fancy for a Calvinist, but not very expressive for a catholic. There is nothing exceptional that would justify a trip, but if you are in",

          "I liked the clean soaring lines of the structure. No need for frescoes that flake and fade. Simplicity.",
          "I grew up here and took my classes around the corner. We used to hang out in the Cathedral between classes to study. This is a beautiful gothic cathedral, used by many, and relatively unspoiled by the tourist trade. I still feel a reverence every time I walk through it. Outside,",

          "The building is really huge, and gothic in all its details. The ornaments above the entrance are a replica of the original which had been destroyed. This is clearly visible, because the colour is quite different from the rest of the church. The exterior is magnificent,",
          "Take a trip to this cathedral with the walking tour offered by Town Hall i.e. Lausanne en pied. They tell you a lot about the history of this church. Note that at the entrance, there are some beheaded sculptures of Marie, and the walls were colorful which was painted grey",

          "The cathedral itself is lovely, but it's really worth paying to go to the top (you do have to climb a few stairs). The views over Lausanne are beautiful.",
          "Beautiful gothic cathedral. Fantastic stained glass windows. Was really big inside. We also saw the christmas exhibition with the lovely models.",
          "There many ways to reach this wonderful cathedral (Escaliers du Marche, Pont Charles Bessieres\u2026), but from all points it looks equally beautiful and harmonic. Actually, one can spend the whole day there, looking at it\u2019s statues, decorations and glass windows. And the view over",
          "The history and gob smacking lead lighting and architecture make this one of the most interesting cathedral finds of my holiday. I went to Notre Dame, Milan's Duomo and San Marco's et al in Venice and this certainly was special.",
          "I have great recollection of the area surrounding this church. The church itself blends in with the many others I have seen in my life. I don't regret making the climb to the church from my hotel, and it is significantly uphill from where I was staying, but without the",
          "I had wanted to see this building for a long time. It is a centre for reform/protestant worship and is world famous. Inside is the large and very imposing Fisk organ. We enjoyed Sunday morning worship in the church (all spoken in French which we did not understand, but the",
          "Great old-mystic looking church almost like ones you find in movies and games. Hadn't been to the tower but the balcony just outside the door also gave a good view of the city. This place needs English signs and description to let people appreciate this place even more.",
          "This is true historical site. But one would like to see more English and German descriptions etc. Lausanne needs to present its gems to more than a Francophone audience.",
          "A huge cathedral, with an almost ''scary'' entrance, a big black curtine after the big heavy door .... the inside part makes you feel that you are not in today... amazing windows and impressive sound in the cathedral. You have to visit this place.",
          "We are Christians and enjoy seeing how Christian worship spaces vary around the world. This one was memorable, notably for the beautiful stained-glass windows of the church and the high arches over the nave.",
          "Lausanne on a Sunday shuts down! With only 1 day there I was happy we could see the cathedral. There are many many steps leading up to it but if you take them slowly and remember the history behind them, it makes it interesting. The cathedral is in the gothic style and more",
          "Absolutely worth the trip and easy to get to from Lausanne Port d'Ouchy via metro the Cathedral is breath taking and the acoustics are amazing. For a few euros, you can go into the little gift shop and buy a ticket to climb to the top of the tower and look at the bells. They",
          "The cathedral in itself is just beautiful. You really should go in and visit it, for a few coins you can also climb the stairs to the top and have one of the most wonderful views of the city.",
          "They were renovating parts of the cathedral when we visited but the stained glass windows and stonework around the main door is worth seeing. The cathedral has a dark gothic feel which the stained glass emphasises. Outside it is worth a wander around to see the view of the",
          "It is worth the visit. Special place to enjoy for few hours. Take a audio guide if you want to worth it.",
          "We walked all the way up to the cathedral, and then up to the top of the bell tower. View from the top of the stairs by the church was awesome, but if you are dating enough to go up the bell tower, it\u2019s totally worth it. Beautiful views all around. Only 5 SF to walk up.",
          "If you're in the area it's worth a visit to see the stained glass windows and explanations of some of the stone carvings. There is also a good lookout over the city near the front entrance. I wouldn't make a trip specifically to see it though.",
          "During mw trip in Swizerland, my native friend of Lausanne suggest me to visit the cathedrale de Lausanne (i'm a fan of religious monument), and i wasn't disappointed at all. After climbing (too) many step, we stop at the top and the price was very grateful. Indeed, the",
          "The church is very nice and well maintenance. Only a few minutes walk from metro station and you could see panoramic view of the city.",
          "We did our own walking tour and made our way to the cathedral. Would have been better to join a tour and have someone give us history, but the beauty is enough. Great panoramic view of the city outside the cathedral.",
          "I walked here. The walk is lovely walking up many steps. The streets are cobblestone and have great views of Lausanne. I was too late for the tower and it is only 5 francs. The church is lovely inside, and I enjoyed sitting in serenity.",
          "Spoke to a wonderful cathedral guide, who was very knowledgable and helpful. Told us the Cathedral was designed by the same architect who designed Canterbury Cathedral. The organ is amazing.....unfortunately not in use when we were there. I would have loved to have had a",
          "This was my first Swiss cathedral -- I wasn't sure what to expect with all the Catholic trappings stripped out by the Protestants (centuries ago). It's lovely.",
          "Beautiful cathedral high on a hill overlooking Lausanne. Wonderful stained glass windows and a real sense of history. Quite and peaceful site and a great place from which to get a perspective of the city. Well worth the climb up all those stairs",
          "Beautiful chuch in the center of Lausanne. this church is very quiet and nice. I recommand the visit of this church if you are in Lausanne.",
          "Nice cathedral sitting tall on the vertical city of Lausanne, Canton of Vaud. Renovation going on inside. There is guided tour for a fee. Also there is a nominal fee to climb to the top of the bell tower which provides sweeping panoramic view of the lake geneva on one side and",
          "If you have a spare hour or so the Cathedral building and windows is interesting and its location on a hill with great views over the city",
          "The view of Lausanne from the top of the cathedral is beautiful, and the view you can see from the terrace in front of the cathedral is also very nice. The cathedral itself has very intricate carvings and statues at the entrance which are definitely worth seeing. The interior is",
          "The cathedral is lovely. It is interesting to see the difference in atmosphere between a cathedral that is Catholic and one that was \"reformed\". (I am not Christian.) It has a different atmosphere when the statues are removed, and is interesting to me to feel that difference.",
          "If you've visited lots of churches recently, then this one is nothing special. If not, make sure you visit it. It's located above the hill. So put the building aside, you can enjoy the panaromic views of lausanne.",
          "Located in the old town, nice walk around and if you are lucky, you might end up listening a gospel or classic music concert over there..",
          "Visiting this cathedral, you get an appreciation for \"being in the center of a town\". The building is elevate on a hill, and there is a bell tower that gives quite lovely views. The interior is fairly stripped of ornamentation, save for one remaining side chapel. There",
          "An impressive cathedral, definitely worth checking this out. The stained glass windows inside were breathtaking.",
          "Very imposing structure, the cathedral spires are visible from a distance. Inside are stained glass windows and paintings of the scripture on the walls. A solemn place of worship steeped in history.",
          "Huge cathedrals usually make me unconfortable, not this one. On the contrary. The art, the light, the colors, all is easy on the eye and on the mind. I felt peaceful and spent a surprisingly long time there. The small room on the right side of the entrance looks a bit russian.",
          "The statuary at the entrance was the best part for me. The interior is not ornate except some of the stained glass and the magnificent organ. We didn't climb the tower.",
          "Nice church close to old Lausanne. The stained glass work throughout the cathedral is spectacular. The church is world renowned for his amazing and huge organ. The pipes of the organs are arranged to look like an angel with open wings.",
          "After the Reform Movement took over this former Catholic Cathedral, the Reformists painted over the ornate interior in drab grey paint, and further desecrated the statues of revered saints by breaking off their noses. Luckily, these religious zealots didn't smash the beautiful",
          "The cathedral is absolutely stunning - the stained glass windows alone were worth the visit and the interior of the church is breathtaking. Tours are available at various points during the day, free of charge.",
          "Fabulous old cathedral with attractive stained glass windows in the old quarter of Lausanne. A short walk from one of the main market squares the setting could be straight out of a film set. Some quaint restaurants and bars nearby.",
          "Beautiful stained-glass windows, stone carvings, a tower to climb for a view all over town. See the organ, with more than 7000 pipes and 6 keyboards, played in the organ loft or on the movable electronic console in the nave. Recitals generally Friday evenings, with guest",
          "The cathedral is considered one of the most beautiful gothic buildings in Switzerland. Don't miss the panoramic view!!! (5 euros to go to the top).",
          "It is a lovely cathedral but quite a hike to get up to it! Most of this town is 'up or down' an it si worth the effort",
          "I went in at a time when there weren't many people. The place felt like the way I feel Cathedrals are supposed to feel like: quiet and full of prayer. It's calm. From up the bell tower the view is fantastic.",
          "Visited with friends with small children, we went up the bell tower in absolute safety. From that stand point the view is breathtaking. Don't miss the interior of the dome, especially the world class pipe organ. If you have the cha, stay for a concert: the sound is rich and",
          "Calm, restful, gentle.. no big tourist spaces, a place of peace in the middle of the city.. lovely place of contemplation",
          "Very pretty and large cathedral up on the hill in the old section of Lausanne. Beautiful view from up there.",
          "This is a huge cavernous church with very special bell tower. There are very many steps to climb up to the top of the bell tower but the views you get up there are worth every step of the way! We were very fortunate to have an organ player to sit and listen to for a while.",
          "In comparison in other counties sacral monument places Lausanne cathedral seems to be rather sad and empty place. Perhaps joining guided tour could change my impression as I visited it myself. Free entrance was an advantage.",
          "The Cathedral was closed when I got there Friday morning. There was a sign that it was reopening at 2:00 PM, but I missed my chance to see the inside. The outside is lovely, especially at night from our room!",
          "I had been overlooking this building for a while, in my regular visits to Lausanne, and decided to have a peak. Each time I passed by, one section of the fa\u00e7ade was being cleaned and/or fixed. Unlike the expectation, this church is actually protestant, and that's clearly seen in",
          "The Catedral are doing fixed, but its a good place to visit. In the way, you can see beautiful gardens and you can take a lot of photos to register this moment. In the same place, its possible to see part of the city in a vantage vision.",
          "In comparison to Italy or Spain's cathedrals, this is far less impressive. It has magnificent view from outside, but inside does not impress at all.",
          "We walked in to the cathedral just as a service was about to begin. The service was simple, the pastor gentle and the gathered devout. After the service, walked around reading the different elements about the church.",
          "It's a lovely church with fascinating mixture of styles indicating various historical periods. Do pay to go up the tower. If you have any interest in history or want a great view it's worth the climb.",
          "If you're in the general vicinity, I'd recommend a trip to the cathedral - even if a brief one. There are some seriously impressive stained glass windows along with the historic architecture.",
          "Right now (June 2017), this cathedral is under renovation so many parts are closed off. When everything is completed, I am sure that it will be a stunning sight to see and experience...to bad I am already home from vacationing in Switzerland.",
          "This church was a beautiful church high up on the hill. It took some walking and time to get there. It was a beautiful view of the city from there however. The Chateau nearby was under reconstruction unfortunately.",
          "We visited the Cathedral as part of a stroll through the Old Town. Fascinating historically and very peaceful,if you want period of quiet reflection. Absolutely magnificent stained glass windows, worth the visit in themselves.",
          "Beautiful view but the stairs are a danger and not a good idea for someone with mobility issues - there are no handrails! If you are up to it, the views are phenomenal!",
          "Until I saw the sign I didnt realise there were more than one Notre Dame Cathedral but this is an amazingly beautiful cathedral even if it shares a name with others. Love the big circular Window at the front and all the decorative architecture",
          "You can see this Cathedral from the train that I used to take from Geneva to Zermatt. That train has amazing views of Lausanne, A town which housed Audrey Hepburn for the last 30 years of her life. The town looked just like her, from the train, --elegant, polished and slightly",
          "After taking the metro up the number of hills in Lausanne. We arrived at this amazing Cathedrale.It is free to enter. The stain glass windows are great. I did return that night to hear the night watchman do hour call",
          "Its a beautiful 800 year old cathedral also known as Notre Dame of Laussanne. Its easily accessible by the metro station Riponne-M Bejart. Also from behind the Cathedral there is a short-cut passage to the Musee de History.",
          "The walk to get here is quite an odysey, as you have to walk a lot of stairs up in order to get there. However once you get there. There is a nice museum next to it.",
          "the Cathedral was built catholic and was later converted when the reform hit Lausanne. Today it is a very well maintained building with a lot of reading in the inner part of it. Very stripped \"d\u00e9pouill\u00e9\", it has kept all of its original features and gained as well a lot of",
          "Well worth the trip up to see it. A fairly plain cathedral that has had a lot of work done on it. Wonderful views from here.",
          "The top of the cathedral offers a great view of Lausanne. This is not the nicest cathedral, but it is still worth the trip for the nice view. There is a small fee to get on top of the tower.",
          "To reach the cathedral you have to go up more than 300 stair steps approximately , where is was so stressful as the Cathedral is located on top of the hill. From the high point of the Cathedral you can have a full view over all of the City Lausanne I mean the old town.",
          "Lausanne Cathedral is one of the most beautiful Gothic Cathedrals in Switzerland, but it is quite a steep walk from the Lake to the Cathedral. The walk is well worth it to see the city, and the amazing views of the lake and alps. My favourite features of the Cathedral are the",
          "Lausanne Peak with wonderful view on the terrace. The interior of the Cathedral is amazing, very simple and beautiful. The organ with horizontal trumpets is most impressive. Summer shelter from the heat and a place to rest and pray.",

          "A truly impressive cathedral, as beautiful inside as it is on the outside. I fine example of Gothic architecture, with large galleries and vaults, heavily ornate porches and has beautiful painted windows. The huge pipe organ is famous and there are quite a lot of organised",
          "A very nice Cathedral with a fantastic view of Lausanne.... and the mountains, the lake ... Its well worth a visit - don't miss it ! Explore the inner city around this place with nice little Caf\u00e9 houses. Use the Metro to go to this place.",
          "Very nice Cathedral with breathtaking view of Lausanne and surroundings. Protestant Place, so no saints and stuff inside.",
          "Well worth a visit. Take Metro up hill from train station. Beautiful colourful windows. Views of Lausanne from top well worth the visit",
          "Great view from the top and interesting exhibitions about the cathedral as you climb to the top. I was lucky to hear a concert on the organ, unforgettable.",
          "Impressive building on the top of the city. If you are fit I recommend you to walk up to the Cathedral from La Place de La Palud. Is the spiritual capital of the French speaking part of Switzerland. In the inside you can see all the polychromy. Very nice view to the city from",
          "Good to walk up here on a sunny day. Try to walk on up via Escaliers du Marche. The Lausanne Cathedral itself is very nice and need a walk thru the interior. But the view outside is even better. The local offers a good view of the whole town and the lake.",

          "The Cathedrale is the crown jewel of the Old City or La Cit\u00e9 of Lausanne and is considered to be one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Europe. It is right in the Centre and so it makes for a very nice part of a walk about the downtown area. I highly recommend it.",

          "The church is huge, imposing and is located in a hill that has a nice view to the city. However, inside it`s just ok. It worth going there, but lower your expectations and enjoy the view.",
          "The catedral is a very pure early gothic style, very harmonious and perfectily restored, a visit is a must. And the nave is very impressive. Also the stained-glass-windows are beautiful.",
          "This was a great quick stop in Lausanne. I would recommend a visit here for sure. The church was beautiful and had free entry. The belfry tower does cost money and we did t have time to make the climb up. Perhaps next visit.",
          "At the top of Lausanne but you can get there on the Metro. Enjoy the large rather stark stone interior which contrasts with the highly colourful and historic stained glass windows. You'll see and possibly hear the large church organ, but can you find the much smaller and",

          "An interesting cathedral: gothic bones with numerous changes well explained. The painted porch and Marian shrine were unlike any other I had seen. A full gothic rose window as rarely seen. Not as huge as Chartres or others, but very worth seeing. And, on the cold Winter day,",
          "The cathedral of Lausanne is quite famous in the area of lake Geneva. To get there just follow the streets up and take the wooden stairs up to hill where the cathredral lies. From the terrace in front of the church you will have a great view over the city, the lake and the",

          "On a sunny day the cathedral looks sparkling and bright. The architecture inside and out is beautiful and the colours in the glass look amazing. This cathedral puts the cathedral in Geneva to shame....that one is grey and cold. We all thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Lausanne",
          "Wander around inside and enjoy the atmosphere. Think back many centuries d think of the vision and craftsmanship it would take to build something so grand. To enter is free. Go slowly. Pause to look at the stained glass windows.",
          "While visiting Lausanne with my family we made our way up the hill to the cathedral. After walking around the exterior we made our way inside and noticed that tours were available of the bell tour and crypt. Our guide took our family down through the locked gate to the crypt.",

          "If you're in Lausanne and you like this kind of monuments... You must arrange some time to walk in the streets near the cathedral and visit it. I woul recommend to check if any concert is scheduled. The cathedral has a huge Iberia pipe organ and concerts usual.",
          "I went into the cathedral during a very rainy afternoon as a way of seeking refuge from the torrents of rain that fell in Lausanne that day. But the insides of the cathedral was breath-taking ! I wish I had a guide with me to explain the history of the sculptures or a bit of",

          "Usually I'm not a big fan of cathedrals or churches, but this one is actually very nice and interesting to visit. I liked it that it is almost bare of ornaments, besides the beautiful colored glass windows. Didn't spend there too much time -- maybe 15 or 20 minutes -- and it",
          "It is very sad to hear about the wonderful decorations and colors which were purposely taken down by the austere protestants taking over from the Catholics. There is a special room for pilgrims which is worth visiting and a tomb with an unusual story as well as spectacular",
          "From the moment you enter this cathedral you are gripped by its history. Building started in the 12th Century and its antiquity is evident. That said you can see the evidence of its development over the centuries with a magnificent new organ taking centre stage. A place of peace",

          "Travelling around Switzerland we decided to stop in the beautiful city of Lausanne. We made a bee-line, albeit a slow one, for the Cathedral. What we didn't realise is the size of the climb and the number of steps we would have to ascend. When we got there the cathedral is",

          "Visited the cathedral briefly. The cathedral itself is magnificent, and the view earned from climbing from the surprisingly easy staircase is tremendous",
          "We enjoyed walking to the Cathedrale from our hotel. The area surrounding it has an incredible view of the city. Inside, they are doing a bit of construction so that might be a distraction. It is still very lovely. I would go back.",

          "At the end of July the cathedral was largely covered for renovation on the outside and e.g. the main entrance was not accessible. There was an exhibition about how the Christian animal symbols have been adopted from earlier traditions, which would interest a secular person too.",
          "The Cathedral is a 5 minute walk across the bridge and up the hill from the metro stop. Beautiful views over the whole city. The lady who gives the free tour of the cathedral is very good, speaks excellent English and explained a lot about the cathedral, its beautiful stained",
          "Lovely gothic cathedral on the top of Lausanne. The stairs will do you good but, the views from the top makes it all worth while. Absolutely beautiful! Do go if you get the chance. A lovely little traditional cafe mid stairs as well :)",
          "The location is at the heart of the city. Elevated. Great views of city. Walks around the cathedral with bars, cafes, little galleries etc. A good open air cafe just near the steps leading up to it from the Riponne Square (and history museum). Lovely cathedral. Fascinating",
          "There are not many places to visit in this town and this is biggest and best church to visit. There is another one St Francis that is also easy to visit both would take less than an hour. The waterfront walk is best part of Lausanne",
          "It is small and not exuberant, but for people loving churches it is a good visit. I would recommend going up the tower to see the view.",
          "The most impressive gothic cathedral in Switzerland demands that you go inside. The Rosette is beautiful and the quality of the stained glass is very very high. You can fully appreciate it when the sun is high in the sky - I was lucky to visit around 11 am. The sun came through",
          "An impressive Cathedral. It has some beautiful stained glass windows. The organ, however, is fascinating. It has 7000 pipes. It was one of the first organs to be designed by an actual designer. Enter the Cathedral at 1 of the big wooden doors. If you are walking up from the",
          "If you are visiting Lausanne, then you will eventually find yourself at the cathedral. Very impressive building, but be prepared to walk uphill! The cathedral is at the top of the steep hill on which the city is built.",
          "Lots of stairs to get up to it, but it is BEAUTIFUL! I wouldn't take young kids, but 8+ years should be fine. Go see it! The windows are amazing!",
          "We did not have time to go inside, but we walked around the grounds and this cathedral in the centre of Lausanne is a true beauty. Right near the cathedral are spectacular views overlooking Lausanne and you can see the alps in the far horizon and the city underneath from the",
          "The interior of this cathedral is truly stunning -- there are so many unique features! There are special displays talking about the representation of various animals in the stonework and the changes over the years (for instance, a unicorn was once considered an evil beast), the",
          "The cathedral is a interesting place to visit, considering the location and other things you can do nearby. However, it has different art styles at the same building (it might be confusing if you pay attention to the details).",

          "After eating lunch I walked up here with my friends and their young child. It was uphill however not super difficult to get to since there are stairs up to the cathedral. The views once to get to the cathedral are breathtaking and worth going there even if you don't have a",
          "This is often touted as the greatest cathedral in Switzerland. Well, if you want to see a great cathedral you will have to go elsewhere in Europe. Worth a look if you are walking around Lausanne but not worth a side trip.",
          "We stayed just 5 minutes away from the Cathedral and on a light day decided to go see it. Beautiful and can be done in less than an hour. do check the timings as it opens i think at 10am if I can remember clearly. The stained glass was pretty and the huge organs very",
          "It's free so were saying but oh my goodness the set of steps. It has some beautiful stained glass windows but otherwise it's plain. It's free so it's worth walking to.",
          "The cathedral is magnificent itself with a few hundreds years history and it's a good culture learning experience to be here as you can tell the differences among catherals in different countries of Europe. Here in this catharel, there are many plates in bronze on the wall",
          "Worth a visit to see the beautiful stained glass windows. There is also an large impressive church organ. I have seen other more ornate churches and cathedrals but this is worth a visit if you are in Lausanne. It is their landmark building. You are allowed to take photos inside.",
          "From the train station in Lausanne the Cathedral can be reached easily walking or taking the Metro (Station Riponne-M. B\u00e9jart). The Cathedral dates is in Gothic style and dates back to the 12th century. The view from the hill on the Lac L\u00e9man is great. From there one can explore",
          "Gorgeous stained glass windows and spectacular views over the city from the terraced walls outside. Lovely.",

          "No matter your time in Lausanne, this cathedral is not to be missed. Beautiful stained glass. I enjoyed seeing the organ and would recommend an organ concert though it didn't fit our timing. Explanations of Christian symbolism along the side wall were very well done. The",
          "This is a really beautiful cathedral with incredible stain glass, wonderfully quiet corners and an amazing organ. It is free to visit and I think has guided tours.",
          "This was a very good tour and well worth it to go with a group to hear about the history of it. When we got there we got to go to the front of the line cause of the tickets we had gotten and the tour we were on. The cathedral is amazing.",
          "Impressive cathedral. If you have little time and want to visit one famous building in Lausanne this is the one to pick!",

          "Being non-Christian we were not planning to spend a lot of time in the cathedral , but we went in and found that there is a free guide tour offered. We took help from that gentlemen. He wasn't fluid in English but was food enough for us to get enriched with information on the",

          "The cathedral is very beautiful and has a massive pipe organ in the gallery above the rear entrance. Although you have to climb quite a bit to get to it the 360 degree of Lausanne and the Alps is beautiful. Although Europe is full of Amazing cathedrals and may be this isn't in",
          "It is a must if you are in Lausanne, but do not wait anything special. It is under renovation so you cannot even see the whole building in its original shape.",
          "This cathedral is the main highlight of the city of Lausanne and it's famous for its Rose Window, although you need to incline your head and probably use the binoculars to enjoy the patterns of the zodiac. Or you could just head to the gift shop and get the postcard version.",
          "We walked to the cathedral from the train station, it took less than 20 minutes and was a nice walk although it was up hill. Once up to the cathedral the view was amazing! Inside is a beautiful church that has been there for hundreds of years. We must have picked the timing",
          "Great place to visit. The church traces its roots back to the early 13th century. The towers and belfry were added over most of the century that followed. The interior is marvelous with parts of some original wall paintings(frescos?) still visible. Information about the",
          "Historically impressive, lovely outside. But a cold spirit overall inside. Maybe it's the weather? An under leveraged, under appreciated tourism asset.",
          "Very quiet day, only 1-2 other people there. Calm and contemplative inside. Lovely light through windows. Gift/guide shop closed when we were there. Located up some major steps if you are coming from the Lake area (Lausanne is on a hill, can't recall too many flat areas)",
          "Nice place but it was closed when we were visiting. Nearby there are plenty of places for shopping and shopping centers so that the atmosphere is complete.",
          "As with many churches a great old building but with the added interest of a new art exhibition looking at animals in the architecture and fittings. Could also get up the tower (for a fee of course) which gave a great view over this larger than expected city. Worth the trip and",

          "The building is beautiful inside and out. There are points of interest everywhere you look and has been beautifully maintained. The only reason it's not a 5 is that we couldn't get in to see a few bits because they were full of equipment for stonework I assume was taking place.",
          "Lovely cathedral with amazing stained glass windows. Definitely worth visiting and it is located high enough so that you have great views of Lausanne.",
          "A very good place to visit with a nice view over the city. You can see that it is not a flat city :-)",
          "Quite an impressive building. High on a hilltop so the view from the towers is just breathtaking. You can notice some absurd modern engineering additions to a medieval cathedral.",
          "This is the biggest in Switzerland, it's very nice. Especially the windows are very very pretty. The view is amazing, you can look out ove Lausanne",
          "What an amazing place to see. Just the architecture and the massive feat it must have been to build this so long ago. Definitely worth a stop and some pictures.",
          "This Cathedral is so worth taking the time to walk around inside and out. The architecture alone is incredible and once inside you can't help but look up! We came on a day that someone was practicing on the pipe organ. A truly unforgettable moment! Highly recommend worth",
          "It feels like no matter where you find yourself in Lausanne, there are always a few stairs to climb. The cathedral is no exception, but the view over Lausanne is amazing. We visited on Sunday afternoon so we did not have much time before the evening sermon started, but",
          "The historical center of Lausanne, up the hillside, is beautiful and the cathedral is the most imposing architectural piece there. Worth a visit!",
          "Lots to look at, lovely & interesting stained-glass windows! The view from the terrace down to the city & lake, with the Alps in the background, is breathtaking",
          "It is really a special place. If only for it\u00b4s location. Even without knowing much about its history, I enjoyed very much looking at the monument , the architecture and admiring the whole of lausanne from there!",
          "If old buildings are your thing then a visit to the cathedral is not going to disappoint. There's a few steps to climb if you approach the building from the square below. Inside is dry and clean and pretty much what you'd expect - the interior bears a striking resemblance to my",
          "We visited on a sunny day and it made the experience so much better; the sunlight through all the stained glass windows was stunning. We were also lucky that someone was playing the organ, a 7,000 pipe incredible instrument high up in the building. The sound was unbelievable.",
          "Very old Gothic Cathedral located on the top of the hill dominates the landscape of Lausanne. I was not too impressed with the interior, except for the bright and beautiful stained glass windows of the altar. The exterior is heavily restored and somewhat lost its original",
          "Still a house of prayer and yet a lovely place to visit if not religious - tower has fantastic views of the city but so does area outside the cathedral. Very friendly staff in small unobtrusive shop",
          "One of the largest organs of Switzerland is housed in this Cathedral. The glass wndows are fantastic! A special feature are the painted scultptures in the old entrance, On the south of the cathedral. (visit from inside the cathedral , since no access from the outside).",
          "The view over the city and lake from outside is as beautiful as the inside, especially the windows. A must if you pass by lausanne.",
          "What is great with the cathedral is not only that we can see it from almost everywhere in Lausanne, it's because it's really on top of the city. With its asymmetric missing beffroi, on top of Escaliers du march\u00e9, it's a pleasure to visit. Notable elements are the polychromy that",
          "Excellent views over the old town from cathedral close, and a spacious building inside with a considerable amount of impressive stained glass",
          "I went to Lausanne Cathedral with my friends. We walked to the cathedral from the train station, it was long and uphill, but the sight was breath taking. We climbed up to the tower of the cathedral, the stairs are a little narrow. The entrance for the cathedral is free, but you",
          "The gothic architecture is very impressing, but I was expecting to see more richness inside the cathedral. In any case it is worth a visit. I assume that the organ concert should be great, but unfortunately I did not had opportunity to listen to it.",
          "The church is historical and majestic just like most of the churches in switzerland. We visited during the christmas concert. May be I am not a church music enthusiast but the concert was a pain in the ears.",
          "It was truly worthwhile walking up the hill to find this magnificent historical Gothic cathedral. It's beautiful carved walls resonate with the messages of is founding saints. It captures the beauty of Lausanne in an amazing way. Has a place to sit and meditate. Felt like a",
          "Very beautiful painted portal. The carving is a delight. The story telling in the carvings is fascinating.",
          "It is a historic Cathedrale on the top of a small hill. The glass windows are very beautiful. It is said the best in Swiss.",
          "Magnificent Gothic building, a real historic site. Don\u2019t miss \u201cle portail peint\u201d - original medieval painting on sculpture. And while in that area, there are the museums a few steps from the Cathedral, also the castle (\u201cCh\u00e2teau\u201d) of Lausanne. Then there is the view over Lausanne",
          "It is a typical Gothic cathedral. Recently renovated. It is located on top of a hill, so from the 'balcony' adjoining the front of the cathedral, you have a view over the old town, all the way up to the lake of Geneva. For more spectacular views over the town, climb up the tower",
          "We were couple of friends visiting this cathedral.Its architecture was awesome.While you enter,you can feel a spiritual atmosphere and it's good to sit there for a while and think...",
          "The cathedral is very nice, as well as the route to get there through the old town and the views from the panoramic location on top of town",
          "It is situated in the centre of Lausanne, so really easy to go there ! It is beautiful and really big ! Must see it !",
          "This was an awesome church to explore, and to photograph as well! The CHF 5- climb to the top of the tower is well worth it too!",
          "It is on the top of the hill of Lausanne. Well, Lausanne itself is very hilly in nature but you might have hard time climbing up there. However, it is beautiful. The cathedrale and the view you can see from the Cathedrale is amazing. Must visit if you are in Lausanne.",
          "After traveling through Italy and France where the cathedrals are very ornate it was nice to visit a cathedral with beautiful arches and stained glass that was not too over the top.",
          "The cathedrals stand on one of the 3 hills of the city and can be seen from all around. Originally built by successive unknown masons, the cathedral was completed in the 18th and 19th century with restorations directed by Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. Thus, added to the",
          "An interesting cathedral with a modern looking organ of a design I had not seen before. As with most cathedrals it's at the top of one of the many hills and is a steep climb; I recommend you take the bus nearly to the top and then walk down. Excellent views over the town from up",
          "Big cathedral. There are wonderful big stained glass so you need to go inside during a sunny day. Inside is without sculptures and pictures.",
          "This Cathedrale in Lausanne is really wonderful. You can see the different colourful windows. And you don't have to pay an admission fee.",
          "One of the most imposing attractions from Lausanne that is really nice to have a look at it. Still need to make some exercise to get to it being situated on top of a hill from where you can see the beauty of city.",
          "When you look from outside, it is one of those huge scarry cathedrales. The windows were so gorgeous. The blue color, amazing! I enjoyed looking at the windows alot. However, since there were so many people entering and leaving it is hard to feel a quiet and relax environment in",
          "Wonderful cathedral in the old city of Lausanne. Take your time to admire the view from the courtyard, to stroll around in the small streets, to visit the shops, the bars and the artisans. It is worth it!",
          "The Cathedral was under renovation when we visited so unfortunately large parts were not accessible and the noise of the workers ruined the atmosphere. Stained glass windows were impressive and the tombs at the front of the Cathedral also.",
          "It has a very nice view which you can see whole view of Lausanne at the front of the Cathedral. Inside of Cathedral, it was very huge and you can see a beautiful old structures.",
          "Superb view from there on Lausanne city The cathedrale in itself is not a must see attraction but nice walk from railway station or place st Fran\u00e7ois.",
          "The Cathedral is nice, with an interesting architecture, especially outside. The Church can be visited during the day; also the tower can be visited, even if the schedule should be checked in place. In front of the Cathedral, across the street, there is a wide terrace which",
          "This is a simple, yet nice to visit cathedral. The view from the city just outside is impotent. If you are lucky there might be someone playing the huge organ inside.",
          "Easy walk up steps from the M2 metro stop. Not as artistically fancy inside as most Italian cathedrals. But that is to be expected. Nice stained glass. They were rehearsing on the organ during my visit.",
          "This is one of the main attraction of lausanne so you should not miss this. You can also go of the top of the tower to have an amazing view of the city",
          "We walked up the hill to take, originally , a look at the outside of this monument but when we got there we ventured inside. An impressive display of architecture and engineering. Not being religious I still appreciated the vastness and impressive nature of this building and",
          "Amazing building with such a long history. The architecture, stain glass windows, carvings and crypts are worth stopping to admire. The size of the organ and acoustics of the cathedral would be amazing. Additionally, the view from the front courtyard over Lausanne is fabulous.",
          "One of the highlights in the area, a place to find your solace and peace. Highly recommend a visit if you are in town. Magnificent in style and grandeur.",
          "So beautiful and awesome. Daunting, really. To imagine the artists & craftsmen from hundreds and hundreds of years ago designing a building of this magnitude is unimaginable. To God's Glory. Amen.",
          "This Cathedral is maybe one of the most important Gothic buildings in Switzlerland. Make sure you'll walt there from downtown to enjoy charming streets of Lausanne. For those who can't go by stairs maybe taxi as there are lot's of steps",
          "We visited the church just about an hour before closing time and had a surprised. The church organist started playing on the old church organ and everyone just stood still and listened to the beautiful pieces he was playing. The church was so peaceful, quiet and clean.",
          "Although I've seen other cathedrals that stunned me more, this one was quite pretty. It had some nice windows and a great organ above the main entrance. Part of the draw is the view from the cathedral over the lower town - gorgeous! Worth even a quick stop (I would've liked to",
          "This Cathedral is located at the top of the hill in old town. It's worth the walk all the way up it. Even though we visited on a cloudy day, it was still very pretty.",
          "Another reviewer said \"an average old church.\" I, however, went to hear Mozart's Requiem and it was more than Splendid. European churches can seem old, dank, and basically dead, but if you can visit during a concert the place comes alive and the walls, organ and stain glass",
          "We only considered visiting the cathedral as we were in Lausanne on a public holiday weekend and there was next to nothing open or to do. We had seen many cathedrals already on our travels through Europe but this one took us by surprise in its own right. Apart from its",
          "This old roman cathedral is very impressive and really worth visit! It situated on to of the hill with beautiful views on the city and the Leman lake. It possesses one of the most beautiful stained glass windows I have seen in a church! If you can, climb the tower, it's only 5",
          "A must for those who are into history and architecture. Walk up to top of the main tower and enjoy views of the city, the lake and the alps.",
          "This is a very important European Cathedral, perhaps not the biggest but its architecture is sublime. The stained glass windows count as some of the best anywhere which is good because there no art whatsoever inside it being now and has for some time been a Protestant building,",
          "Climbed the 174 steps to this Cathedral but found it is a bit lacklustre. Nice from the outside, but felt the interior rather plain compared to many we have visited. View over the rooftops of Lausanne is ok, but didn't feel it was worth the walk.",
          "There is something truly magnificent about this cathedral and it would be a real shame not to visit it (and the surrounding area) when visiting Lausanne. I just cannot recommend it more highly.",
          "Not much to see in Lausanne so why not visit here. Not that impressive but nice.Then walk around and have a meal somewhere",
          "Another landmark at Lausanne. Nothing to shout about but it is quite an interesting structure. Do visit around Lausanne town.",
          "I'm not a very religious sort, but I like my cathedrals filled with beauty. I can completely understand a purist Protestant's objections to all of those craven images, but I really wish that rather than destroying often wonderful artworks, that you'd just built your own church.",
          "It was a beautiful cathedral to look through and enjoy. The cathedral itself is free but you pay 5 Francs to climb the tower but it was well worth it, there is a lot to see and it is stunning. This was hands down one of the best cathedrals and towers I visited my whole trip",
          "It was fun ... we enjoyed the old street towards the church and the view of city is breath taking. Churh is gothic style and beautiful stain glass...",
          "If/when you'll visit this very nice town, you'll HAVE TO spend some time to the cathedrale. Built at XIIe you've a FANTASTIC view of that town from there(or even better, from the towers(CHF 5.-). Tip of the day: you should come back BY NIGHT. From the XVe a (REAL/LIVE) official",
          "I am not a huge fan of Church visits. On this occassion I was passing and noticed entry was free! The Cathedral is less ornate than many and together with the beautiful stained glass windows I have to confess being very pleased I was curious this time. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral up on the hill. I especially enjoyed seeing the painted walls. Not as bright as in medieval times, but enough to help you visualize what it actually looked like.",
          "Incorporated with Visit to old city and the Palais de Rumines.. this is a great experience .. beautiful views over rooftops of city to Lake Geneva.",

          "The Cathedrale of Lausanne is definitely worth a visit when in Lausanne. Easily accessable by the Metro (M2) stopping at Riponne or parking your car in the Riponne parking garage.",
          "Met up with a friend who allowed us up the Cathedral at night. An absolutely amazing view and we shouted down to the citizens of the town that the city was safe and that it was 1am. A great attraction for tourists for the view, history and experience!",
          "This cathedral is a beautiful work of art and religion. I wish I could attend mass here to be able to heaar the choir and just enjoy this beautiful chruch. Even if your not religious I would come here to witness this beautiful building.",
          "Admission to the cathedral is by visitor-decided donation, and a free multilingual map/guide is available. The main way to tour the cathedral is via placards on the walls, which were in English, French, and German. The belfry area had a mandatory charge that you pay in the gift",
          "To get here, take the Metro to the Bessieres stop. The cathedral is easy to find from there (it\u2019s a tall building, so very visible), but be cautioned that it\u2019s a somewhat steep walk up a small-medium hill. The highlight of the cathedral was its sculptures and exterior. Unlike",
          "This being my first visit to an old cathedral of any kind, I was quite awed by the grandeur and architecture, along with the impressiveness of any building being dated back to the 1200's. One thing that detracted me from the experience though was the restoration work that's",
          "The Cathedral is set at the top of a hotel and despite being Switzerland's largest would be dwarfed by Saint Paul's, Florence's Duomo and many others. That said, it's very attractive and has a great atmosphere for prayer inside. There's also a very affordable tower feature that",
          "High above the town (Lausanne is all up and down). The Cathedral is a must see. Lovely stained glass.",
          "It's quite modern as a cathedral. Beautiful, but did not make my heart beating like crazy. However, make sure it's on your list of visit. The view you will get on Lausanne is splendid - super photoes guaranteed! Best time is probably Saturday, when on the square below there is",
          "The cathedral sits perched above Lausanne so expect a workout but also expect to be rewarded with a pretty amazing view. Make sure you take the Escalier du Marche for the way back down.",
          "Nicely refurbished but not one of my favourites ... It simply can't tip to the sagrada familia, Notre dame, sint-baafs ... And many other cathedrals in the EU.",
          "After a climb up the steep hill from the train station, up lovely old winding streets, there are a final flight of covered steps to go up to reach the top. Whilst this is pretty it can be drain on a very hot day, like when we visited, or take your time if one of your party",
          "It has an amazing architecture it is worth seeing it plus from there you have an amazing view of Laussane . It you have time you should see the concerts that are offered at the cathedral",

          "I like this building, the view from the old town is great and the inside is beautiful with gorgeously crafted windows. I live in the area but had never been to the top until today. There are 224 steps to reach the highest point and it will only cost you 2 Chf per adult. Totally",
          "Very nice place, excellent view if you go up the tower or even if you don't. Its already on a hill so the view of Lausanne and the lake is great anyway. The tower is not too high to climb, I think just a couple of hundred steps.",
          "take the subway up the hill to old town. If you come in by train think about going to old town before going down to the harbor. The cathedral is an easy walk from the subway stop. No charge together in. Typical European cathedral. Beautiful windows. Take your time.",

          "Nothing special as European cathedrals go, this one is ok, and not much more. Highlight is the view over the rooftops of Lausanne toward distant Lake Geneva, a view that one can get by walking across the plaza. Located in downtown Lausanne, so one might as well see it if one",

          "We enjoyed wandering in the cathedral, which was beautiful. Our favorite part was hiking up the steps to see the views of Lausanne from the top! We love getting to a \"high point\" in a town/city and being able to get our bearings from the top of the tower. This, was no",
          "Cathedral looks great. Old building with massive stained glasses. Open form 9am. Well worth to visit. There is a terrace outside where you could admire amazing view of the city. Well worth sent 15 minutes.",
          "A very interesting cathedral - well worth taking a tour to hear about the night watchmen who still call the hour, since the Middle Ages. Great views over the city",
          "One of the best cathedral around Europe, great view from the tower and a very nice place to relax for a while. Absolutely cristal sound if you have the chance to attend a concert in the cathedral.",

          "As most cathedrals, this church has gone trough many alterations and restorations (construction began in 1175, one hundred years later the church was consecrated by Pope Gregory X). It remains one of the most important Gothic churches in Switzerland. The so-called \"painted",
          "Because this cathedral was stripped of all opulent decorations during the Reformation, the architecture takes center stage. There is a grand, almost austere, presence about the place. My visit was enhanced by an unexpected organ concert, which was utterly enthralling. Be sure",
          "If you are into visiting churches - go to the cathedral of Lausanne. When you are really fit you can go up the tower (quite some steps to take).",
          "Worth a visit if you are in Lausanne, but those who like ornate and somptuous churches will be deceived by the austerity and severity of this cathedral",
          "The stained glass is worth a look but the real interest is the view from the top. You have to climb the stairs but the view from out on the roof of the tower is well worth the effort.",

          "The cathedral, itself, is like many found scattered throughout Europe. However, its location provides great views of the city and we enjoyed exploring the area around the cathedral. If you are visiting Lausanne for the day, it is worth the walk up to its location.",

          "This cathedral may not have the marble and opulence of those in Italy, but it has a subtle grandeur that matches that of the town. Climb the bell tower for an amazing view of the city!",
          "A very nice cathedral but compared to others in Europe, not a stand out. The views from the plaza in front of the cathedral overlooking the city make this a worthwhile visit. The old town surrounding the cathedral is also a nice area to explore.",
          "The absolute landmark of Lausanne. Inside the Cathedral, you will see one of the so called Big Organs, which is quite impressive. On some specfic sundays that are some concerts with free entrance. After visiting the Cathedral, go down the wooden stairs and on your right there is",

          "We wondered around the old part of town using Rick Steve's city walk guide. This is pretty to look at on the outside and has some stunning natural light photo opportunities on on the inside. Once inside, make sure you go around on the left to the back of the front of the",

          "It is a bit of an uphill walk from Lausanne Central Station but it is worth it. You don't have to pay you just walk in. Inside it is a very impressive place to be, the architecture is fascinating. There is a nice bar just along the road to have a beer in once you are finished.",

          "This is a very beautiful Cathedral. It is in town centre and easily visited during a walk around that area. An added bonus was a unique and creative textile exhibit of 28 works entitled \"From Advent to Passiontide\" which is beautifully displayed in the stunning interior. It is",

          "The Cathedral and its surrounding are a must-see. Beautiful stained glass windows, some immense, and artistically carved pillars and walls. At the far end inside the church, catacombs of historical individuals, some with carved statues. From the cathedral large plaza, you will",
          "Tho whole city is realy pleasant and it was quite enjoy to walk along the streets. The Cathedrale is situated at the place where the view almost reaches left and right frontier of the Lousanne city. Leman (Geneva) lake looks amazing from the place where the Cathedrale is placed.",
          "It's definitely worth seeing! The cathedral is monumental, and the architecture of the building itself is exceptional!It's located in the upper part of the city center,so it over looks the city and that's why you can make some great photos from up there.Once inside,it doesn't",

        "wiki": "Outsider art is art by self-taught or na\u00efve art makers. Typically, those labeled as outsider artists have little or no contact with the mainstream art world or art institutions. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states, unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.\nThe term outsider art was coined by art critic Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut (French: [a\u0281 b\u0281yt], \"raw art\" or \"rough art\"), a label created by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples psychiatric hospital patients and children.Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream \"art world\" or \"art gallery system\", regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work. A more specific term, \"outsider music\", was later adapted for musicians.\n\n\n== Art of the mentally ill ==\n\nInterest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children and the makers of \"peasant art\", was first demonstrated by \"Der Blaue Reiter\" group: Wassily Kandinsky, Auguste Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej Jawlensky, and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac. During World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives'.\nInterest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein Geisteskranker als K\u00fcnstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) about Adolf W\u00f6lfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. W\u00f6lfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. W\u00f6lfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf W\u00f6lfli Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern.\nA defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia. In hospital he painted, producing The Maze, a dark depiction of his tortured youth. He was transferred from the Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with Edward Adamson (1911\u20131996), a pioneer of art therapy, and creator of the Adamson Collection.\n\n\n== Jean Dubuffet and art brut ==\n\nFrench artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he called art brut or raw art. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art Brut along with other artists, including Andr\u00e9 Breton. The collection he established became known as the Collection de l'art brut. It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nDubuffet characterized art brut as: \n\n\"Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses \u2013 where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere \u2013 are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade.\" \u2014 Jean Dubuffet. Place \u00e0 l'incivisme (Make way for Incivism). Art and Text no.27 (December 1987 \u2013 February 1988). p.36  Dubuffet's writing on art brut was the subject of a noted program at the Art Club of Chicago in the early 1950s.Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem \u2013 only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated.\n\n\n== Cultural context ==\nThe interest in \"outsider\" practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, for example, abandoned \"painterly\" technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to re-contextualize existing \"readymade\" objects as art. Mid-century artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of \"primitive\" societies, the unschooled artwork of children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut \u2013 of the insane and others at the margins of society \u2013 is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nA number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as \"outside\" of official culture.  Definitions of these terms vary and overlap.  The editors of Raw Vision, a leading journal in the field, suggest that \"Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary\". Consequently, they lament the use of \"outsider artist\" to refer to almost any untrained artist. \"It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or na\u00efve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name.\"\n\nArt Brut: literally translated from French means \"raw art\";  'Raw' in that it has not been through the 'cooking' process: the world of art schools, galleries, museums. Originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely outside culture and society. Strictly speaking it refers only to the Collection de l'art brut.\nFolk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe \u2013 though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill \u2013 everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society's mainstream.\nIntuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, Visionary Art unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art.  The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.\nMarginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve Invention; refers to artists on the margins of the art world.\nNa\u00efve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to \"normal\" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists.\nNeuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the Collection de l'art brut.\nVisionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists \u2013 range from decorated houses, to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The Palais Ideal by Ferdinand Cheval.\n\n\n== Notable outsider artists ==\nNick Blinko (born 1961) is an English musician and artist diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method).

Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation.

          "located out in the green, in nice park area, this museum had a great temporary exhibition from the Buehrle collection, including some really amazing paintings (my favorite: Soutine and Modigliani). the permanent collection however looks rather poor. so better to check what is",
          "We climbed a steep hill to find this museum. At first, it looked rather small, but we realized that it has a rather large basement. We thoroughly enjoyed the collection of French Impressionist art.",
          "The expos here are always top qualitiy, this time it was Manet,C\u00e9zanne,Monet and Van Gogh etc really great. Not cheap to get in frs 19 and quite a few people even if we were rather early in the day. we had to move around others to see the paintings and wait for them to move on.",

          "if you have no transportation facility, just buy a deadly ticket for all type of transportation or ask your hotel and you will receive one free. In most of Swiss cities its now the case .I start with this detail because the museum called Fondation de l'Hermitage is up the hill",

          "In 1871, the banker Bunion purchased a peace of land above Lausanne and built a stately mansion on it. The villa of the Hermitage Foundation solely houses changing art exhibition. What is permanent is the magnificent view of Lake Geneva and Notre-Dame Cathedral. In the moment",
          "Spent a wonderful morning with an impressive collection of Art Brut.... though it seems these were secondary works of basquait, Cy Twombly. The Jean Dubuffets were a joy to see, as were the works of many other well known artists of the movement. The estate and the villa itself",
          "I spent a lovely day at the Grand Mont, the highlight of which was visiting the Hermitage. 4 stories of art hosted in an intriguing house with probably the best view in Lausanne, set in a country garden. The cafe gave me the best meal I had in Lausanne - and it was complemented",
          "Enjoyed an hour here looking at the modern art collection. Some unique pieces involving meccano but also some bewilderingly talentless roughly painted canvas (on a different plane to me clearly) House itself must have been lovely but no furniture remains -one room had some links",
          "We had the Swiss Pass, so that meant out trip was essentially free. FYI You need to out your bag in a locker. When we were there the exhibition wasn't too interesting, but the location is really nice.",

          "The exhibits we saw were very well presented: modern artists from the 19-20th century. The displays were not crowded and we could get up close to study technique. Staff are friendly. One of the hidden delights was the parquet floor which was in excellent condition and a",
          "Beautiful settings and I love the guided tours and very competent staff I definitely always come back for every exhibiton",
          "Visit this place if you have the Swiss Pass and if it's along your way. I did this while planning to hike towards the Sauvabelin Tower and its entrance fee is covered by the Swiss Pass (CHF18). This is essentially an art museum and depending on the season, maybe they will",
          "Amazing place the house is just stunning and the permanent exposition is really nice. I have been there to the SIGNAC une vie au fil de l eau. No words to describe this unique style of great Frech painter.",
          "I was invited as a client of a bank. It turned out that this exhibition is most interesting. There is a large variety of work of Paul Signac, where we can witness his evolution. The comments of the guide were fascinating. Seats are present in nearly every room so that elderly",

          "I have visited several exhibitions at this Museum (Hopper, Modernismo, Fen\u00eatres among others). All exhibitions are always very broad and informative. The museum tends to be full as it's popular all over Switzerland and known for its top exhibitions. The museum however was built",
          "Good choice of art and the exhibitions change several times per year, and there is a great library. A very nice coffee shop/cafetaria next door. The area is green and lush. Parkling is a bit complicated, but if you do not mind a short walk, you find lots of space \"up-the-hill\".",

        "wiki": "The Cantonal Botanical Museum and Gardens (French: Mus\u00e9e et jardins botaniques cantonaux, MJBC) in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, comprises the museum and botanical garden in Lausanne, as well as the botanical garden, La Thomasia, in the Alps near the town of Bex.\nAdministered under the Service of cultural affairs of Vaud, the museum and gardens engage in the study and protection of local flora, as well as in promoting public awareness in biodiversity and nature education in general.\nThe museum, as well as the two botanical gardens are listed as cultural assets of national importance.\n\n\n== The botanical garden in Lausanne ==\n\nAlthough the first recorded private botanical garden in Lausanne dates from the end of the seventeenth century, the first cantonal botanical garden had its origin in the donation by Baron Albert de B\u00fcren of his collection of 1700 plants to the state in 1873. This was to serve as the basis for the creation of a botanical garden by the canton. At first, there was a temporary placement at Champ-de-l 'Air near what is now the University Hospital of Lausanne. In 1890, the collection was moved to the site of the newly constituted University of Lausanne, below the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics, rue de Couvaloup, where it was essentially used for the teaching of pharmacy and visited mainly by students.In 1946, the garden was moved to its actual location, Avenue de Cour 14, on the south slope of Montriond-le-Cr\u00eat, a hill in the Parc de Milan, between the Lausanne train station and Lake L\u00e9man. \nThe design and creation of this new garden was the fruit of the close collaboration between the architect, Alphonse Laverri\u00e8re, the professor Florian Cosandey, and the gardener, Charles Lardet. The plan for this new site included alpine rock gardens and a pool dominated by a cliff made of strata of rock and a cascade falling into the basin. The stone came from the Jura Mountains above Bi\u00e8re but the quarrying and assembly were made more difficult than custom by the strict requirements of the job. No marks of tools or broken fragments were allowed to be seen in the finished work, which must appear natural and as if part of the original hill site.The garden today counts more than 6,000 plants, both local and from around the world, set in sectors dedicated to alpine, aquatic, medicinal and utilitarian plants, as well as greenhouses with tropical, succulent, and carnivorous specimens, and a small arboretum .\n\n\n== The alpine garden, La Thomasia ==\n\nLa Thomasia, is located near the town of Bex, Canton Vaud, in the calcareous Swiss Alps. In spite of the relative low altitude, 1260 meters, its situation at the entrance of the Vallon de Nant, a small glacier valley, induces a subalpine climate to the garden. The valley is managed as a nature reserve since 1970. \nLa Thomasia was created in 1891, by the initiative of the city of Bex, and is the oldest continuously active alpine garden of Switzerland. By 1895, under Ernest Wilczek, director of the botanical garden in Lausanne, the collection counted already some 2000 species.The garden takes its name from the family Thomas that gave four generations of botanists. The first was Pierre Thomas, who began his work under the direction of Albrecht von Haller, the author of the first flora of Switzerland. The family later made a business of collecting alpine plants in the mountains surrounding Bex and selling them to foreign collectors and gardens.\nThe garden is dedicated to alpine flora from all parts of the world. Over 3000 plant species are presented in the 70 rock gardens, covering over one hectare, and grouped according to geographical origin representing all the alpine and related regions of the world. The European Alps sector includes a large focus on local flora.The surface of the garden is basically flat but covered with small artificial hills, which allow cultivation on different exposures and in a variety of habitats. Several ponds as well as a stream have been created and on the Eastern part, there is a spontaneous forest of European Spruce with large rocks, ferns and mosses. \nAn ecological area dedicated to spontaneous fauna was recently created. It consists of a small oligotrophic lake for amphibians, as well as reconstituted habitats for insects and small mammals with dead trees and alpine fellfields.\nIn the nursery, plants are cultivated for the botanical garden or for experimental research.\nThe alpine garden is open daily from May through October, depending on snowfall and road conditions.\n\n\n== The botanical museum ==\nThe museum is the repository of botanical collections for the Canton of Vaud. Beginning as a dependence of the Natural History Museum in 1824, the herbarium collection was given a distinct curator, Louis-Edouard Chavannes, 20 years later. He was succeeded by Rodolphe Blanchet, Jean-Balthazar Schnetzler, Louis Favrat, Ernest Wilczek, Arthur Maillefer, Florian Cosandey, Peter Villaret and Gino M\u00fcller. The current director of the museum and the gardens is Fran\u00e7ois Felber.In 1860, the botanical museum became an independent entity. At first, the herbarium collection occupied one room at the cure Dutoit. In 1874, it was transferred to the \"Moravian House\", rue Saint-Etienne below the cathedral, and in 1905, to the newly constructed Palais de Rumine along with all of the natural history collections of the canton. The herbarium collection was finally given its own home in 1964 with the construction of the current museum in the botanical garden of Lausanne.\nToday the museum counts a herbarium collection of approximately one million herbarium sheets covering nearly 2,000 meters of shelving. The main collection is divided into three sections: 300,000 samples exclusively from the Canton of Vaud; 250,000 samples from other Swiss cantons; and a general herbarium collection of over 350,000 samples from the entire world. In addition to these the museum houses other historical herbarium collections including those of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gaudin (1766-1833) and Johann-Christoph Schleicher (1770-1834), as well as specialized collections of lichens, mosses, algae and fungi, myxomycetes (Myxogastria), and samples of seeds and pollen.\nAnother noteworthy collection of the botanical museum is that of botanical illustration, and in particular, painted herbariums (Herbiers peints), dating from the late 18th century to the present day. Works by botanical illustrators include those by Rosalie de Constant  (1758-1834), Marie Mousson (1805-1895), Mary Grierson (born 1912).\nThe museum also houses a collection of portraits of botanists and an archive which conserves essentially the correspondence and documents concerning notable botanists from the Canton of Vaud and the rest of Switzerland.The museum\u2019s library dates from the beginning of the museum in 1824. It currently contains approximately 35,000 books and over 800 periodicals of which 122 are still published. The collection covers all aspects of plant biology. Although it consists mainly of specialized works and focuses primarily on the acquisition of floras and monographs in systematic botany, books destined for the amateur can also found. The library conserves a collection of 3375 ancient books, floras and other works dating from 1531 to 1901, including works by Linn\u00e9, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, Albrecht von Haller, Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, Dominique Villars, Lamarck, Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, and others. The library is open to the public by appointment only.\n\n\n== Activities of the Cantonal museum and botanical gardens ==\nThe museum in its role of furthering public awareness and education in nature in general engages in various activities. Since 1994 and the creation of a multipurpose room, the Cantonal Museum and Botanical Gardens regularly mount botany-related exhibitions that often extend into the grounds of the two gardens, Lausanne and the alpine garden. Recent shows include: Diaspora, about fruit and seed dispersal; The painted herbarium of Rosalie de Constant; Au Rendez-vous des Arbres, photos of remarkable trees; and Wild flowers in the city.The Museum and Botanical Gardens cantonal also organize animations for young persons and the general public, as well as conferences and botanical excursions, with the assistance of local botany associations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nM.-C.

          "It is a place to observe the nature, and the breath taking view over the lake Geneva; changes can be observed from the chilly winter to the blossoming springs, a nice walk will bring you on top of the hill, and you will be enjoying many little paths to go down through the alpine",

          "Interetsting plants, but nothing was at its best and lots and lots o weeding would be needed to tidy it up - The Swiss seem to be good at tidy ormally. Great views but for the plants go earlier in the year than October",
          "It's a pleasant walk but not recommended if you have a stroller. To reach the top of the hill where you can enjoy a nice view of the lake you gotta take several steps and it's not practical at all with a stroller. Overall it's a nice botanical garden to spend a visit.",
          "It's not like a normal botanical garden as you've expect, meaning not to many flowers and floral ornaments, it's more like a park, with a spiral structure and when you get to the top, there is a nice view of the city. Nice place to spend some relaxing time",
          "We brought a picnic and had it on the grass, then walked around the gardens. There is a fountain and small pond on the grounds and some children were swimming, so the kids had a paddle. Lovely spot to spend a few hours and no charge. I don't know how impressed any major",

          "whilst this is not the most striking of botanical gardens, it is a perfectly pleasant walk up and down a grassy knoll, amongst the plants. it's also free, which considering the price of everything else in switzerland, will come as some respite! but the real joy is the view",
          "This park really surprised me, because i didn't expect this little hill which is the park. walking up the little hill you reach a lovely plateau with an outdoor scene. and on the \"hillside\" there are lovely flowers and trees. A sweet place in Lausanne",
          "Anywhere else in the world the charm and views of the botanic garden would pack them in. Here it's mostly empty and you have a marvelous garden to yourself. In a large park, free, and even has loads of benches, areas you can picnic in."

        "wiki": "Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Maire (Saint-Maire Castle) is a castle in Lausanne, Switzerland, that serves as the seat of the cantonal government, the Council of State of Vaud. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ch\u00e2teau was built from 1397 to 1425 by the Bishops of Lausanne to serve as their fortified residence. Begun under Guillaume of Menthonay, it was completed under his successor, Guillaume of Challant, and named after Saint Marius, the first Bishop of Lausanne. It served as the bishop's residence until 1536, when Bern captured Lausanne and secularized the bishopric (the bishop, S\u00e9bastien of Montfalcon, escaped through a hidden stairwell). The Bernese installed a bailiff in the ch\u00e2teau and used it as an armory. Upon the creation of the canton of Vaud in 1803, it became seat of the cantonal government, a role it has retained.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe ch\u00e2teau was built as a single massive rectangular block, as was common at the time, with brick for the upper portion and sandstone for the lower portion. It originally had Ghibelline merlons, which gave it a somewhat Italian appearance, but due to the wet climate, the roof was extended and the merlons filled, probably in the 16th century. The windows that form a row just below the eaves fill the gaps between the merlons, and the arches above the windows fill the v-shaped openings in the Ghibelline style of merlon.In 1789, the Bernese built an annex on the west side of the castle, through which it is now entered. A tower that formerly stood next to the ch\u00e2teau was demolished in 1890, and around the same time, a statue of Abraham Davel was installed against the front wall.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cultural property of national significance in Switzerland: Vaud\nList of castles and fortresses in Switzerland\nCouncil of State of Vaud\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPage on the website of the City of Lausanne",

        "wiki": "Le Flon is a district of the city of Lausanne, in Switzerland. It is served by Lausanne M\u00e9tro lines 1 and 2 from Lausanne-Flon station.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThis area is in the bowl of a valley that has been filled. A river, also named Flon, once flowed through this valley and now runs underground. The area is situated in the central neighborhood of Lausanne.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Flon was once a wooded and uninhabited valley. The early industrial development in the nineteenth century saw new mills, tanneries and fullers occupy the Flon valley, accompanied by a bad reputation due to the activity of leather work, which brought unpleasant smells, forcing Lausanne inhabitants to avoid the place.\nOn March 12, 1874, the Compagnie du Chemin de fer Lausanne-Ouchy (which later became the Group Lausanne-Ouchy SA) was founded to provide transport for people and goods between the port of Ouchy, the station of the then Jura-Simplon line, and the Place Saint-Fran\u00e7ois. The Company became the owner of the valley in exchange for supporting all the costs of the work that was planned and which began the following June.\nTunnels were dug between Lausanne and Ouchy, and the excavated soil was used to backfill the Flon, downstream of the Grand Pont (Great Bridge). This major undertaking lasted until the end of World War II, giving the area during 40 years the looks of a wasteland to what was a once green valley.\nIn the early twentieth century, the Flon had become the main freight station of the city of Lausanne. However, from 1950 the site was connected to the rest of the city that extended around the ancient valley, removing the reason to be of the Gare du Flon. A period started during which the site deteriorated and some warehouses were transformed into low rent offices. The nightclub MAD opened in the 1980s.\nIn 1991, Line 1 of the Lausanne Metro opened, with its central terminus located at Lausanne-Flon, to give interchange with the M\u00e9tro Lausanne\u2013Ouchy and LEB commuter trains to \u00c9challens and Bercher.\nUp until the early 1990s, The Flon was considered a bad area of Lausanne. The Group Lausanne-Ouchy SA decided to start major work in accordance with their Plan partiel d'affectation which was divided into two parts (Flon Flon vision 1 and vision 2). In June 1999 the Municipal Council adopted the Lausanne PPP. The extensive work helped rehabilitate Le Flon, particularly with the opening of a seven-screen cinema complex along with a parking lot (which was given an award in 2003 by the European Parking Association Association), an English pub and a Thai restaurant.\n\n\n== Notes et references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPage on the website of the City of Lausanne",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods. They are: Centre (1), Maupas/Valency (2), S\u00e9beillon/Malley (3), Montoie/Bourdonnette (4), Montriond/Cour (5), Sous-Gare/Ouchy (6), Montchoisi (7), Florimont/Chissiez (8), Mousquines/Bellevue (9), Vallon/B\u00e9thusy (10), Chailly/Rov\u00e9r\u00e9az (11), Sallaz/Vennes/S\u00e9chaud (12), Sauvabelin (13), Borde/Bellevaux (14), Vinet/Pontaise (15), Bossons/Bl\u00e9cherette (16), Beaulieu/Grey/Boisy (17), and Les Zones foraines (90)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe municipality (la Municipalit\u00e9) constitutes the executive government of the City of Lausanne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of seven councilors (French: conseiller municipal/conseill\u00e8re municipale), each presiding over a directorate. One of the members act as mayor (syndic). In the mandate period 2016\u20132021 (la l\u00e9gislature) the Municipality is presided by Monsieur le Syndic Gr\u00e9goire Junod. Directoral tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Communal Council are carried by the Municipality. The regular election of the Municipality by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every five years. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipality. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud. The current mandate period is from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is later on elected as such by a public election as well by a system of Majorz, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Town Hall (L'H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de la Palud.As of 2016, Lausanne's Municipality is made up of three representatives of the PS (Social Democratic Party, of whom one is also the mayor), and two members of PES (Green Party), and one each of le Parti Ouvrier et Populaire Vaudois (POP) & gauche en mouvement (an alliance of the left parties POP (Parti Suisse du Travail \u2013 Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidarit\u00e9S and ind\u00e9pendant.e.s), and PLR (Les Lib\u00e9raux-Radicaux (PLR)), giving the left parties a very strong six out of seven seats. The last election was held on 28 February/20 March 2016. The mayor was elected by two ballots on 17 April/8 May 2016.\n\nSimon Affolter is Town Chancellor (chancelier municipal) since for the Municipality.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Communal Council (Conseil communal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 100 members, with elections held every five years. The Communal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipality and the administration. The sessions of the Communal Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipality, members of the Communal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Communal Council. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud. The Parliament holds its meetings in the Town Hall (H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de la Palud.The last election of the Communal Council was held on 28 February 2016 for the mandate period (la l\u00e9gislature) from 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2021.

It is a government-supported institution founded in 1985 by Charles-Henri Favrod in an 18th-century mansion.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe collection of more than 100,000 photographs includes those of colour pioneer Gabriel Lippmann right up to contemporary photographers such as Jeff Wall. The museum offers both collection and temporary exhibitions.\nThe entire collections of Ella Maillart and Nicolas Bouvier have been left to the museum after their deaths. In 2011 the museum acquired Charlie Chaplin's entire collection of photographs: around 10,000 photographs taken throughout Chaplin's career.\nAs of 2015, the Director is Tatyana Franck.  It is planned that the collection will move into a new building in 2020, in a complex currently under construction, designed by Portuguese architects Aires Mateus, and combining it with two other museums: the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts, the latter also by Aires Mateus.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2016: Lucie Award in Spotlight Award category\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nYouTube Mus\u00e9e de l'Elys\u00e9e short video tour",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods.

        "wiki": "The Lausanne M\u00e9tro (French: M\u00e9tro de Lausanne) system is a two-line urban rail transport system in Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland. Around a quarter of the system has been used for urban rail transport since 1877, when the route between the city centre and Ouchy opened as Switzerland's first public funicular railway. The network is owned by two distinct companies and operated by a third.\nOf the operating lines, only Line M2 can be considered a true, grade-separated rapid transit line (Line M1 is considered light rail albeit being underground for a short section). It is a fully automated, rubber-tyred metro line based on the technology of the Paris M\u00e9tro and opened on 27 October 2008. This makes Lausanne the first (and as of 2019, the only) city in Switzerland to have a full metro system; Z\u00fcrich once proposed a U-Bahn system in the 1960s and 1970s, which failed in the face of massive political and public opposition, though Z\u00fcrich does have sections of its S-Bahn network that see frequencies comparable to metro services.\nUpon the opening of Line M2, Lausanne replaced Rennes, France as the smallest city in the world to have a full metro system. A third line (Line M3) is now planned, based on the same rubber-tyred metro technology as Line M2.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Lausanne-Ouchy railway, the precursor to the M2 Line of the Lausanne M\u00e9tro, was inaugurated in 1877 as a funicular. In 1959 the first overhaul took place by transforming the funicular into a rack railway under the name \"m\u00e9tro\". At that time, Flon and Gare CFF stations were demolished and replaced by concrete underground equivalents. The line was however always nicknamed La Ficelle (literal translation: \"The String\") by its users due to its funicular past and circulation above ground in the greenery for more than half of its run.\nConnected to the Flon facilities, the freight trains from the main station to the storage area of the harbour (in Flon) travelled on this line until the construction of a direct connection between the freight station of S\u00e9beillon and the Flon Valley in 1954.\nThe line was finally closed to all traffic on 21 January 2006. The rolling stock was originally sold to the French city of Villard-de-Lans which planned the construction in 2008 of its own rack railway, La Patache, to ensure a link between the centre of Villard and Le Balcon de Villard.\nA bus service was put into operation to replace the then-closed \"La Ficelle\" until the opening of the new metro M2 Line. This service was called M\u00e9trobus (MB): the south loop linked Ouchy to the CFF station and the north loop linked the station to Montbenon (which is located right above the Flon area).\n\n\n== Current service ==\n\n\n=== Line M1 ===\n\n\n=== Line M2 ===\n\nThe Lausanne M\u00e9tro Line M2 is 5.9-kilometre (3.7 mi) long and uses the alignment of the former Lausanne-Ouchy railway, plus a new route towards Epalinges, crossing the whole city of Lausanne from north to south. Construction work (including enabling works) took around 4 years, and brought significant rebuilds of all former M\u00e9tro Lausanne-Ouchy stations, plus involved moving the platforms at Lausanne-Flon station a short distance further north to give Cross-platform interchange from northbound M2 to the Lausanne-Echallens-Bercher railway. The new line opened in autumn 2008.\n\n\n==== Technical ====\nThe line is not entirely underground, but the majority (70-90%) of the system is in tunnel. The line is steeply sloped, with an average incline of 5.7% and as steep as 12% in some places. A rubber-tyred metro was selected to counter these, the steepest slopes of any similar adhesion-worked system in the world. The constraints in braking distance and deceleration are such that the M2 can travel faster upwards than downwards.\n\nThe regular passenger route is 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) in length from Ouchy to Epalinges, including 1.5 km (0.93 mi) of line that replaces the former Lausanne-Ouchy railway. There are 14 stations on the line, which makes a  338 m (1,109 ft) vertical gain. An additional 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) of track is contained within the depot at Vennes, along with the signalling, security and information facilities.The line is entirely automated, managed from a central command station. This means that it is cheaper to operate than a traditional system with drivers, and more flexible during peak hours. The stations are equipped with platform screen doors and dedicated station personnel are on hand to assist passengers. In contrast with line 1, trains also run on a totally separate right-of-way, meaning there is no conflict between the surface traffic and the metro, enhancing safety and reliability compared to a tramway. All new sections of the route were built as double track, plus the reused Lausanne-Ouchy alignment was also rebuilt as double-track, with the exception of the tunnel under the CFF station due to high costs. This leads to increased capacity and less potential for knock-on delays.\n\n\n===== Performance =====\nThe line opened in 2008 with a designed capacity of 25 million passengers/year, but exceeded this with 27.6 million by 2013, and 28 million in 2014. As of February 2015, overcrowding is now a significant problem, and the state has granted significant funds towards a programme which will improve capacity by running extra trains and building additional tracks. Patronage has continued to rise, with 31.5 million passengers carried in 2018.Trains travel up to every 3 minutes between the main railway station and La Sallaz, with trains every 6 minutes along the rest of the line. The trains travel with a top service speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) top speed, taking 18 minutes to travel the full length of the line. The line was designed for up to 6,600 passengers/hour in each direction.\n\n\n==== Stations ====\nThe underground stations are located as close as possible to the surface. They are equipped with stairs, lifts and facilities for handicapped people. The Lausanne slopes have been used to create multi-level access, make ramp access easier and take advantage of natural light as much as possible.\n\n\n==== Rolling stock ====\n\nArticulated vehicles with 4 powered bogies.\n15 two-car trainsets.\n222 passengers, 62 seated.\nRubber-tyred metro with lateral guidance based on the MP 89 from Paris M\u00e9tro.\nFully automated (Meteor).\n\n\n===== Technical data of the trains =====\nLength of a train : 30,680 mm (100 ft 7.9 in)\nLength of a car : 15,340 mm (50 ft 3.9 in)\nWidth of a car : 2,450 mm (8 ft 0.46 in)\nHeight of the car to ground level: 3,470 mm (11 ft 4.61 in)\nMass of an empty train : 57,316 kg (126,360 lb)\nMass of a train at maximum load (4 p/m\u00b2) : 72,856 kg (160,620 lb) (\u00b9)\nWidth of the access doors : 1,650 mm (5 ft 4.96 in)\nHeight of the access doors : 1,900 mm (6 ft 2.80 in)(\u00b9) Calculated with an average of 70 kg (154 lb) per passenger.\n\n\n===== Capacity of the trains =====\n\n\n===== Delivery of the trains =====\nThe first train was delivered to Lausanne on 2 March 2006 and all the other trains were delivered at a rate of two per month. When they arrived, the trains were stored in the CFF storage of Lausanne. Once the m\u00e9tro's depot had been completed, the vehicles were moved to the Vennes facility by the Autumn of 2006.\nWith the line having been over its design capacity for at least 2 years, the state granted funds for 3 additional metro trainsets in February 2015. The vehicles are being built in Valenciennes by Alstom, who also built the original fleet, and are designed to be identical to the existing rolling stock. The new vehicles, which are due to arrive in Lausanne by mid-2017, are an interim solution to raise capacity on the central section of the line. Capacity between Lausanne-gare and Sallaz stations will rise from 5,600 passengers per hour (each way) to 7,000 passengers per hour (each way) when they enter service in the last 3 months of 2017. The longer-term plan, for which funding is now also in place, involves a new double-track tunnel under the railway station.\n\n\n==== Accidents ====\nOn 23 February 2005, part of the tunnel under construction collapsed under the Saint-Laurent square in the centre of Lausanne. More than 500 m\u00b3 of debris (water and earth) fell into the tunnel, forming a huge fifteen metre gap. The area was completely evacuated for a few days and consolidation and geological analysis work started. A large pocket of water had not been noticed during the initial explorations.\nRepair work lasted for a few months. The incident fortunately had no major consequence; nobody was in the area of the collapse which had heavily damaged a shopping mall. Part of the budget had been allocated for such risks and the deadline for the construction in December 2008 was not directly affected.\nOn 27 October 2006, a construction worker died from injuries. He had fallen a few days before on the construction site at the level of the entrance of the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV).\nOn 28 July 2008 a high level manager for Alstom who had responsibility for the security system for the new lines was found hanging in the stairwell at the entrance to the Vennes station of the M2. The 45-year-old French man's death appeared to have been a suicide.\n\n\n==== Extensions and development ====\n\n\n===== New Lausanne-Gare section =====\nThe state has granted funds for major development of the M\u00e9tro system, with plans in place for improvement work until 2025. Development on the M2 line will also provide for the future of a line 3. Capacity improvement is currently limited to the central and northern sections of the line, because the tunnel under the main railway station is only single-track. Funding is now in place to build a new double-track tunnel under the railway station, and relocate the m\u00e9tro station closer to the main-line platforms. This will mean extra capacity is available on the whole line, and will leave the original tunnel and 2006 station available for the planned line 3. As of October 2019, a further public scrutiny project is underway, and work to build the new tunnel and platforms is due to start in 2022, with the new route expected to be operational in 2027.\n\n\n===== Northward extension =====\nThe end station Les Croisettes has been designed to allow a future extension of the line to the north towards Epalinges-Village, or even Le Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet.\n\n\n== Future service ==\n\n\n=== Line M3 ===\nA Line M3 is proposed to serve the new development area of La Bl\u00e9cherette and the west of Lausanne (Malley, Renens Bussigny). Line M3 is planned to use metro technology compatible with the M2 and would be in correspondence with M1, M2 and LEB railway at the station Lausanne-Flon. The press theorised that the M3 could take over the M2 line from Ouchy to Lausanne Gare and a new terminus for the M2 would be established. However, this issue has subsequently been clarified: while new platforms will be built at Lausanne Gare, a second tunnel will be constructed from there to Grancy, underneath the main railway station. Under these proposals, both lines 2 and 3 will share the physical track onwards to Ouchy. This additional tunnel would bring the immediate benefit of allowing more frequent m\u00e9tro services to the railway station. The proposals were put to a referendum in February 2014, and having won public approval in the vote, work on the new line was projected to start in 2018, and a managerial position for the project has been advertised.In 2014, it was reported that the first stage of construction would be between Lausanne-Chauderon station, Lausanne-Gare and Ouchy, as a total of 47 million francs have been given to the project by the Federal Council.  It is expected the second phase of work, between Chauderon and La Bl\u00e9cherette, will cost a further 72 million francs. Public inquiries into the first construction project have now opened, covering the initial stretch to reroute line 2 between Grancy and the current Lausanne-Gare platforms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM\u00e9tro Lausanne\u2013Ouchy\nLausanne Modern Tram\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTransports Lausannois (TL) (in French)\nLausanne Metro at UrbanRail.net (in English)\nLausanne M\u00e9tro at public-transport.net (in English)\nLausanne Metro Map at metrolinemap.com (in English)\nUne petite recherche sur la compagnie du Lausanne-Ouchy et la gare de S\u00e9beillon, par Julien Sansonnens (in French)\nLO - M\u00e9tro Lausanne-Ouchy (Photos) (in French)\ngalerie Photos-Trains.ch (photos) (in French)",

          "Nice city museum featuring a limited number of famous artists and lots of regional landscapes and portraits. Worth a visit, especially when paired with one of the other three museums that share a common ticket for admission.",
          "On a Sunday morning we saw the video art exposition, well-documented and, to use that horrible but ineluctable word, \"interesting.\" Pipilotti Rist's was most interesting. And we in fact really enjoyed the rest of the museum, the geology and archeology depts. Should be seen once.",
          "We visited the exhibition Valloton-Katz. Very nice as both artists really do match in a way. Unfortunately in my opinion: the museum owns close to 10'000 paintings according to their webpage but has no space to show even the masterpieces. Hopefully the new building will change",
          "We found there any interesting collections. The part dedicated to contemporary glass work was really beautiful. In the museum you will find also many artifacts of middle age and well presented. We spent more than 1 hour inside and I think I will come back with my kids during",
          "Although not on a level with Paris or London, there are a number of pieces in this museum worth seeing, and it is definitely worth the entrance fee. The highlight of the collection is the Swiss art, ranging from the mountain landscapes of Louis Ducros and others, to more modern,"

          "Stunning habitat of contemporary and modern art - the whole place is amazing. If you are in the area, you must absolutely go. If you are looking for a reason to visit the area - this is it! If you're asking if it is worth visiting just for going to Platform 10 - it is!",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods.

          "The good thing with this \"museum\" (it is way too small to be called a museum) is that it promotes science by allowing the visitors to interact. This is always good and very appreciated by kids whose short attention span is kept by all the touching they are allowed to do. I",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods. They are: Centre (1), Maupas/Valency (2), S\u00e9beillon/Malley (3), Montoie/Bourdonnette (4), Montriond/Cour (5), Sous-Gare/Ouchy (6), Montchoisi (7), Florimont/Chissiez (8), Mousquines/Bellevue (9), Vallon/B\u00e9thusy (10), Chailly/Rov\u00e9r\u00e9az (11), Sallaz/Vennes/S\u00e9chaud (12), Sauvabelin (13), Borde/Bellevaux (14), Vinet/Pontaise (15), Bossons/Bl\u00e9cherette (16), Beaulieu/Grey/Boisy (17), and Les Zones foraines (90)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe municipality (la Municipalit\u00e9) constitutes the executive government of the City of Lausanne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of seven councilors (French: conseiller municipal/conseill\u00e8re municipale), each presiding over a directorate. One of the members act as mayor (syndic). In the mandate period 2016\u20132021 (la l\u00e9gislature) the Municipality is presided by Monsieur le Syndic Gr\u00e9goire Junod. Directoral tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Communal Council are carried by the Municipality. The regular election of the Municipality by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every five years. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipality. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud. The current mandate period is from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is later on elected as such by a public election as well by a system of Majorz, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Town Hall (L'H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de la Palud.As of 2016, Lausanne's Municipality is made up of three representatives of the PS (Social Democratic Party, of whom one is also the mayor), and two members of PES (Green Party), and one each of le Parti Ouvrier et Populaire Vaudois (POP) & gauche en mouvement (an alliance of the left parties POP (Parti Suisse du Travail \u2013 Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidarit\u00e9S and ind\u00e9pendant.e.s), and PLR (Les Lib\u00e9raux-Radicaux (PLR)), giving the left parties a very strong six out of seven seats. The last election was held on 28 February/20 March 2016. The mayor was elected by two ballots on 17 April/8 May 2016.\n\nSimon Affolter is Town Chancellor (chancelier municipal) since for the Municipality.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe Communal Council (Conseil communal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 100 members, with elections held every five years. The Communal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipality and the administration. The sessions of the Communal Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipality, members of the Communal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Communal Council. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud.

        "wiki": "Chillon Castle (French: Ch\u00e2teau de Chillon) is an island castle located on Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man), south of Veytaux in the canton of Vaud. It is situated at the eastern end of the lake, on the narrow shore between Montreux and Villeneuve, which gives access to the Alpine valley of the Rh\u00f4ne. Chillon is amongst the most visited castles in Switzerland and Europe. Successively occupied by the house of Savoy then by the Bernese from 1536 until 1798, it now belongs to the State of Vaud and is classified as a Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance. The Fort de Chillon, its modern counterpart, is hidden in the steep side of the mountain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChillon began as a Roman outpost, guarding the strategic road through the Alpine passes.\nThe later history of Chillon was influenced by three major periods: the Savoy Period, the Bernese Period, and the Vaudois Period.The castle of Chillon is built on the island of Chillon, an oval limestone rock advancing in Lake Geneva between Montreux and Villeneuve with a steep side on one side and on the other side the lake and its steep bottom. The placement of the castle is strategic: it closes the passage between the Vaud Riviera (access to the north towards Germany and France) and the Rhone valley which allows quick access to Italy. Moreover, the place offers an excellent point of view on the Savoyard coast facing. A garrison could thus control (both militarily and commercially) access to the road to Italy and apply a toll. According to the Swiss ethnologist Albert Samuel Gatschet, the name Chillon comes from Waldensian dialect and would mean \"flat stone, slab, platform\". Castrum Quilonis (1195) would therefore mean \"castle built on a chillon,\" that is to say on a rock platform.The first construction dates back to around the 10th century, although it is likely that it was already a privileged military site before that date. Objects dating back to Roman times were discovered during excavations in the 19th century, as well as remains from the Bronze Age. From a double wooden palisade, the Romans would have fortified the site before a square dungeon was added in the 10th century. Sources from the 13th century link the possession of the Chillon site to the Bishop of Sion.\nA charter of 1150, where Count Humbert III grants the Cistercians of Hautcr\u00eat free passage to Chillon, attests to the domination of the House of Savoy on Chillon. The owner of the castle is mentioned as Gaucher de Blonay, a vassal of the Count of Savoy. At the time it was a seigniorial domination of the Savoy within the framework of a feudal society and not an administrative domination.\n\n\n=== Savoy period ===\n\nThe oldest parts of the castle have not been definitively dated, but the first written record of the castle was in 1005. It was built to control the road from Burgundy to the Great Saint Bernard Pass. From the mid 12th century, the castle was summer home to the Counts of Savoy, who kept a fleet of ships on Lake Geneva. The castle was greatly expanded in 1248 and 1266-7 by Peter II. During this time the distinctive windows were added that would later be added to Harlech Castle by Master James of Saint George.\n\n\n=== Chillon as a prison ===\nDuring the 16th century Wars of Religion, it was used by the dukes of Savoy to house prisoners. Its most famous prisoner was probably Fran\u00e7ois de Bonivard, a Genevois monk, prior of St. Victor in Geneva and politician who was imprisoned there in 1530 for defending his homeland from the dukes of Savoy. Over his six-year term, de Bonivard paced as far as his chain would allow, and the chain and rut are still visible.\n\n\n=== Bernese period ===\nIn 1536 the castle was captured by a Genevois and Bernese force. All the prisoners, including de Bonivard, were released. The castle became the residence for the Bernese bailiff until Chillon was converted into a state prison in 1733.\n\n\n=== Vaudois period ===\nIn 1798, the French-speaking canton of Vaud drove out the German-speaking Bernese authorities and declared the Lemanic Republic. The Vaudois invited in French troops to help them maintain autonomy from the other Swiss. When the French moved in and occupied, Chillon was used as a munitions and weapons depot.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nAt the end of the 19th century, structures were set up for a scientific restoration of the monument. This systematic undertaking, a true laboratory where an ethic of monumental restoration is developed, was considered quite exemplary. It was boasted in particular by Johann Rudolf Rahn in a lecture given in 1898 to the Zurich Antiquity Society, and the German Emperor himself, William II, inquired about the Chillon model in view of the reconstruction of the fortress of Haut-Koenigsbourg.This result is due to the conjunction of several factors:\n\nthe emergence of particularly competent personalities;\nthe creation of the Association for the restoration of Chillon;\nthe appointment of a Technical Commission to guide the work;\nthe adoption by the Canton of Vaud of the 1898 law on historic monuments.The reconstruction of Chillon was one of the first times that the sciences of archaeology and history were applied to rebuild a structure in an historically accurate way.\nThe intervention of pioneering personalities in the protection of monuments is decisive. In particular: Johann Rudolf Rahn, one of the main protagonists at the origin of the Swiss Society of Historical Monuments in 1880, and Henry de Geym\u00fcller, international specialist of the monumental restoration, closely associated with the rehabilitation of buildings such as the Romanesque church of Church of Saint-Sulpice, Vaud in Saint-Sulpice, the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois church in Lausanne, and the Lausanne Cathedral. In addition, Ernest Burnat, who was also very involved in Lausanne Cathedral, was initially named architect of this restoration and was replaced by Albert Naef, who played a major role in the development of archaeology in the canton of Vaud and devoted twenty years of his life to the study of Chillon.The Association for the restoration of the castle of Chillon was constituted in 1887. From the outset, it aimed for an \"artistic\" restoration with the intention of \"giving back to objects the character with which they were clothed, almost a latent life, a life impression of the ideas of their time\". It is also planned to create a historical museum at the castle.A technical commission, ratified in 1889, was composed of renowned art historians and architects, specialized in the monumental restoration: Johann Rudolf Rahn, Th\u00e9odore Fivel, architect in Chamb\u00e9ry and great connoisseur of Savoyard castrale architecture, L\u00e9o Chatelain, restorer of the Collegiate Church of Neuch\u00e2tel, Henry de Geym\u00fcller, theoretician of the restoration and specialist of the Renaissance architecture, finally Henri Assinare, architect of the State. Their first meeting took place on October 27, 1890 and from then on these specialists, for many years, closely supervised the work. Geym\u00fcller, in particular, relying on principles already published in 1865 (and augmented in 1888) by the Royal Institute of British Architects, set a framework by writing a memoir entitled Milestones for the Restoration Program and Fundamental Principles on which it was to be based (printed in Lausanne in 1896).The Waldensian law of 1898 \u2013 the first of its kind in Switzerland \u2013 was drafted by Albert Naef. In particular, it planned to establish a cantonal commission for historic monuments and to create a cantonal archeologist's post. Naef, of course, was appointed to this function and was responsible for putting in place a real protection of historical monuments.The systematic investigation of the castle was begun by Ernest Burnat, who initiated a general survey of the fortress, then continued and intensified by Albert Naef. The latter not only joined the Technical Commission at the death of Fivel in 1895, but replaced Burnat himself as architect-archaeologist in charge of the work. In his approach, aesthetics always remained subordinate to scientific ethics. The restoration had to be based on as much knowledge of the monument as possible and the investigation was methodical. It took into account the achievements of history through extensive research in the archives, it carried out archaeological excavations and detailed records, if necessary even to casts. The castle was literally laid bare, the whole process being conscientiously documented by plans, sketches and photographs, as well as by a minute newspaper that Naef kept from day to day. During the restoration, the replacement stones were duly indicated as such, by an inscription on the cut stone (R = Restored, RFS = Restoration facsimile, RL = Free Restoration), or by a change of color, or even a red line, on the masonry. This rule was truly respected until 1908, then was forgotten.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nSince the end of the 18th century, the castle has attracted romantic writers. From Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Victor Hugo via Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert and Lord Byron, the castle has inspired poets from around the world. Hugo says \"Chillon is a block of towers on a block of rocks.\" Some restorations, inspired by the romantic vision of aesthetics, were at the expense of historical veracity. In 1900, the architect Albert Naef continued the restoration work to reach the current state of the building. He remade the interior and the tapestries of certain rooms such as the great room of the bailiff, also called the \"great Bernese cuisine.\"\nBy 1939, the castle was hosting over 100,000 visitors a year. The proximity to the popular city of Montreux has not been unrelated to this craze. Success continues to grow over the years and by 2005 the monument now had about 300,000 visits per year. Thanks to the restorations, the castle is in excellent condition and gives a good model of the feudal architecture.\nThe castle has twice hosted the Compagnie du Graal theater company based in Thonon-les-Bains, to play a sound and light adaptation of King Lear by Shakespeare in 2009 and in 2012 an epic fresco inspired by Ancient Greece : Hyperion.\n\n\n== Art ==\nA mechanical automaton representing the Chillon Castle, 100 cm \u00d7 67 cm \u00d7 42 cm (39 in \u00d7 26 in \u00d7 17 in), 1/100 scale, made of zinc, steel and brass, equipped with a music box with the handwritten original sheet music by the Genevan composer E. Perrin, illustrates the capture of the castle and the liberation of Fran\u00e7ois Bonivard by the Bernese in 1536. Dating from 1890 and made during a period of five years by the watchmaker Edouard- GabrielWuthrich, the automaton maneuvers a hundred figurines, including many small soldiers. Barred windows also show the interior of the castle, including scenes of torture in prisons. After having disappeared for decades and being found in various homes, the automaton was eventually acquired by the Association of Friends of Chillon, the Cantonal Museum of Archeology and History (MCAH) and the Castle Foundation, for 59,000 Swiss francs, at an auction held in Paris in March 2016.Having been inspired by the story of Fran\u00e7ois Bonivard after a visit to the castle, Lord Byron wrote a poem on The Prisoner of Chillon in 1816.\nGustave Courbet painted the castle several times during his Swiss exile not far from there, in La Tour-de-Peilz. The most famous representation is \"The Castle of Chillon,\" oil on canvas painted in 1874 and currently located at the Mus\u00e9e Courbet in Ornans. The painter E. Lapierre (19th-20th century) also made an oil painting of the castle on canvas in 1896.\nIn his novel \"Daisy Miller\" of 1878, Henry James stages Chillon Castle as a place of visit for his heroine and his young American compatriot Winterbourne. What was the prison of Fran\u00e7ois Bonivard thus takes, from the beginning of the news, a symbolic and premonitory meaning of the destiny of Daisy Miller who thinks he can escape the shackles of social conventions.\n\n\n== Today ==\nChillon is open to the public for visits and tours. According to the castle website, Chillon is listed as \"Switzerland's most visited historic monument\". There is a fee for entrance and there are both parking spaces and a bus stop nearby for travel. Inside the castle there are several recreations of the interiors of some of the main rooms including the grand bedroom, hall, and cave stores. Inside the castle itself there are four great halls, three courtyards, and a series of bedrooms open to the public. One of the oldest is the Camera domini, which was a room occupied by the Duke of Savoy \u2013 it is decorated with 14th century medieval murals.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nChillon is the setting of Lord Byron's poem The Prisoner Of Chillon (1816) about Fran\u00e7ois de Bonivard. Byron also carved his name on a pillar of the dungeon.\nThe castle is one of the settings in Henry James's novella Daisy Miller (1878).\nChillon inspired the castle in the Disney animated film The Little Mermaid.\nThe castle was used as the cover image of Bill Evans' 1968 live album Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFort de Chillon \u2013 a 20th-century fort largely buried in the adjoining hillside\nList of castles in Switzerland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCox, Eugene L.

          "This imposing castle sat on a rocky outcrop on Lake Geneva is one of the best medieval castle you can visit. It\u2019s been restored extremely well but also has certain parts that have been left as they were so you can see the date and age of it. We have been twice, 10 years apart",

        "wiki": "Lake Geneva (French: lac L\u00e9man [lak lem\u0251\u0303] or le L\u00e9man [l\u0259 lem\u0251\u0303], rarely lac de Gen\u00e8ve [lak d\u0259 \u0292(\u0259)n\u025bv]; German: Genfersee [\u02c8\u0261\u025bnf\u0259r\u02ccze\u02d0]) is a lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France. It is one of the largest lakes in Western Europe and the largest on the course of the Rh\u00f4ne. Of it 59.53% (345.31 km2 or 133.32 sq mi) comes under the jurisdiction of Switzerland (cantons of Vaud, Geneva, and Valais), and 40.47% (234.71 km2 or 90.62 sq mi) under France (department of Haute-Savoie).\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe first recorded name of the lake is Lacus Lemannus, dating from Roman times; Lemannus comes from Ancient Greek Lim\u00e9nos L\u00edmn\u0113 (\u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7) meaning \"port's lake\"; it became Lacus Lausonius, although this name was also used for a town or district on the lake, Lacus Losanetes, and then the Lac de Lausanne in the Middle Ages. Following the rise of Geneva it became Lac de Gen\u00e8ve (translated into English as Lake of Geneva), but Lac L\u00e9man was the common name on all local maps and is the customary name in the French language. In contemporary English, the name Lake Geneva has become predominant.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLake Geneva is divided into three parts because of its different types of formation (sedimentation, tectonic folding, glacial erosion):\nHaut Lac (Upper Lake), the eastern part from the Rh\u00f4ne estuary to the line of Meillerie\u2013Rivaz\nGrand Lac (Large Lake), the largest and deepest basin with the lake's largest width\nPetit Lac (Small Lake), the most south-west, narrower and less deep part from Yvoire\u2013Promenthoux next Prangins to the exit in GenevaAccording to the Swiss Federal Office of Topography, Swisstopo, Lac de Gen\u00e8ve designates that part of the Petit Lac, which lies within the cantonal borders of Geneva (excluding the cantonal exclave C\u00e9ligny), so about from Versoix\u2013Hermance to the Rh\u00f4ne outflow in Geneva.\n\nThe Chablais Alps border is its southern shore, the western Bernese Alps lie over its eastern side. The high summits of Grand Combin and Mont Blanc are visible from some places. Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Navigation sur le lac L\u00e9man (CGN) operates boats on the lake.\nThe lake lies on the course of the Rh\u00f4ne. The river has its source at the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier near the Grimsel Pass to the east of the lake and flows down through the canton of Valais, entering the lake between Villeneuve and Le Bouveret, before flowing slowly towards its egress at Geneva. Other tributaries are La Dranse, L'Aubonne, La Morges, La Venoge, La Vuach\u00e8re, and La Veveyse.\n\nLake Geneva is the largest body of water in Switzerland, and greatly exceeds in size all others that are connected with the main valleys of the Alps. It is in the shape of a crescent, with the horns pointing south, the northern shore being 95 km (59 mi), the southern shore 72 km (45 mi) in length. The crescent form was more regular in a recent geological period, when the lake extended to Bex, about 18 km (11 mi) south of Villeneuve. The detritus of the Rh\u00f4ne has filled up this portion of the bed of the lake, and it appears that within the historical period the waters extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) beyond the present eastern margin of the lake. The greatest depth of the lake, in the broad portion between \u00c9vian-les-Bains and Lausanne, where it is just 13 km (8.1 mi) in width, has been measured as 310 m (1,020 ft), putting the bottom of the lake at 62 m (203 ft) above sea level. The lake's surface is the lowest point of the cantons of Valais and Vaud. The culminating point of the lake's drainage basin is Monte Rosa at 4,634 metres above sea level.\n\nThe beauty of the shores of the lake and of the sites of many of the places near its banks has long been celebrated. However, it is only from the eastern end of the lake, between Vevey and Villeneuve, that the scenery assumes an Alpine character. On the south side the mountains of Savoy and Valais are for the most part rugged and sombre, while those of the northern shore fall in gentle vine-covered slopes, thickly set with villages and castles.The snowy peaks of the Mont Blanc are shut out from the western end of the lake by the Voirons mountain, and from its eastern end by the bolder summits of the Grammont, Cornettes de Bise and Dent d'Oche, but are seen from Geneva, and between Nyon and Morges. From Vevey to Bex, where the lake originally extended, the shores are enclosed by comparatively high and bold mountains, and the vista terminates in the grand portal of the defile of St. Maurice, cleft to a depth of nearly 2,700 m (8,900 ft) between the opposite peaks of the Dents du Midi and the Dent de Morcles.The shore between Nyon and Lausanne is called La C\u00f4te because it is flatter. Between Lausanne and Vevey it is called Lavaux and is famous for its hilly vineyards.The average surface elevation of 372 m (1,220 ft) above sea level is controlled by the Seujet Dam in Geneva.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDue to climate change, the average temperature of deep water (more than 300 metres or 980 feet deep) increased from 4.4 \u00b0C (39.9 \u00b0F) in 1963 to 5.5 \u00b0C (41.9 \u00b0F) in 2016 (an increase of 1.1 \u00b0C or 2.0 \u00b0F in 53 years), while the average temperature of surface water (five metres or 16 feet deep) increased from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in 1970 to 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F) in 2016 (up 2 \u00b0C or 3.6 \u00b0F in 46 years).\n\n\n=== Bise ===\nLake Geneva (and particularly the lakeside parts of the city of Geneva) can be affected by the cold Bise, a northeasterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter. The strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the difference in air pressure between Geneva and G\u00fcttingen in canton of Thurgau. The Bise arises when the air pressure in G\u00fcttingen is higher than in Geneva.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nIn 563, according to the writings of Gregory of Tours and Marius Aventicensis, a tsunami wave swept along the lake, destroying the fort of Tauredunum and other settlements, and causing numerous deaths in Geneva. Simulations indicate that the Tauredunum event was most likely caused by a massive landslide near the Rh\u00f4ne delta, which caused a wave eight metres (26 ft) high to reach  within 70 minutes. In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy, and, with it, was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire in 1033.\nIn the late 1960s, pollution made it dangerous to swim at some beaches of the lake; indeed, visibility under water was near zero. By the 1980s, intense environmental pollution (eutrophication) had almost wiped out all the fish. Today, pollution levels have been dramatically cut back, and it is again considered safe to swim in the lake. Major leisure activities practiced include sailing, wind surfing, boating (including water skiing and wake-boarding), rowing, scuba diving and bathing.\nA total of four submarines have plied the depths of Lake Geneva.\nIn 1964, Jacques Piccard launched a tourist-oriented submarine, the Auguste Piccard (named for his explorer father), for the Swiss National Exhibition, meant to honor the Expo 64 theme of accomplishments by Swiss engineers and industry. After operating through to 1965 in Lake Geneva, Piccard used the vessel for scientific exploration in other parts of the world. Piccard later built the F.-A. Forel, launched in Lake Geneva in 1978 and used primarily for scientific research until it was retired in 2005. In 2011, in a collaborative operation led by \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, two Mir submersibles were used for ten weeks to conduct extensive scientific research in Lake Geneva.On a scientific footnote, in 1827, Lake Geneva was the site for the first measurement of the speed of sound in (fresh) water.  French mathematician Jacques Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm and Swiss physicist Daniel Collodon used two moored boats, separated by a measured distance, as the transmit and receive platforms for the sounds of exploding gunpowder.  The loud airborne sound coupled into the lake, establishing a loud underwater sound that could be measured at a distance.  The flash of the exploding gunpowder provided the visual starting cue for the timepiece, and the underwater explosion sound striking a bell provided the finish cue.\nThe lake is rich in wildlife, especially birds: both the common buzzard and the red kite  breed  here in considerable numbers.\n\n\n== Sport events ==\nYacht racing is a popular sport, and high-performance catamarans have been developed specifically for the lake.  The design of the Alinghi 5, the defender of the 2010 America's Cup, was influenced by those racing catamarans.  The best-known event, the \"Bol d'Or\" (not to be confused with other events having the same name) runs from Geneva to the end of the lake and back.The Tour du Lac rowing event also takes place on Lake Geneva. Competitors row once around the entire lake, making this 160-kilometre (99 mi) event the longest non-stop rowing regatta in the world.\nSeveral competitions for swimmers are organised yearly like the crossing of the lake from Lausanne to Evian (13km), from Chillon Castle to Geneva (70km),  from Montreux to Clarens (1.8 km), in Geneva (1.8 km), all in summer, and the Coupe de No\u00ebl, 125m in Geneva in December.\n\n\n== Towns and villages ==\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nEdmund Ludlow, famous as one who had signed the death warrant of English King Charles I, was granted on 16 April 1662 protection in and continued to live at Vevey until his death in 1692.Mary and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron holidayed by the lake and wrote ghost stories, one of which became the basis for the novel Frankenstein. The Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sisi) was stabbed to death on the quayside in Geneva in September 1898. Vladimir Lenin rented a little \"chalet\" at the French bank, near Geneva. Actor Charlie Chaplin spent his final years and died in Vevey (there is a memorial statue of him along the promenade; his home at Corsier-sur-Vevey is now a museum of his life and career). Actors No\u00ebl Coward, James Mason, Sir Peter Ustinov, Richard Burton and Audrey Hepburn all lived in villages on the shores of or in view of the lake.  David Bowie moved to a chalet to the north of Lake Geneva in 1976, which inspired him to take up painting and informed the first stages of the \"Berlin Trilogy\". Pop singer Phil Collins lives in a home overlooking the lake.  Rock band Queen owned and operated Mountain Recording Studios (which is still in use today) in Montreux, and a statue of lead singer Freddie Mercury, who also owned a second home in Montreux, stands on the northern shore of the lake. Writer Vladimir Nabokov also took residence in Montreux, where he died in 1977. Ex-Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher lives with his family in a home overlooking the lake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLake Geneva region\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLake Geneva Region\nInternational Commission for the Protection of Lake Geneva (CIPEL)\nLake Geneva in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of 117 mm (4.6 in) of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 67 mm (2.6 in) of precipitation over 8.8 days.\nThe USDA Hardiness Zone for Lausanne-Pully is 8b with an average minimum temperature of \u22127.0 C over the past 20 years (1997\u20132016), but at the lake level, it can be considered 9a.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, chief argent.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe city is divided into 18 quartiers, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighborhoods. They are: Centre (1), Maupas/Valency (2), S\u00e9beillon/Malley (3), Montoie/Bourdonnette (4), Montriond/Cour (5), Sous-Gare/Ouchy (6), Montchoisi (7), Florimont/Chissiez (8), Mousquines/Bellevue (9), Vallon/B\u00e9thusy (10), Chailly/Rov\u00e9r\u00e9az (11), Sallaz/Vennes/S\u00e9chaud (12), Sauvabelin (13), Borde/Bellevaux (14), Vinet/Pontaise (15), Bossons/Bl\u00e9cherette (16), Beaulieu/Grey/Boisy (17), and Les Zones foraines (90)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe municipality (la Municipalit\u00e9) constitutes the executive government of the City of Lausanne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of seven councilors (French: conseiller municipal/conseill\u00e8re municipale), each presiding over a directorate. One of the members act as mayor (syndic). In the mandate period 2016\u20132021 (la l\u00e9gislature) the Municipality is presided by Monsieur le Syndic Gr\u00e9goire Junod. Directoral tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Communal Council are carried by the Municipality. The regular election of the Municipality by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every five years. Any resident of Lausanne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipality. Since 14 April 2003, due to the constitution by canton of Vaud not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of at least 10 years in Switzerland and 3 years in the canton of Vaud. The current mandate period is from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is later on elected as such by a public election as well by a system of Majorz, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Town Hall (L'H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de la Palud.As of 2016, Lausanne's Municipality is made up of three representatives of the PS (Social Democratic Party, of whom one is also the mayor), and two members of PES (Green Party), and one each of le Parti Ouvrier et Populaire Vaudois (POP) & gauche en mouvement (an alliance of the left parties POP (Parti Suisse du Travail \u2013 Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidarit\u00e9S and ind\u00e9pendant.e.s), and PLR (Les Lib\u00e9raux-Radicaux (PLR)), giving the left parties a very strong six out of seven seats. The last election was held on 28 February/20 March 2016.

It is made up of 100 members, with elections held every five years. The Communal Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipality and the administration. The sessions of the Communal Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipality, members of the Communal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance.

        "wiki": "Ouchy is a port and a popular lakeside resort south of the centre of Lausanne in Switzerland, at the edge of Lake Geneva (French: lac L\u00e9man).\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nVery popular with tourists for the views of nearby France (\u00c9vian-les-Bains, Thonon), Ouchy is also a favorite area for rollerskating (Lausanne, and Ouchy in particular, is considered a capital for this sport) and for skateboarding.  The incredible views of the lake and the Alps, and the cooler air in summer have made Ouchy a popular place especially in the summer months.\nThere is a major cluster of hotels \u2013 the Beau-Rivage Palace, the Ch\u00e2teau d'Ouchy, the M\u00f6venpick hotel, etc. \u2013 and restaurants around the port. It is served by Lausanne Metro Line 2 from Ouchy station. In 2015, the metro station \"Ouchy\" was renamed \"Ouchy-Olympique\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the installation of the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.\nThe headquarters of the International Olympic Committee are at Vidy, to the west of Ouchy. The Olympic Museum and the Olympic Park (sculpture garden between the museum and the lake) are in Ouchy.\n\n\n== History ==\nOnce a fishing village, Ouchy was incorporated into the city of Lausanne in the mid-19th century to serve as a port on Lake Geneva.\nLinks between the port and the city centre were improved in 1877 when Switzerland's first funicular opened. The line was converted to a rack railway in 1954, with a maintenance depot located at the Ouchy station. Eventually renamed M\u00e9tro Lausanne-Ouchy, the line continued operating until 2006, when it was upgraded to become Lausanne M\u00e9tro line 2.On 18 October 1912, the First Treaty of Lausanne was signed in Ouchy between Italy and the Ottoman Empire, concluding the Italo-Turkish War.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFC Stade Lausanne-Ouchy are based in Ouchy. They gained promotion to the second tier of Swiss professional football in 2019.\n\n\n== In Literature ==\nThe plot of  The Finishing School, a 2004 novel by Scottish author Muriel Spark, is set in 'College Sunrise', a finishing school located in Ouchy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de navigation sur le lac L\u00e9man\n\n\n== External links ==\n Lausanne travel guide from Wikivoyage\n Media related to Ouchy at Wikimedia Commons\n\nPage on the website of the City of Lausanne",

        "wiki": "Taye Ismaila Taiwo (born 16 April 1985) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a defender for RoPS Rovaniemi.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Lobi Stars ===\nAfter spending a year at Nigeria Division 1 club Gabros International, Taiwo was bought by Nigeria Premier League side, Lobi Stars. He spent one season at Lobi Stars.\n\n\n=== Olympique de Marseille ===\nIn 2005, at the age of 20, Taiwo was signed by French club, Olympique de Marseille. Taiwo was brought in to fill the void Bixente Lizarazu had left when he departed for Bayern Munich. The Nigerian left back scored Marseille's winning goal against Olympique Lyonnais on 21 March 2010, with a trademark left-footed strike from long range. He also scored Marseille's winning goal against US Boulogne on 17 April 2010. On 23 April 2011, Taiwo scored the only goal at the Stade de France against Montpellier HSC to win the 2011 Coupe de la Ligue. After the match, Taiwo grabbed a microphone and joined fans in singing an expletive-laden chant aimed at the club's rivals PSG, narrowly escaping a ban from the LFP. However, Taiwo received a one-match ban for his action, missing out on the last games of the season, which could have been his last match and since apologised. Though keen to sign a contract with the club, Taiwo announced that he would leave Marseille at the end of the 2010\u201311 season, to seek new challenge elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Milan ===\n\nOn 9 May 2011, A.C. Milan coach, Massimiliano Allegri, confirmed the signing of Taiwo along with French defender Philippe Mex\u00e8s. The two were to play for Milan for the 2011\u201312 season. He made his debut with the club on 24 September 2011 in the home league match won 1\u20130 against Cesena where he was eventually replaced by Luca Antonini. In December 2011, Taiwo made an interview for the French sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe where he said that he was disappointed with his current experience at A.C. Milan, commenting on problems with Massimiliano Allegri and on the fact that he wasn't playing. Despite the player spending much time on the substitutes bench, Taiwo iterated that he remained committed to the Italian club.\n\n\n=== Queens Park Rangers ===\nOn 24 January 2012, Queens Park Rangers secured the signing of Taiwo from A.C. Milan on a loan deal until the end of the season, with the option to buy for a fee of around \u00a33.5 million. After making a move to QPR, Taiwo said he was expecting to make an impact at the club, rather than sitting on the bench. He made his debut on 1 February against Aston Villa in Birmingham, in a match which ended 2\u20132. After making two appearance at Queens Park Rangers so far, Taiwo claimed that he would stay at QPR. He scored his first goal for QPR through a fantastic executed curling effort from a free kick 27 yards out in a 3\u20131 defeat against Sunderland on 24 March 2012.\n\n\n=== Dynamo Kyiv ===\nOn 31 July 2012, Taiwo joined Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv on a one-year loan deal with the option of making the move permanent at the end of the season.\n\n\n=== Bursaspor ===\nOn 5 July 2013, Taiwo signed a three-year deal with Turkish side Bursaspor. He was linked with a move to the Premier League by joining newly promoted club Cardiff City, but opted to move to Turkey. On 1 August 2013, Taiwo scored on his Bursaspor debut, in a 2\u20132 draw Vojvodina in the first leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie. On 27 April 2015, Taiwo mutually agreed to have his contract terminated with Bursaspor.\n\n\n=== HJK ===\n\nOn 23 August 2015, Taiwo joined Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi for the remainder of the season with an option for a one additional year. In October of the same year, HJK exercised their option of keeping Taiwo under contract for the 2016 season. Taiwo called time on his playing career with HJK after their final league game against SJK on 23 October 2016.\n\n\n=== Lausanne-Sport ===\nOn 30 January 2017, Taiwo signed for Lausanne until the end of the 2016\u201317 season.\n\n\n=== AFC Eskilstuna ===\nTaiwo joined Allsvenskan side AFC Eskilstuna for the remainder of the season August 2017.\n\n\n=== Rovaniemen Palloseura ===\nIn 2018, Taiwo joined Veikkausliiga side Rovaniemen Palloseura for the season 2018.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 19 October 20191 Includes Troph\u00e9e des champions\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 29 February 2012\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nAs of 15 November 2014\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaye Taiwo \u2013 FIFA competition record",

        "wiki": "Lausanne (, also US: , French: [lozan], German: [lo\u02c8zan]; Arpitan: Losena [l\u0254\u02c8z\u0259na] (listen); Italian: Losanna; Romansh: Losanna) is the capital city and biggest town of the canton of Vaud in Romandy, Switzerland. A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation.

        "wiki": "Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin  (16 April 1889 \u2013 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, \"The Tramp\", and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.\nChaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship, as his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, and he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.\nIn 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He initially refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. He became increasingly political, and his first sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, and some members of the press and public found his involvement in a paternity suit, and marriages to much younger women, scandalous. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).\nChaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work. He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on lists of the greatest films of all time.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131913: Early years ===\n\n\n==== Background and childhood hardship ====\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son \u2013 George Wheeler Dryden \u2013 fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory \"the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told\" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson. Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old. The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as \"a forlorn existence\". He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.\nI was hardly aware of a crisis because we lived in a continual crisis; and, being a boy, I dismissed our troubles with gracious forgetfulness.\nIn September 1898, Hannah was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum \u2013 she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition. For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney \u2013 who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier \u2013 returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. \"There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate\", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.\n\n\n==== Young performer ====\n\nBetween his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: \"[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman's production of Sherlock Holmes, where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes. \"It was like tidings from heaven\", Chaplin recalled. At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905. He completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.\n\n\n==== Stage comedy and vaudeville ====\nChaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother \u2013 who was also pursuing an acting career \u2013 in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.\n\nMeanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a \"pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster\" who \"looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre.\" However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit. The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as \"one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here\". His most successful role was a drunk called the \"Inebriate Swell\", which drew him significant recognition. The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912. Chaplin recalled that he \"had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness\" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.\n\n\n=== 1914\u20131917: Entering films ===\n\n\n==== Keystone ====\nSix months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave. Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies \"a crude m\u00e9lange of rough and rumble\", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: \"Besides, it would mean a new life.\" He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week contract in September 1913. Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles in early December, and began working for the Keystone studio on 5 January 1914.\n\nChaplin's boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young. He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking. The one-reeler Making a Living marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as \"a comedian of the first water\". For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:\n\nI wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large ... I added a small moustache, which, I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born.\nThe film was Mabel's Strange Predicament, but \"the Tramp\" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in Kid Auto Races at Venice \u2013 shot later than Mabel's Strange Predicament but released two days earlier on 7 February 1914. Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors. During the filming of his eleventh picture, Mabel at the Wheel, he clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films. Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 ($38,803 in 2019 dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.Caught in the Rain, issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplin's directorial debut and was highly successful. Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone, at the rate of approximately one per week, a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career. Chaplin's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce, and he developed a large fan base. In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film, Tillie's Punctured Romance, directed by Sennett and starring Marie Dressler, which was a commercial success and increased his popularity. When Chaplin's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week ($25,869 in 2019 dollars) \u2013 an amount Sennett refused as too large.\n\n\n==== Essanay ====\n\nThe Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914, where he began forming a stock company of regular players, actors he worked with again and again, including Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady \u2013 Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a caf\u00e9 and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years; the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film. There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, A Night Out, and his third, The Champion. The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace. Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its \"mean, crude, and brutish\" nature. The character became more gentle and romantic; The Tramp (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development. The use of pathos was developed further with The Bank, in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work. At Essanay, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, Chaplin \"found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world.\"During 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him. In July, a journalist for Motion Picture Magazine wrote that \"Chaplinitis\" had spread across America. As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star. When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915, Chaplin \u2013 fully aware of his popularity \u2013 requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including Universal, Fox, and Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.\n\n\n==== Mutual ====\n\nA contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year ($15.7 million today), which Robinson says made Chaplin \u2013 at 26 years old \u2013 one of the highest paid people in the world. The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him.\"Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916. He added two key members to his stock company, Albert Austin and Eric Campbell, and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: The Floorwalker, The Fireman, The Vagabond, One A.M., and The Count. For The Pawnshop, he recruited the actor Henry Bergman, who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years. Behind the Screen and The Rink completed Chaplin's releases for 1916. The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which he had managed to achieve. With the new year, however, Chaplin began to demand more time. He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917: Easy Street, The Cure, The Immigrant, and The Adventurer. With their careful construction, these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work.  Later in life, Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career. However, Chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.\nChaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the First World War. He defended himself, claiming that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country. Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops, and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. Harper's Weekly reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was \"a part of the common language of almost every country\", and that the Tramp image was \"universally familiar\". In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action, and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp. The same year, a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that Chaplin was \"an American obsession\". The actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote that \"a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius\".\n\n\n=== 1918\u20131922: First National ===\n\nIn January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together.Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, \"Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants ... It is quality, not quantity, we are after.\" In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1 million ($20 million today). He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.A Dog's Life, released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as \"a sort of Pierrot\". The film was described by Louis Delluc as \"cinema's first total work of art\". Chaplin then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War. He also produced a short propaganda film at his own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called The Bond. Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for Shoulder Arms. Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but, as he later recalled: \"Dangerous or not, the idea excited me.\" He spent four months filming the 45-minute-long picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.\n\n\n==== United Artists, Mildred Harris, and The Kid ====\nAfter the release of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith to form a new distribution company \u2013 United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners \u2013 all creative artists \u2013 to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed.\n\nBefore the creation of United Artists, Chaplin married for the first time. The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris had revealed that she was pregnant with his child, and in September 1918, he married her quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy. Soon after, the pregnancy was found to be false. Chaplin was unhappy with the union and, feeling that marriage stunted his creativity, struggled over the production of his film Sunnyside. Harris was by then legitimately pregnant, and on 7 July 1919, gave birth to a son. Norman Spencer Chaplin was born malformed and died three days later. The marriage ended in April 1920, with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were \"irreconcilably mismated\".Losing the child, plus his own childhood experiences, are thought to have influenced Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, \"make his mark on a changed world.\" Filming on The Kid began in August 1919, with four-year-old Jackie Coogan his co-star. The Kid was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent\u2013child separation, The Kid was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama. It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.Chaplin spent five months on his next film, the two-reeler The Idle Class. Following its September 1921 release, he chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade. He then worked to fulfil his First National contract, releasing Pay Day in February 1922. The Pilgrim \u2013 his final short film \u2013 was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio, and released a year later.\n\n\n=== 1923\u20131938: Silent features ===\n\n\n==== A Woman of Paris and The Gold Rush ====\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, \"men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them\". A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office disappointment. The filmmaker was hurt by this failure \u2013 he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result \u2013 and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation.\n\nChaplin returned to comedy for his next project. Setting his standards high, he told himself \"This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!\" Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846\u201347, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls \"an epic comedy out of grim subject matter.\" In The Gold Rush, the Tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and looking for love. With Georgia Hale as his new leading lady, Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924. Its elaborate production, costing almost $1 million, included location shooting in the Truckee mountains in Nevada with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and special effects. The last scene was shot in May 1925 after 15 months of filming.Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was the best film he had made. It opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a U.S. box-office of $5 million. The comedy contains some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the \"Dance of the Rolls\". Macnab has called it \"the quintessential Chaplin film\". Chaplin stated at its release, \"This is the picture that I want to be remembered by\".\n\n\n==== Lita Grey and The Circus ====\n\nWhile making The Gold Rush, Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.It was an unhappy marriage, and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife. In November 1926, Grey took the children and left the family home. A bitter divorce followed, in which Grey's application \u2013 accusing Chaplin of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring \"perverted sexual desires\" \u2013 was leaked to the press. Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned. Eager to end the case without further scandal, Chaplin's lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000 \u2013 the largest awarded by American courts at that time. His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident, and it was soon forgotten, but Chaplin was deeply affected by it.Before the divorce suit was filed, Chaplin had begun work on a new film, The Circus. He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus. Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal, and it was generally a trouble-ridden production. Finally completed in October 1927, The Circus was released in January 1928 to a positive reception. At the 1st Academy Awards, Chaplin was given a special trophy \"For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing The Circus\". Despite its success, he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production; Chaplin omitted The Circus from his autobiography, and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years.\n\n\n==== City Lights ====\nI was determined to continue making silent films ... I was a pantomimist and in that medium I was unique and, without false modesty, a master.\nBy the time The Circus was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films. Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that \"talkies\" lacked the artistry of silent films. He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal. He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.\n\nWhen filming began at the end of 1928, Chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year. City Lights followed the Tramp's love for a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) and his efforts to raise money for her sight-saving operation. It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months, with Chaplin later confessing that he \"had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection\". One advantage Chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film, which he composed himself.Chaplin finished editing City Lights in December 1930, by which time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, \"Nobody in the world but Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk.\" Given its general release in January 1931, City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success \u2013 eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as \"the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies\". City Lights became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.\n\n\n==== Travels, Paulette Goddard, and Modern Times ====\nCity Lights had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned.\" In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan. The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident. The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date.\n\nIn his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, \"I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness\". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China. Chaplin's loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship. He was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.Modern Times was announced by Chaplin as \"a satire on certain phases of our industrial life.\" Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the Great Depression, it took ten and a half months to film. Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals. Like its predecessor, Modern Times employed sound effects but almost no speaking. Chaplin's performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film. After recording the music, Chaplin released Modern Times in February 1936. It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism, a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin's attempts to downplay the issue. The film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising. Today, Modern Times is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin's \"great features,\" while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at \"his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy.\"Following the release of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard for a trip to the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin revealed that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.\n\n\n=== 1939\u20131952: Controversies and fading popularity ===\n\n\n==== The Great Dictator ====\n\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics, Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work.  Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.Chaplin spent two years developing the script, and began filming in September 1939 \u2013 six days after Britain declared war on Germany. He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk. \"I was determined to go ahead,\" he later wrote, \"for Hitler must be laughed at.\" Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with \"A Jewish Barber\", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish. In a dual performance, he also played the dictator \"Adenoid Hynkel\", who parodied Hitler.The Great Dictator spent a year in production and was released in October 1940. The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for The New York Times calling it \"the most eagerly awaited picture of the year\", and it was one of the biggest money-makers of the era. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin's popularity, and writes, \"Henceforth, no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [his] star image\". The Great Dictator received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.\n\n\n==== Legal troubles and Oona O'Neill ====\nIn the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image. The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942. Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him.The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, who had long been suspicious of Chaplin's political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him. As part of a smear campaign to damage Chaplin's image, the FBI named him in four indictments related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes. The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an \"absurd prosecution\" of an \"ancient statute\", yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail. Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began on 21 March 1944. Chaplin was acquitted two weeks later, on 4 April. The case was frequently headline news, with Newsweek calling it the \"biggest public relations scandal since the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial in 1921.\"\n\nBarry's child, Carol Ann, was born in October 1943, and the paternity suit went to court in December 1944. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of \"moral turpitude\", Chaplin was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible, and the judge ordered Chaplin to pay child support until Carol Ann turned 21. Media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the FBI, as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.The controversy surrounding Chaplin increased when, two weeks after the paternity suit was filed, it was announced that he had married his newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, 18-year-old Oona O'Neill \u2013 daughter of the American playwright Eugene O'Neill. Chaplin, then 54, had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier. In his autobiography, Chaplin described meeting O'Neill as \"the happiest event of my life\", and claimed to have found \"perfect love\". Chaplin's son, Charles Jr., reported that Oona \"worshipped\" his father. The couple remained married until Chaplin's death, and had eight children over 18 years: Geraldine Leigh (b. July 1944), Michael John (b. March 1946), Josephine Hannah (b. March 1949), Victoria (b. May 1951), Eugene Anthony (b. August 1953), Jane Cecil (b. May 1957), Annette Emily (b. December 1959), and Christopher James (b. July 1962).\n\n\n==== Monsieur Verdoux and communist accusations ====\n\nChaplin claimed that the Barry trials had \"crippled [his] creativeness\", and it was some time before he began working again. In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942. Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Landru. Chaplin decided that the concept would \"make a wonderful comedy\", and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.Chaplin again vocalised his political views in Monsieur Verdoux, criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction. Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947; Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott. Monsieur Verdoux was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States. It was more successful abroad, and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards. He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, \"Monsieur Verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made.\"The negative reaction to Monsieur Verdoux was largely the result of changes in Chaplin's public image. Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a communist. His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various Soviet\u2013American friendship groups. He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles. In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, \"dangerously progressive and amoral.\" The FBI wanted him out of the country, and launched an official investigation in early 1947.Chaplin denied being a communist, instead calling himself a \"peacemonger\", but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told Congress in June 1947: \"[Chaplin's] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported] ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once.\"\n\n\n==== Limelight and banning from the United States ====\n\nAlthough Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.Filming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story. He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word \"melancholy\" when explaining his plans to his co-star Claire Bloom. Limelight featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton, whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of Limelight in London, since it was the setting of the film. As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning. At New York, he boarded the RMS Queen Elizabeth with his family on 18 September 1952. The next day, United States Attorney General James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour to re-enter the US. Although McGranery told the press that he had \"a pretty good case against Chaplin\", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it. However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:\n\nWhether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity...\nBecause all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press. The scandal attracted vast attention, but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe. In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, Limelight was subjected to a wide-scale boycott. Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplin's fall, from an \"unprecedented\" level of popularity, \"may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America\".\n\n\n=== 1953\u20131977: European years ===\n\n\n==== Move to Switzerland and A King in New York ====\nI have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted. Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.\nChaplin did not attempt to return to the United States after his re-entry permit was revoked, and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs. The couple decided to settle in Switzerland and, in January 1953, the family moved into their permanent home: Manoir de Ban, a 14-hectare (35-acre) estate overlooking Lake Geneva in Corsier-sur-Vevey. Chaplin put his Beverly Hills house and studio up for sale in March, and surrendered his re-entry permit in April. The next year, his wife renounced her US citizenship and became a British citizen. Chaplin severed the last of his professional ties with the United States in 1955, when he sold the remainder of his stock in United Artists, which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s.Chaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially after he was awarded the International Peace Prize by the communist-led World Peace Council, and after his meetings with Zhou Enlai and Nikita Khrushchev. He began developing his first European film, A King in New York, in 1954. Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay. His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplin's character faces accusations of communism. The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture \u2013 including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema. In a review, the playwright John Osborne called it Chaplin's \"most bitter\" and \"most openly personal\" film. In a 1957 interview, when asked to clarify his political views, Chaplin stated \"As for politics, I am an anarchist. I hate government and rules \u2013 and fetters ... People must be free.\"Chaplin founded a new production company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of the film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris premi\u00e8re and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.\n\n\n==== Final works and renewed appreciation ====\n\nIn the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\". The first of these re-releases was The Chaplin Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim.In America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that \"we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port\". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book became a worldwide best-seller. It focused on his early years and personal life, and was criticised for lacking information on his film career.Shortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.Chaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s, which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, The Freak, a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including The Kid and The Circus. In 1971, he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival.\n\nIn 1972, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered Chaplin an Honorary Award, which Robinson sees as a sign that America \"wanted to make amends\". Chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to the US for the first time in 20 years. The visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and, at the Academy Awards gala, he was given a 12-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy's history. Visibly emotional, Chaplin accepted his award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\".Although Chaplin still had plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s he was very frail. He experienced several further strokes, which made it difficult for him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.\n\n\n==== Death ====\n\nBy October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care. In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes. Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery. Among the film industry's tributes, director Ren\u00e9 Clair wrote, \"He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times ... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us.\" Actor Bob Hope declared, \"We were lucky to have lived in his time.\"On 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants, Roman Wardas, from Poland, and Gantcho Ganev, from Bulgaria. The body was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from Oona Chaplin. The pair were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of Noville. It was re-interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete.\n\n\n== Filmmaking ==\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno.  Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.\n\n\n=== Method ===\n\nChaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians \u2013 particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) \u2013 has since revealed his unique working method.Until he began making spoken dialogue films with The Great Dictator, Chaplin never shot from a completed script. Many of his early films began with only a vague premise \u2013 for example \"Charlie enters a health spa\" or \"Charlie works in a pawn shop.\" He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and \"business\" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story. From A Woman of Paris onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot, but Robinson writes that every film up to Modern Times \"went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form.\"Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time. If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism. According to his friend Ivor Montagu, \"nothing but perfection would be right\" for the filmmaker. Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid. For The Immigrant, a 20-minute short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film\u2014enough for a feature-length.\nNo other filmmaker ever so completely dominated every aspect of the work, did every job. If he could have done so, Chaplin would have played every role and (as his son Sydney humorously but perceptively observed) sewn every costume.\nDescribing his working method as \"sheer perseverance to the point of madness\", Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued \"to take precedence over everything and everyone else.\" The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism \u2013 which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense \u2013 often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures, to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly.  He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted. As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers. Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner.\n\n\n=== Style and themes ===\n\nWhile Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick, it is considered restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of \"deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags\". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's \"quirky mannerisms\" and \"serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action\" are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.Chaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, \"The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity.\" The Tramp defies authority figures and \"gives as good as he gets\", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged \u2013 an \"everyman turned heroic saviour\". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with \"the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically ... into the sunset ... to continue his journey\".\nIt is paradoxical that tragedy stimulates the spirit of ridicule ... ridicule, I suppose, is an attitude of defiance; we must laugh in the face of our helplessness against the forces of nature \u2013 or go insane.\nThe infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of Chaplin's work, and Larcher notes his reputation for \"[inducing] laughter and tears\". Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing \"personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements.\" Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of The Gold Rush (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party. Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (The Gold Rush) and loss (The Kid). Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (The Immigrant, 1917); illegitimacy (The Kid, 1921); and drug use (Easy Street, 1917). He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.Several of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin \"always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth\". The Kid is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in Limelight (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents, and A King in New York references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.Regarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9: \"Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors\". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, \"Simplicity is best ... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant ... The camera should not intrude.\"  This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being \"old fashioned\", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an \"ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium\".\n\n\n=== Composing ===\n\nChaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack \u2013 composed by himself \u2013 for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.As Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for City Lights. Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin \u2013 who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times \u2013 stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin. According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, \"although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent.\"Chaplin's compositions produced three popular songs. \"Smile\", composed originally for Modern Times (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954. For Limelight, Chaplin composed \"Terry's Theme\", which was popularised by Jimmy Young as \"Eternally\" (1952). Finally, \"This Is My Song\", performed by Petula Clark for A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts. Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the Limelight theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film's re-release.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon\". He is described by the British Film Institute as \"a towering figure in world culture\", and was included in Time magazine's list of the \"100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\" for the \"laughter [he brought] to millions\" and because he \"more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art\".The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history; according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown. The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the \"unique\" and \"indelible\" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his \"worldwide impact\". Praising the character, Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most \"eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit\" in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin \"changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar\" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of \"sophisticated comedy\". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were \"rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft.\" Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin \"a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended\"), Jacques Tati (\"Without him I would never have made a film\"), Ren\u00e9 Clair (\"He inspired practically every filmmaker\"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as \"the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old.\"\n\nChaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. Marcel Marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin, while the actor Raj Kapoor based his screen persona on the Tramp. Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin's comedic style in the French character Monsieur Hulot and the Italian character Tot\u00f2. In other fields, Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, and was an influence on the Dada art movement. As one of the founding members of United Artists, Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like MGM or Paramount Pictures, the idea that directors could produce their own films was \"years ahead of its time\".In the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 Sight & Sound poll, which compiles \"top ten\" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,\nsaw City Lights rank among the critics' top 50, Modern Times inside the top 100, and The Great Dictator and The Gold Rush placed in the top 250. The top 100 films as voted on by directors included Modern Times at number 22, City Lights at number 30, and The Gold Rush at number 91. Every one of Chaplin's features received a vote. In 2007, the American Film Institute named City Lights the 11th greatest American film of all time, while The Gold Rush and Modern Times again ranked in the top 100. Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly, and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists. Many of Chaplin's film have had a DVD and Blu-ray release.Chaplin's legacy is managed on behalf of his children by the Chaplin office, located in Paris. The office represents Association Chaplin, founded by some of his children \"to protect the name, image and moral rights\" to his body of work, Roy Export SAS, which owns the copyright to most of his films made after 1918, and Bubbles Incorporated S.A., which owns the copyrights to his image and name. Their central archive is held at the archives of Montreux, Switzerland and scanned versions of its contents, including 83,630 images, 118 scripts, 976 manuscripts, 7,756 letters, and thousands of other documents, are available for research purposes at the Chaplin Research Centre at the Cineteca di Bologna. The photographic archive, which includes approximately 10,000 photographs from Chaplin's life and career, is kept at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Elys\u00e9e in Lausanne, Switzerland. The British Film Institute has also established the Charles Chaplin Research Foundation, and the first international Charles Chaplin Conference was held in London in July 2005.  Elements for many of Chaplin's films are held by the Academy Film Archive as part of the Roy Export Chaplin Collection. \n\n\n=== Commemoration and tributes ===\nChaplin's final home, Manoir de Ban in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named \"Chaplin's World\". It opened on 17 April 2016 after 15 years of development, and is described by Reuters as \"an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin\". On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum. Previously, the Museum of the Moving Image in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988. The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called Charlie Chaplin \u2013 The Great Londoner, from 2010 until 2013.In London, a statue of Chaplin as the Tramp, sculpted by John Doubleday and unveiled in 1981, is located in Leicester Square. The city also includes a road named after him in central London, \"Charlie Chaplin Walk\", which is the location of the BFI IMAX. There are nine blue plaques memorialising Chaplin in London, Hampshire, and Yorkshire. The Swiss town of Vevey named a park in his honour in 1980 and erected a statue there in 1982. In 2011, two large murals depicting Chaplin on two 14-storey buildings were also unveiled in Vevey. Chaplin has also been honoured by the Irish town of Waterville, where he spent several summers with his family in the 1960s. A statue was erected in 1998; since 2011, the town has been host to the annual Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival, which was founded to celebrate Chaplin's legacy and to showcase new comic talent.In other tributes, a minor planet, 3623 Chaplin \u2013 discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina in 1981 \u2013 is named after Chaplin. Throughout the 1980s, the Tramp image was used by IBM to advertise their personal computers. Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world, and on 15 April 2011, a day before his 122nd birthday, Google celebrated him with a special Google Doodle video on its global and other country-wide homepages. Many countries, spanning six continents, have honoured Chaplin with a postal stamp.\n\n\n=== Characterisations ===\nChaplin is the subject of a biographical film, Chaplin (1992) directed by Richard Attenborough, and starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role and Geraldine Chaplin playing Hannah Chaplin. He is also a character in the historical drama film The Cat's Meow (2001), played by Eddie Izzard, and in the made-for-television movie The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980), played by Clive Revill. A television series about Chaplin's childhood, Young Charlie Chaplin, ran on PBS in 1989, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program. The French film The Price of Fame (2014) is a fictionalised account of the robbery of Chaplin's grave.Chaplin's life has also been the subject of several stage productions. Two musicals, Little Tramp and Chaplin, were produced in the early 1990s. In 2006, Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical, Limelight: The Story of Charlie Chaplin, which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for Broadway two years later, re-titled Chaplin \u2013 A Musical. Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, two plays about Chaplin premiered in Finland: Chaplin at the Svenska Teatern, and Kulkuri (The Tramp) at the Tampere Workers' Theatre.Chaplin has also been characterised in literary fiction. He is the protagonist of Robert Coover's short story \"Charlie in the House of Rue\" (1980; reprinted in Coover's 1987 collection A Night at the Movies), and of Glen David Gold's Sunnyside (2009), a historical novel set in the First World War period. A day in Chaplin's life in 1909 is dramatised in the chapter titled \"Modern Times\" in Alan Moore's Jerusalem (2016), a novel set in the author's home town of Northampton, England.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\nChaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life. In the 1975 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE). He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962. In 1965, he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government.From the film industry, Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year. The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award. Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs.Chaplin received three Academy Awards: an Honorary Award for \"versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing, and producing The Circus\" in 1929, a second Honorary Award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\" in 1972, and a Best Score award in 1973 for Limelight (shared with Ray Rasch and Larry Russell). He was further nominated in the Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture (as producer) categories for The Great Dictator, and received another Best Original Screenplay nomination for Monsieur Verdoux. In 1976, Chaplin was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).Six of Chaplin's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nDirected features:\n\nThe Kid (1921)\nA Woman of Paris (1923)\nThe Gold Rush (1925)\nThe Circus (1928)\nCity Lights (1931)\nModern Times (1936)\nThe Great Dictator (1940)\nMonsieur Verdoux (1947)\nLimelight (1952)\nA King in New York (1957)\nA Countess from Hong Kong (1967)\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuster Keaton\nHarold Lloyd\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website by Association Chaplin\nCharlie Chaplin at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nCharlie Chaplin on IMDb\nCharlie Chaplin at the TCM Movie Database \nWorks by Charlie Chaplin at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Charlie Chaplin at Internet Archive\nWorks by Charlie Chaplin at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nWorks by Charlie Chaplin at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nNewspaper clippings about  Charlie Chaplin in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW\nThe Marvelous Boy of the Movies by Charlie Chaplin: Vanity Fair, 1922\nWithout The Cain and The Derby, a poem by Carl Sandburg: Vanity Fair, May, 1922\nCharlie Chaplin at Find a Grave",

          "As a HUGE fan of Chaplin\u2019s, getting to be in his house and seeing all his personal things was a thrill for my husband. Chaplin\u2019s World was the purpose of our trip to Vevey. Not knowing much about Chaplin it was very enjoyable for me as well. The whole experience is very well",
          "Visiting the museum was interesting. We started in the manor house and its enormous park, where we learned more about Chaplin\u2019s private life. Then we had a look at the new building, which focuses on his artistic work.",

          "The place is well designed and very pleasant. However, from the rave reviews on this site it was not clear to me that this was really more a mix of Madame Tussaud's and Universal Studios. It was entertaining but I did not actually \"learn\" anything or find anything surprising. I",

          "This place was a nice introduction and explanation of Charlie Chaplins life, not knowing much before we went. It is a shame there is not more guidance - as another reviewer explained there is a 10 minute movie then you are left alone to wander through streets, waxworks, movies",
          "My wife and I visited Chaplin World on 8/6/17. The site is Charlie Chaplin's estate overlooking Lake Geneva. We took an interesting self-guided tour of the estate which showcased Charlie's film and acting career. The museum and garden were amazing! There is a lot of interaction",

          "The visit took 2 hours. Entrance price per person 24CHF plus 4 for the parking. Quite some waiting time as several coaches arrived at the same time, around 10am. The visit of the manor was difficult due to the same crowd. It gives an idea of the lifestyle of a rich expatriate",
          "This is a well thought out museum. The history of Charlie Chaplin's life and work has been well documented. On this day when I visited members of the public had been invited to come disguised as Chaplin and so the whole compound was crawling with look a-likes. They later took",

          "Our whole family is full of Chaplin fans - it felt like a holy pilgrimage for us... Starts off with an intro film - then you go through the studio and sets, which is an amazing experience - recaptures the film making in that period accurately with mouth watering treat of clips",
          "Great experience both for adults and for kids. The tour takes about 2-2.5 hours and literally flies by. The place is very nicely done. Full of Chaplin's movies but very interesting even for those that are not particular fans. Our kids of 11, 8 and 3 all enjoyed the tour too.",
          "I have travelled close to a hundred countries, and Chaplin's World is one of the very best museum I have ever had the pleasure to visit. It is worth traveling to Switzerland just for itself. Set in the Chaplin estate in Corsier, in the beautiful Vevey and Geneva Lake area,",
          "The set up could have been tacky but instead is surprisingly understated. A real treat. You would expect it to be boring for children but they were excited and immersed in the fun of the films and the sets where they could join the adults in enjoying the tableaux. The shop as",

          "A different way of understanding Charlie Chaplin. Interactive, fun, amazing. If you Are a Movie lover, you can't miss it. It is divided in 2 parts, Charlie the film maker and Charlie the man. Not cheap, but what is in Switzerland??.",
          "This museum was opened one year ago. It is done in a very modern way. The site consists of three parts. Chaplin' house, the studios, and the garden . Modern museum. You need a good three hours to give it justice. There is a resturant attached where you can have a light meal.",
          "It was a wonderful experience visiting the house of the legend who made us laugh . The gardens, Studio and taking a look at statues of other legends like Micheal Jackson , Laurel & Hardy brings back nostalgic memories. As a child , I have wonderful memories of watching these",

        "wiki": "The Blonay\u2013Chamby museum railway (French: Chemin de fer-mus\u00e9e Blonay-Chamby, BC) is a short 3-kilometre-long (1.9 mi) steep but adhesion worked metre gauge heritage railway operated as part of the Blonay - Chamby Railway Museum using vintage steam and electric locomotives and rolling stock. It is rail-connected at both ends, at its upper terminus, at Chamby with the Chemin de Fer Montreux Oberland Bernoise and at the lower end, Blonay, with the Vevey - Les Pleiades, Chemin de fer \u00e9lectriques Veveysans, line.\n\n\n== History and Aims ==\nThe Blonay - Chamby Railway and Museum was opened in 1968 with the aims of operating the metre gauge railway line from Blonay to Chamby and in doing so preserving railway equipment of technical or historic value. For this purpose the Blonay - Chamby Railway has purpose built two motive power and carriage depots at Chaulin - Chamby, a short distance from its upper terminus which nowadays houses what is generally regarded as the largest and most representative collection of metre gauge relics in Europe.\n\n\n== The Museum Line ==\nThe Blonay - Chamby Museum Railway is a railway preservation group staffed entirely by volunteers who operate trains each Saturday and Sunday between May and October. Vintage steam locomotives or electric locomotives haul equally vintage carriages slowly through a spectacular environment with fine views over Lake Geneva and the Alps. Visitors can access the shed / museum complex from Chamby, travelling the short distance on a vintage tram.\nA further part of the remit of the preservation group is the encouragement of local and regional tourism and tourist traffic on adjacent lines. The timetable for the Blonay - Chamby line can be found on Table 115 and 115.1 of the Swiss National Railways Timetable.\n\n\n== The Museum Collection ==\nThe collection includes in spring 2009 the following items. The museum is the home of over 70 items of rolling stock.\n\n\n=== Steam Locomotives ===\n\n\n==== Steam Locomotives ====\n\n\n==== Tramway Steam Locomotives ====\n\n\n=== Electric Locomotives, Railcars and Trams ===\n\n\n==== Locomotives ====\n\n\n==== Railcars ====\n\n\n==== Trams ====\n\n\n=== Passenger Coach ===\n\n\n=== Tramway Passenger Coach ===\n\n\n=== Post and Baggage Coach ===\n\n\n=== Goods wagon ===\n\n\n=== Diesel Locomotives, Shunters and Maintenance vehicles ===\n\n\n=== Rotary Snowplow ===\n\n\n=== Service Coach Stock ===\n\n\n=== Placed external line Blonay-Chamby ===\n\n\n=== Former vehicles ===\n\n\n=== Abbreviations (Selection) ===\n\n\n==== Rolling stock manufacturers ====\nBBC :  Brown, Boveri & Cie\nCIE :  Compagnie de l\u2019Industrie \u00c9lectrique, Geneva\nEAG :  Elektrizit\u00e4tsgesellschaft Alioth\nMFE :  Maschinenfabrik Esslingen\nMFO :  Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon\nMGK :  Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe\nMTM :  Maquinista Terrestre y Mar\u00edtima (in Sanish language)\nO&K :  Orenstein & Koppel\nRat :  Rathgeber, Munich\nSAAS : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Ateliers de S\u00e9cheron\nSIG :  Swiss Industrial Society (German language: Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft)\nSLM :  Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, Winterthur (German language: Schweizerische Lokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik)\nSACM :  Alsatian Engineering Company in Grafenstaden (German language: Els\u00e4ssische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden)\nSEG :  South German Railway Company (German language: S\u00fcddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft)\nSWS : Schweizerische Wagons- und Aufz\u00fcgefabrik AG Schlieren-Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n==== Steam Locomotive Cylinders ====\nOC :  Cylinders outside frames\nIC :  Cylinders inside frames\n\n\n== Literature ==\nS\u00e9bastien Jarne, Le chemin de fer-mus\u00e9e Blonay-Chamby, tir\u00e9 \u00e0 part du livre \u00ab Voies \u00e9troites de Veveyse et de Gruy\u00e8re \u00bb, \u00e9dition Chemin de fer-mus\u00e9e Blonay-Chamby, Lausanne, \u00e9d. 2, 1991, 56 p.\nJos\u00e9 Banaudo and Alex Rieben, \u00c0 la d\u00e9couverte du Chemin de fer-mus\u00e9e Blonay-Chamby, \u00c9dition du Cabri, Breil-sur-Roya, 1992, ISBN 978-2-903310-98-1.\nPeter Willen, Lokomotiven und Triebwagen der Schweizer Bahnen, volume 2, Privatbahnen Westschweiz und Wallis.

          "We spent just under an hour here and it was a lovely way of making the most of our time in Yvoire. We enjoyed feeling the different textures of the plants and smelling the herbs (coca-cola was very surprising!)",
          "We visit Yvoire in June which is a beautiful small village and definitely worth a visit. We paid a visit to these gardens which was \u20ac12 euro each (myself and my wife). After the visit, I think this was expensive. It is of medium interest with some interesting plants, mostly",
          "Went to Yvoire for this garden and wasn't disappointed - spent a pleasant hour or so visiting the different gardens - went for lunch and then came back to rest. Lots of plants and is quiet with plenty of birdsong - if that aint your thing, dont go - If it is, highly recommended",
          "There are 8 separate gardens ... and well worth the 12\u20ac adult entry fee. In addition to the five senses, there are alpine meadow, woodlands and medicinal gardens. Great for families too.... quiz available for children. Unique shop",
          "We have visited Yvoire on numerous occasions over the past five years but today was first time we have been able to access the gardens. Well worth the wait. Compact but it is what it claims to be, a sensory garden. The shop is well stocked with plants and seeds that you find in",
          "the goal of this garden is not only to show you flowers, it is to let you smell , touch, taste nature. The garden change along the year through the season so it is well worth it to get the annual pas if you live close enough. the single entrance is 12 euro and the annual pass is",
          "We visited here with family members of all ages. All got immersed in the Garden's wonders - colors, tastes, smells, textures and traditional uses. The garden is packed with interesting plant species, well beyond its perceived size. The adventure-like activity the kids were given",

          "The Jardin des Cinq Sens was an outside activity that took us about an hour and a half to go through--and that was very thoroughly, since my partner loves plants. At this time of year (mid-September) we found that a decent number of the flowering plants were flowering. The",
          "The garden is nice but not excellent, at least in summer. On other side of lake, in Nyon, you can find nicer and free of charge. It is better to skip this garden and just enjoy Yvoire old town.",
          "Le Jardin is a unique experience and well worth the admission fee even if you are not a gardener at heart. In August, some of the plants seemed a little wilted from the heat, but this did not detract from the experience. Informative signs let you learn about some unique plants.",
          "I cannot recommend this garden highly enough! For all - adults, children, even teenagers. We visited with my teenage son and he was particularly taken by the 'taste' and 'smell' sections of the garden. Never thought I'd find a plant whose leaves smell of Coca Cola, or find so",
          "The entrance fee of 12 EUR is not worth a visit at this time of the year. Wonder when it is worth at all. The entire garden is rather small and it could be nice and peaceful without the whole crowd.",
          "Lovely gardens! Well worth the entrance fee! Really enjoyed wandering around the gardens looking at the wonderful variety of trees, shrubs and flowers.",
          "We visited here despite not really being gardeners. We thoroughly enjoyed the gardens and the many plants, as well as the views of the castle and the lake. A very peaceful place to spend and hour or so. We particularly liked the perfumed area which had some old fashioned",
          "12 Euros for a little garden with a few flowers and plants which can be seen in 40 minutes in all? Sorry but this is a touristic scam! If entrance fee was 5 Euros ok. But 12 Euros for that is authorized theft! Just because it is \"private\"? Come on, folks, do not waste your money",

          "When you are in this beautiful town you must visit these gardens. It's quite interactive, you can learn about plants and also touch and smell, which I found lots of fun. I have an ecology degree, so I was also impressed with their collection.",
          "The garden is divided into 9 themed areas. If you have an interest in plants you will find the planting very instructive. For example, one area contains examples of many medicinal plants and the conditions they are used to treat. Another is a sensory garden with plants to touch,",

          "What a lovely afternoon to spend wondering around in these lovely gardens. Just totally amazing and what a great bunch of different plants and flowers, just great! Will definitely come back here again. ;)",
          "We visited this magical garden on a warm and sunny day...so the butterflies were there, bees and birds, a real little wonder and very inspiring for garden-people like us. Lots of different plants, trees, herbs and flowers, assembled in a romantic setting, colourfull and",

          "Firstly I should mention that I thought the entry price was too high. If it also gave entry to the chateau it would have been more realistic but its privately owned and only this garden is open to the public. A high entry cost leads to higher expectations ...... and if I had",
          "Not that exceptional and way overpriced. Only few flowers blooming in may. Felt like a tourist trap. Skip!",

          "The Jardin des Cinq Sens is a lovely garden indeed, although my experience was a bit different from my expectations. The idea of the 'five senses' garden didn't really work for me. The 'scented' garden wasn't particularly exciting from an olfactory sense, and while the 'sight'",
          "This is a very formal garden laid out in rooms representing the various senses. The expertise on pruning of apple trees to produce a cloister effect was particularly impressive, although the fernery was somewhat disappointing. However, having created my own very large garden",
          "It's a beautiful albeit small garden arranged according to sensual experiences. Every time we visit Yvoire we have to enter there since it is my sons (now 12) favorite place. Entrance is quite expensive. Last time I paid 55 Euros for 4 adults and one child.",
          "I'm not a gardener or someone interested in plants in general, but this place's man-made aesthetic value is something that my nature-loving eyes could appreciate. I spent about an hour inside, but unfortunately couldn't obtain much useful information since my French is broken",
          "The reviews and the photos advertising this place all look very impressive and so we put it on our to do list! Although I enjoyed it for perhaps 30 minutes it wasn't what I was expecting..I was expecting a country garden type affair and on a bigger grander scale which it",

          "The medieval village of Yvoire by the lake is one of the most beautiful places I have been! The whole village is a riot of flowers (we were there in August) but because of that the garden of the Five senses was redundant and not worth the relatively high entrance price. Just",

          "I've been to Yvoire many times before and always wondered about Le Jardin des Cinq Sens - it has old walls around the garden so you cannot see the inside. I suppose my wild imagination conjured up images of The Secret Garden or the like! So when a family member, who is a keen",
          "This is a delightful peaceful garden and like an oasis in a very busy village full of tourists. Having said that I felt it was far too expensively priced at more than 11 euros. It is also not at all interesting for children or teenagers as there is not much to keep them",
          "To be honest there is not much to do in Yvoire, so this place sees some good business. You pay over 11 euros per person to see a very nice garden. Unless you live for plants and gardening I recommend using the money for a few beers or wine.",
          "Based on reviews I planned a visit to the garden as \"must do in Yvoire\" and was really disappointed! This garden is really small, not worth the visit and the entrance fees of 10\u20ac. The experience was not up to my expectations. Reviews are overclaimed. Yvoire is a flowery",
          "The kids liked this place and in may we had several flowers and aromated plants. The entrance is not cheap, but conditions are very good and the gardens are in excellent conditions.",
          "Don't miss this superb walled garden - almost a 'secret garden' in its position. It's not open every day so be sure to check times to avoid disappointment. It could be any century once you are inside the walls. Highly memorable and enjoyable.",
          "Visited over the Easter weekend as a family with three children (10, 8&6). We were given a family trail in English of things to find in each of the eight gardens. The gardens are stunning, fantastic variety of plants, colours and smells. A wonderful way to spend 1-2 hours.",

        "wiki": "Amadeus VIII (4 September 1383 \u2013 7 January 1451) was a Savoyard nobleman, the son of Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy and Bonne of Berry. He was surnamed the Peaceful. After the death of his father in 1391, his mother acted as a regent, because of his youth. He was a claimant to the papacy from 1439 to 1449 as Felix V in opposition to Eugene IV and Nicholas V.\n\n\n== Count and duke ==\nBorn at Chamb\u00e9ry, he was the count of Savoy from 1391 to 1416 and was elevated by Emperor Sigismund to duke of Savoy in 1416. In 1418 his distant cousin Louis of Piedmont, his brother-in-law, the last male of the elder branch of House of Savoy, died, leaving Amadeus as his heir-general, thus finally uniting the male-lines of the House of Savoy.\nAmadeus increased his dominions and encouraged several attempts to negotiate an end to the Hundred Years' War. From 1401 to 1422, he campaigned to recover the area around Geneva and Annecy. After the death of his wife, in 1431 he founded the Order of Saint Maurice with six other knights (1434). They lived alone in the castle of Ripaille, near Geneva, in a quasi-monastic state according to a rule drawn up by himself. He appointed his son Louis regent of the duchy.\n\n\n== Antipope ==\nAmadeus had been in close relations with the Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence and was elected at Basel as Pope Felix V, in opposition to Pope Eugene IV. The Cardinal of Arles reminded the Council that they needed a rich and powerful pope to defend it from its adversaries. After long negotiations with a deputation from the council, Amadeus acquiesced in the election, 5 February 1440, completely renouncing at the same time all further participation in the government of his duchy. He named his son Louis, Duke of Savoy, and Philip, Count of Geneva. He reigned from November 1439 to April 1449. His supporters came from the movement to have the Church managed by Ecumenical councils, and prelates like Cardinal Aleman, who wanted to set limits upon the doctrine of Papal supremacy. \nAmadeus' image in history is marred by the account of him as a pontiff concerned with money, to avoid disadvantaging his heirs, found in the Commentaries of Pius II. Nor is there any evidence that he intrigued to obtain the papal office, sending the bishops of Savoy to Basel for this purpose. Of the twelve bishops present, seven were Savoyards. After the death of his opponent Pope Eugene IV in 1447, both sides of the church favoured a settlement of the schism, and in 1449 he accepted the authority of Pope Nicholas V. \n(Note on numbering: When numbering of the Popes began to be used, Antipope Felix II was counted as one of the Popes of that name. The second true Pope Felix is thus known by the number III, and the third true Pope Felix was given the number IV. It also affected the name taken by Amadeus, who would have been the fourth Pope Felix.)\n\n\n== Marriage and issue ==\nHe married Mary of Burgundy (1386\u20131422), daughter of Philip the Bold. They had nine children:\n\nMargaret (13 May 1405 \u2013 1418).\nAnthony (September 1407 \u2013 bef. 12 December 1407).\nAnthony (1408 \u2013 aft. 10 October 1408).\nMarie (end January 1411 \u2013 22 February 1469), married Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan.\nAmadeus (26 Mar 1412 \u2013 17 August 1431), Prince of Piemonte.\nLouis (24 February 1413 \u2013 29 January 1465), his successor.\nBonne (September 1415 \u2013 25 September 1430).\nHugh (1415-1439)\nPhilip (1417 \u2013 3 March 1444), Count of Gen\u00e8ve\nMargaret (7 August 1420 \u2013 30 September 1479), married firstly Louis III, titular king of Naples, secondly Louis IV, Count Palatine of the Rhine and thirdly Ulrich V, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAndenmatten, B.; Paravicini Bagliani, A.

The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation.

          "I like the restaurant and its adjacent kids\u2019 play area.

          "This museum on food is sponsored by Nestl\u00e9 and used to house the offices for that company. There are beautiful views of Lake Geneva (Lac Leman) from there. We enjoyed the many interactive displays especially the sensory exhibits where one can analyze the senses of smell and",

          "Lived the building and the surrounding gardens. The interactive exhibits were fun even without children. U would like to come another time and cook in the giant kitchen school.",
          "This museum does a great job laying out the complex ways food is a part of our lives. It starts with the faces behind food (temporary exhibit possibly) and ends with nutrition. Lots of interactive activities that would be great for kids. Personally, I've been very lucky to",
          "Not a bad place to visit. Perhaps too much reading is required at times and to be honest I lost a bit of interest in reading everything towards the end. Also some if the interactive displays were not functioning. Finally, it was flipping hot inside. The coffee was good in the",
          "Large elegant building that doesn\u2019t provide much content or excitement for visitors. Many of the interactive exhibits didn\u2019t work properly. Many exhibits geared for children but believe many kids would be impatient with slow technology and lack of fun.",

          "Some good stuff here and very well presented but for us oldies not terribly exciting. However, the cafe here serves a brilliant soup and their coffee specialities are great. It is a very relaxing environment and you don\u2019t need an entrance ticket to get in.",
          "This museum not only explains how good is prepared but also cover the nutrition part- what is good or bad for your health, and demonstrates interactively how it is being processed in the human body. Really fun experience for all ages and it is also very nice that it is in the",

          "The museum is an interesting one, mostly for those who doesn't know basic bio-technology. It's good for kids, who understand the language, but could be a bore for tech-savvy individual. Not really a tourist attraction for travellers from far away.",
          "While I was hesitant at first, I went in not knowing what to expect from the 'food museum' and I came out having had the most pleasant of surprises!. The museum is interactive, it really invites you to be curious, to play and discover about nutrition, how certain foods dominated",
          "Went with family. Loads of new and useful about agriculture and food with interactive displays. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours. Great place to visit with kids.",

          "Following our visit to the excellent Nest we had high hopes for the Alimentarium, but were a little disappointed. If you don\u2019t know anything about food production then I imagine you might get something out of this, but I did feel this was a bit like teaching your grandmother to",
          "We loved the interactive games and panels, and kids had a blast! Amazingly we were able to spend more than 4 hours there. There's a kids' corner close to the cafe with games, books and colouring activities for the children to wind down a bit and process everything they saw.",
          "If you ever visit the lakefront of Vevey and couldn't decide where to get lunch, Alimentarium is definitely the place to have your lunch. The restaurant is organized as a training facility for all the chef-to-be. For less than CHF 20, you get to enjoy a full course with side",

          "We travelled to Switzerland in May 2017 on our grand circle of all the countries that circle the alps. We were specifically targetting the Alimemtarium and fork of Vevey but our GPS had difficulty locating it. Travelling in Europe we dont have a data plan for the backup phone",
          "Very interesting exhibition ,well presented (in English, French, German), also for children. Gardens outside are planted with vegetables, fruit and herbs. Has a restaurant offering three different menus. Food delicious and beautifully presented. Some tables in a most interesting",

          "There are three Nestle Museums, but we visited just this one. Located opposite the Charlie Chaplin statue and the large fork just off-shore, it\u2019s about a twenty-minutes\u2019 walk along the lake-front from the Nestle Head Office. The friendly receptionist asked if we\u2019d like to",
          "The museum is small and simple, I dont even understand why they call it \"museum\", it doesnt really look like one. Anyway, it was nice and I dont regret spending one our of my holydays there. The view from the main window is spectacular",
          "Alimentarium is housed in the former headquarters of the Nestl\u00e9 Group and the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, which donated the neo-classical-styled mansion and lands on the waterfront for the museum. Its location is marked by an eight-metre stainless steel fork set in the",
          "When we visited the museum was scheduled to be closed for a refit. While it was an enjoyable and interesting place to visit as a family group, some of the exhibits seemed a bit tired and grubby/worn. That said, I would be happy to visit again after it's been spruced up.",
          "I recently took one of the Alimentarium's Saturday cooking classes. I found out about their cooking classes by visiting their web site and looking for their offerings. I was the only enrolled person in the class! A new Alimentarium employee joined the class due to space",
          "It is interesting to see this big fork on the lake! I would put the knife next too that so we can enjoy seafoods!",
          "Not much thing to do in Vevey, so after/during the walk by the waterfront it is a nice spot to spend some time with a bonus for the best photo stop of Vevey Bay.",
          "If you have children or grand-children to take care while on holidays, or simply friends who visit you, this could be an excellent place to go. This is very well done, orgnaized, very interesting, educative. The place is just superb, in the old Nestle headquarters, a magnificent",
          "This museum tells about the history of food. I realized that children are ver interested. I was less. The restaurant of the Alimentarium offers a nice meal for a reasonable price. pore",
          "Very interesting and the first food museum in the world! Its placed in a beautiful setting right next to the lake Geneva. Worth a visit!",
          "The history of food presented in bite size pieces , it is also interactive which adds to the experience",
          "The Alimentarium is located along the lakeside in Vevey, where fishermen stand and throw their lines, and children on scooters whiz by or groups amble to see the latest exhibition. Now there is a good restaurant / cafe with places outside under the chestut trees, with 3 'menus",
          "its smaller than you would think but its still a nice visit. the lake right in front of it is an amazing visit and you can have a stroll there after your done",
          "We visited this museum after its renovation. It is an interesting concept that has been created with a lot of interactivity from the visitor. Fortunately the museum was not too full, so we have been able to take out time on the many displays and screens on which the vast",
          "Drove the bus there with 12 kids on board. They loved it and the staff really knew how to take them.",
          "The Alimentarium was the primary reason for my visit to Switzerland and I was not disappointed. Recently renovated in 2016, this high-tech interactive education centre was incredibly comprehensive. From the Food sector, to the Society sector to the Body Sector, the edible garden",
          "Perfect place to take kids on a rainy day for a few hours. The museum teaches you in a fun interactive way about food, digesting, the senses, setting a table etc... You can also do workshops for adults and kids parties. The only downside is unfriendly young staff at the",
          "Nice relaxing visit. A good way to spend an hour. The gardens at the back are gorgouse and all is well presented.",
          "Really cool, interactive museum with Special Features on the tour. It's a great idea when you're in Vevey and fun for the whole Family.",
          "This is not a museum in the sense that an adult does not obtain new knowledge. On the other hand it is interactive and really interesting and funny for kids. Cook workshops available. Enjoy a fresh tarte!",
          "Is not really a food museum but a analogy to food viewed trough Nestle corp. eyes.... So is better to spend your time staring at the like unless you are craving for some different experience.",
          "This is a sign of the landscape in Veve- beautiful. Do not miss. We did not go to the museum. Take Photo with a fork in every angle. Nearby is Charlie Chaplin's statue. On Saturday's ther is a nice and colorful market nearby.",
          "This BIG Fork is absolutely the landmark in Vevey, everyone can have so much fun to take many photos in different angles of the fork here.",
          "There has been an impressive job on interactivity wit lots of content available on the numerous screens. This means two things: - You will need time and opportunity to spend lots of time on the screens, which is not so easy if the museum is crowded. You may end up zapping a lot",
          "This museum is a Nestl\u00e9 sponsored museum and is all about food, food history, where food comes from and anything related to food and cooking. Kids love it. I was personally a bit disappointed. They just reopened after rebuilding the exposition and they could have been a lot more",
          "Did not have time to visit the museum but had a blast taking some snaps with the Fork. Nice piece of innovative art.",
          "I visited the museum with a group of friends. Some of the exhibits are interesting, however, the quality is not unified. It might fit a group of kids, however, I suspect adults will not find is suitable.",
          "The museum was not open when we visited last April but we did not miss the chance to take our picture with THE FORK! What a fun installment! We had some time to wait for our lunch and so we sat lakeside and watched people sit on the chairs that are installed on the rocks and",
          "It didn't cost anything and we had a blast taking picture after picture of us and the folk doing crazy things. Met a family from Morroco who were doing likewise. So we took pictures of them, and they us. Nice cultural exchange.",

          "Museum presents food in all its aspects, not only as a culinary delight. It is interactive, with lot of touch screens and learning games. Very informative and fun, personally, I liked best the part that describes how our body processes food and how our senses react to food.",
          "The Alimentarium re-opened in June 2016 after almost a year of renovations and is now a far more interesting and inter-active place to visit. It is also very \"high tech\" in that there are loads of touch screens, wall screens etc that explain everything to do with food. (Food",
          "For over 30 years already , the Alimentarium has been sharing a global and independent view of the many aspects of the human diet. Workshops for children & adults !",
          "In the lake, the Fork is there outstanding. You can take a break in front of it. Very pretty lake and small town. You will love it.",

          "We were just passing by this lovely building on the promenade in Vevey and thought we would have a look inside! Another fun, well presented Swiss museum, this one all about food. Very interactive and once again, we learned a lot about food! Our 13-year old was thoroughly",
          "It is nice place to visit for everybody. Fresh air, giant lake with high mountains and cloud around. You should go there at the weekend and relax to refresh your mind!",
          "We came upon this sculpture while walking along the waterfront in Vevey. It is a short walk away from the Charlie Chaplin statue.",
          "If you happen to be walking around the old part of Vevey and the lake promenade, then this remarkable newly renovated building is worth a visit. It\u2019s all about food from the beginning of mankind to present junk food and eating habits. Should be very interesting to children and",
          "Even it can be difficult to imagine a musem based on food, this museum worth a visit. Kids have lots of interactive spaces where to learn about food and health.",
          "Lunch and business meeting at the Alimentarium. There is only one menu choice in the restaurant which was packed with healthy vegetables, but a little spicy. Most of the adults were happy with the dish but none of the children found it appealing or appetising - they had to",
          "My children & family have been coming to the Alimentarium for 5 years now and it has always been one of their favourite museums in the area. In fact, most vacations my son insists on visiting it 4 or 5 times. Last year it was closed for renovations, and we were very much",
          "very nice.. very interesting and informative the food museum itself okay and quite a lot of new things you'll never guess from your daily food",
          "A funny mixture of nutritional science and entertainment. There are also interactive expositions where one need to move some objects that can be also fun for little kids, we also liked presentation about tees which took place in a very nice hall. Next visit is planned for there",
          "You will not miss a Big Fork of 26 foot (8 meter), located opposite the Musee de l\u2019Alimentation museum as you walk along the lake in Vevey. Its is just a few meters from the Chaplin statue as well. The fork is an installation to mark the 10th anniversary of the museum and is",
          "We went on the re-opening weekend in June. Overall, the experience was good, and you could probably finish in a couple of hours. If you have kids, the junior academy in the lower level looks like fun. We didn't have enough time to take our kids there unfortunately. The",
          "As a symbol of the Alimentarium Food Museum and regarding food culture this is a really interesting monument which is surrounded by the extremely beautiful mountains and the lake Leman. Also could be made a reference to the monument of Charles Chaplin which is next to this one.",
          "I had been here a year before. It now looked so different and new. This is a Nestle Company facility, extremely well decorated, and different very unique exhibitions. There are amazing lessons in nutrition , a commercial restaurant , and a beautiful kitchen garden with different",
          "This fork is a work of art to mark an anniversary of some kind of the vevey food museum. I was told this controversial piece was removed by the town council and then placed back. Now its an icon of Vevey. I feel it adds to beauty of the lake and very different indeed.",
          "have time on your hand as thereare so many interactivities that you could easily devote half a day. Must try the food served in the cafe! The only meal available then is vegetarian pasta.",
          "Beautiful walk by the lake with lots to look at! One of the most iconic symbols of Vevey. Many tourists love this attraction!",
          "Good museum. If you are a museum lover then you should be here. It's not a must but kind of nice to visit if you are at Vevey.",
          "This is the museum where nestle is explaining all about food... History and associated topical located right on the lake front! The museum also offers theme specific exhibitions that change from time to time.",
          "Many interesting facts around food and human interactions with scents and tastes. Was a great sensorial adventure for kids and adults. Highly recommended.",
          "Is so great visit this museum cause u will see how our meals are evaluated from mny years.... U can also learn cooking and take a tea in the museum. is wonderful for adults and kids.",
          "Fantastic location with great view over lac Leman. Good for family visits. Great temporary exhibitions. Regular cooking master classes for kids and adults-available in either French or English.",
          "You must read reviews carefully, as the museum is getting a major facelift and is closed for 9 months until June 2016. If you look at reviews of this museum, be sure to check the date they VISITED, not when they reviewed the museum. Otherwise you might think that it is open",
          "Good rainy day option. A balance of information, education and fun. Exhibitions changes from time to times. Food is available inside of the museum or the bistros around it. The only museum big enough to be a reason to get out of bed in rainy day within the region.",
          "A unique food museum with interesting interactive exhibits. If you can speak French, there is a cooking class that you can sign up.",
          "Should see this museum if you are visiting VEVEY, Every thing is clear and in detailed to help every one to understand how they produce their products.",
          "The museum is fascinating, and the food workshop are well done, and you get to take what you prepared home! How cool is that! After the visit you have to go to visit the city of Vevey, which is beautiful!",
          "If you like food and want to know the back story on cookware, culinary techniques, history of consumption etc... then this place is for you! There are several interactive exhibits to keep kids and less interested parties engaged. They have a caf\u00e9 where they have been",
          "I don't think that this establishment deserves to be 2nd place in Tripadvisor for things to do in Vevey. It is expensive at 12 CHF entrance fee. It is very basic and does not live up to the blurb. It's all about Nestle really and they only pay lip service to putting things in",
          "Go there. You will find interesting museum, nice thematic foods and the possibility to cook yourself, under a cook supervision.",
          "A waste of 12chf. It was very uninspiring. And boring. I was expecting more interactivity around food. Food cannot be this boring. Just a lot of nutritional info. Basic info about cooking over history. Stuff that u already know.",
          "Awesome place to visit. I celebrate my daughter birthday party over there. Nice planning and kids enjoyed a lot. Thanks to all staffs.",
          "Interesting, informative, well laid out. An unexpected different kind of museum. Great for kids, interesting for adults.",
          "We have visited this museum several times, initially with our children who enjoyed the interative displays, and more recently by ourselves. We find there is still plenty for us to learn. It is spread over several floors of an old house and one can get lovely lake views from",
          "This place is just a few steps walk from where I staying in May1,2015. It's a must place to come over and took some pictures. Why? Because it's unique :D",
          "This was a very interesting museum with a lot of interesting and fun facts about food history and nutrition. It appeals to a wide age group with something for everyone, A good way to spend a casual afternoon. The gardens were just as interesting as the inside.",
          "In a town not overflowing with tourist attractions, the Food Museum in Vevey is an interesting enough way to spend a few hours. The bottom floor is about food history generally and includes some interesting artifacts. Upstairs it becomes the Nestle museum for a floor, including",
          "We enjoyed very much the visit. The guide was a very nice lady that explained facts about nutrition and stories about food culture. The museum is extremely nice set, and well decorated, in front of the lake.",
          "This restaurant is part of the Alimentarium food museum and is located is a very light Veranda on the back part of the building. Menus are limited but based on thematic so always with some original combinations",
          "It's a fairly large building, divided according to the individual sections. It is very nicely furnished and interactively. We came less than 60 minutes before closing time, because we had no idea how big the museum is. The lady at the ticket office told us that this time is",
          "The little shop downstairs has some really lovely gifts and kitchen ware for sale. The place is light and airy and its great if you have guests visiting as a local attraction",
          "Sight seeing with friends, loved seeing Charlie and the fork. Took a walk down to the castle as well :) a nice trip out !!!!:)",
          "If you have time on your hands and want to be more informed about food, this is a good place to go. Quite varied in the type of exhibits, it has something for people of all ages. Some machines give out chocolates for you to taste :)",
          "If you know anything at all about food, you will learn absolutely nothing at this museum. It is really just an advertisement for Nestl\u00e9 (which is headquartered nearby). And not even a very good advertisement (Nestl\u00e9 really should be ashamed - this is not a positive promotion",

A municipality, it is situated on the shores of Lake L\u00e9man (French: Le/Lac L\u00e9man). It faces the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located 62 kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva.\nThe municipality Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, and foreign parts) was over 1.2 million inhabitants in 2000.Lausanne is a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called Lousanna, at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called Lausodunon or Lousodunon (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as vikanor[um] Lousonnensium and in 280 as lacu Lausonio. By 400, it was civitas Lausanna, and in 990 it was mentioned as Losanna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. Then it came under Bern from 1536 to 1798, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the Cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton, Vaud, under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\n\n\n=== Modern history and heritage ===\n\nIn 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial district of Renens and transforming the local diet.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2014 have \"sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby\".The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about 500 metres (1,640 ft) between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, visitors should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street which they are trying to negotiate. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet (871 m (2,858 ft)) as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2009, of 41.38\u201341.33 square kilometers (15.98\u201315.96 sq mi) (depending on calculation method). Of this area, 6.64 km2 (2.56 sq mi) or 16.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 16.18 km2 (6.25 sq mi) or 39.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 18.45 km2 (7.12 sq mi) or 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.05 km2 (12 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.0% is unproductive land.Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 21.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.5%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 11.1% is used for growing crops and 4.2% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.The municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,153 mm (45.4 in) of precipitation.

          "We loved the setting and the staff on the transports -other than the Minifunic- were lovely. This is what happened on the Minifunic. Judge for yourselves... We have two children with autism and a also one with a visual impairment. We must accompany them in unfamiliar",
          "This place is now called Verticalp Emosson. Funicular, train and minifunic, well coordinated, take you up to the Emosson dam where there's a restaurant, views of Mont Blanc and the Trient glacier, walks, dinosaur trail, a chapel with nice stained-glass windows depicting alpine",
          "Great day out. Enjoyed the funicular and the train. Restaurant at the dam was excellent and portions were generous. Staff were very helpful with wheelchair. Couldn't recommend highly enough. Glad we picked this trip rather than Brevent. The scenery was stunning, especially as",
          "Another fabulous day spent in the Alps. Easily accessible by train, the welcome station is just round the corner. 3 different modes of transport to get up, first funicular is the steepest in Switzerland, totally mind blowing, when you get to the top you then hop on a little",
          "We couldn\u2019t go to the top of the Midi so were looking for something else and found this gem just over the boarder. It wasn\u2019t very clearly advertised or signposted that well as we\u2019d driven past a few times on this and previous visits. But so worth a visit! Parking in season is",
          "By taking the train from Chamonix station you can reach Finhaut and the Emosson resorvoir. From the train station you take the first cable car up, and from there a small train. Then the next step is another lift up. From here i suggest you go to Cabane du Vieux-Emosson. Here you",
          "The 3 different transports The view of the Alps The dam and the technical installations in place and under construction Come and see!!!",
          "We used these three ways to go up to the Emosson Lake to hike before returning. The first part is fun, as really tilted. Then there is that little train, by the mountain. The view was breathtaking! Then that little funi to get up. Great fun. All together much more interesting",
          "Great time seeing the dramatic emossen dam. You start on a funicular, then get on a little train, then another funicular. You can then walk along the dam itself. Great views from the dam and the train. We were staying in Chamonix, France and it was an easy train ride to",
          "We went up with our family with two teenage doughters of 14 and 16 and we loved it. Sometimes it was quite terrifying to get up on the steep mountains but, hey, just relax! The views when you arrive let you forget everything. They are great! You should not miss this trip when",
          "Everything is perfect & magic ! A very nice experience, the little train, the view, good fondue after a nice walk up in the mountains ! I took my family visiting Switzerland from Mexico and USA we all love it !",
          "Wow. You really have to do this. The most beautiful place and very fun for both child and adult to go there Witt three different kind of \"trains\". You have the most beautiful view to Mont Blanc and you can go hiking for long trips up there. We had never heard about this",
          "This is for sure the best attraction for children in swiss and around. You getting montain lake by 3 types of transportation including amazing train with views to Alps. The trip around the lake is very nice and kids played with snow in the middle of July.",
          "Now this is something everyone should visit at least once in a lifetime. Beautiful landscapes, breathtaking views. The funiculaire is just amazing, the little train, is funny perfection... Unbelievable...",
          "Wow. Great place to cure your sickness of hedge. First come in morning or beginning of afternoon. They close at 525pm. \u20ac36 each you travel on 3 sections and in tiny mines train like at Disneyland hahahaha. Great sense of fear and astonished views of Mont Blanc montagnes.",
          "Another very funny way to go to the second largest barrier lake in Switzerland. Once on top you can also visit the finding spot of dinosaurs traces (attention: 2.5 h of walk one way). Definitely worth a trip.",
          "I was looking for a cable car ride, but this was so much more. You arrive at a powerstation at the base of a hill. Well the base of the hill is still wayyy up the mountain. This is the start point for the adventure, 2 hours minimum, but you can make it longer for sure. From",
          "Although I am little wary of heights, this experience was very much worth it, the 3 stage journey to the first dam and lake is stunning. Add an hour or so and you can walk to the higher/ smaller lake. Nice cafes at 3 locations, The views including great ones of Mont Blanc alone",
          "Went here with family. The dam is really impressive, the walk across it is spectacular, gives you a great sense of the scale of the dam. Afterwards we had fondue in the restaurant at the top. A lovely setting for a restaurant. You can walk to a smaller reservoir where you can",
          "The dam is compelling but the journey up is epic. Worth the money just for the 3 train combo. Joyous",
          "Very nice and funny 3 different cable car and train to reach the dam Fantastic view on the Alps At destination, different hiking paths Nice dam and lake A Very god attraction at least 3/4 hours",
          "Looked like something fun to do whilst in the area. We weren't disappointed. 3 different rides up to the top of the dam. Girls really enjoyed it as did the wife and I. Views were amazing. At the top we had a lovely walk across the dam and continued around the lake for about a",
          "I went with my family by car from Evian. The trip took 1 hour and 40 minutes. We found a car park near the funicular which wasn't crowded. We got a 20% family discount for the ticket both ways. The place is well maintained and clean. The person at the ticket window speaks good",
          "We started our excursion at the Ch\u00e2telard (1125m) by riding the funicular with its impressive 87% slope to reach the Montuires (1825m) where we took the mini train to the minifunic that brought us up to the Emosson dam (1965m). All working there were extremely welcoming and",
          "This is a very nice way to spend a hot a sunny day. The temperatures are pleasant due to the height and you can spend the morning and afternoon! I went with my husband by car from Geneva. It takes almost 2 hours by car through Switzerland. There is also a way through France that",
          "We've spent many years exploring Chamonix, but never managed to get here - I wish we had come sooner. The views are fantastic - across the Mont Blanc Massif and the valley below. The construction of the dam itself is also very impressive. We went when the lake was very low so",
          "It is sbsolutely incredible and exceptional site to visit. The combination of a typical village , train , funicular , lift wagon ...all at close to 90 degrees angle is unic experience . The landscapes, view and nature is sbsolutely out of standard. The hikers can enjoy an out of",
          "Scenic and full of natural beauty. Best seasons for visit are summers. We made a road trip from belgium...it was tiring but totally worth it..!!",
          "We have done a few different trains/funiculars/cable cars in the region and decided to do the VerticAlps trip kind of last minute as I hadn\u2019t heard too much about it (it certainly doesn\u2019t get mentioned on TA as much as the various lifts in the Chamonix area) We didn\u2019t know what",
          "Worth the expense to travel on the world's steepest funicular, small train and, finally, the mini funicular up to the Emosson Dam. Incredible views, over valleys and Alps, all the way to the top. Once at the top there are walks and hikes for the more adventurous and restaurants",
          "A great day out for all ages - but not cheap unless, like us, you have some sort of Travel Card which gets you a discount. As \"oldies\" all we did was ride up the three stages to the top of the second funicular, have a beer, take a few photos, and ride down again but we",
          "We went from Martigny on the Mont Blanc Express - an interesting ride in itself, which goes up the mountain and you see amazing scenery enroute. When we got up to Le Chatelard VS we bought the tickets for the 3 railways - 40SF per adult return, though we used our half fare",
          "Had a fab time, the landscape is breathtaking \ud83d\ude0a recommend it definitely! Try and go on a clear sunny day and the experience will be 100 times better",
          "VerticAlp Emosson is the new name for what used to be called \"le Parc d'Attractions du Ch\u00e2telard\". In 2013 the old funicular was demolished and a new one installed in its place. The new one meets all current safety etc. regulations. The first funicular goes from near the",
          "We travelled by train to starting point to find that this is shut - had checked le Chatelard.net before we went and had seen no mention of this so wasted our money. I emailed le chatelard.net to complain and was directed to the news page, where it is mentioned, and told rudely",
          "We did a family trip (kids: 7 and 8 years) to this \"parc\". It's not really a \"parc d'attraction\" (not like a six flag) but a nice dam visit with a fantastic view on the alps and mont blanc mountains. There are 2 funiculars (very steep) and 1 train to take to go up, one way is",
          "I travelled to Parc d\u2019attractions Chatelard as part of a tour organised by Treyn Holidays. We got to Le Ch\u00e2telard on the last day of operation before closure for the winter. The park (alt. 1120 m) is situated 23 km from Martigny via the Forclaz Pass and 19 km from Chamonix via"

He founded and was vice president of the Salon des Tuileries.Many works by Bourdelle can be seen in the Mus\u00e9e Bourdelle- Buste de Beethoven, Adam, Le b\u00e9lier r\u00e9tif, Centaure mourant, La Libert\u00e9 and Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant. From 1922 to 1923 he worked on La Vierge \u00e0 l\u2019offrande and completed the maquette for La France. He also completed La Naissance d\u2019Aphrodite for the Marseille Opera House. In 1925 he exhibited at the Exposition internationale des Arts d\u00e9coratifs showing Sappho, Le Livre and Masque de Bourdelle in the Pavillon du livre.  1926 finally saw his Alv\u00e9ar monument inaugurated after 10 years of work and a version of La France was exhibited at the Salon des Tuileries. 1928 saw a retrospective exhibition to celebrate the inauguration of the Brussels Palais des Beaux-Arts and 1929, the year of his death, saw the Monument to Adam Mickiewicz inaugurated. Bourdelle died on the 1 October 1929 at V\u00e9sinet whilst a guest of the founder Rudier. In 1931 there was a great retrospective of Bourdelle's work at the Paris Orangerie.  He is buried in Montparnasse cemetery. In 1924 he had been made Commandeur de l'Ordre de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\n\n== War memorials ==\nApart from the war memorials mentioned above Bourdelle also worked on a \"Monument aux D\u00e9put\u00e9s morts pour La France\", a memorial honouring the Deputies who had died in the 1914\u201318 war. He was keen on placing the memorial in the central niche of the Salle du Roi in the Palais Bourbon, a room dominated by Delacroix' paintings and designed the memorial so as not to clash with these works. The female figure in the statue, said to be based on Isadora Duncan, held a huge short sword and held aloft a round shell of the type carried by Greek hoplites. The piece was called \"La Victoir du Droit\". Bourdelle completed the maquette, the intention being that the final marble statue would be 3.25m high. Sadly the project was not pursued by the French State.\nBourdelle's 1922/23 La Vierge \u00e0 l'Offrande or Vierge \u00e0 l'Enfant in grey chauvigny limestone at Niederbruck, although not an actual war memorial, was directly linked to the 1914\u201318 war. L\u00e9on Vogt, a pupil of Bourdelle, owned potash mines in Alsace and in 1914 his mother vowed that if the family property was kept from destruction during the war she would commission a statue to celebrate this. She died during the war but after the war, L\u00e9on commissioned Bourdelle to execute a suitable statue. Bourdelle completed various studies and the second study, enlarged to 2.5m, was placed in the crypt at Hartmannswillerkopf. The same study but now 6m high was placed on the slope of the wooded hill above Niederbruck in the Manavaux valley to fulfil Mme Voigt's vow. The work was exhibited in the \"Section d'Art Religieux\" at the Salon d'Automne\" of 1921\u201322. In Bourdelle's work the baby Jesus is held above her shoulder by the Virgin Mary, His arms are outstretched so his body takes on the form of a Cross. The inscription on the statue also gives thanks for Alsace-Lorraine's return to France after the war. \"En reconnaissance de la protection divine sur la vall\u00e9e de Masevaux et du retour de l\u2019Alsace-Lorraine \u00e0 la France les \u00e9poux Joseph Vogt 1914\u20131918\"\n\n\n== Images of Bourdelle's war memorials ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Busts by Bourdelle ==\nLouis Gillet wrote \"..no one has made more beautiful busts than those of Koeberle, Anatole France, M. Simu, Auguste Perret and Sir James Fraser\"Here are details of some of these busts, including the acclaimed studies of Beethoven which occupied Bourdelle over a long period of time. Bourdelle often submitted portrait busts to the Salons in the hope of attracting commissions.  The bust \"Adam\" was submitted to the Salon des Artists Fran\u00e7ais in 1888 and he had submitted his bust of Armand Saintis in 1884, Delard in 1885, the actor \"Marais\" in 1886 and \"La Marquise Silvia de Mari\" and \"St Merlatti\" in 1887.\n\n\n== Cathedrals and churches ==\nIn 1916 Bourdelle also created a small votive depicting St Barbe which is held by the Lyon Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts. Bourdelle was asked to create the votive by the family of his brother-in-law, Dr Couchoud, as protection for their son who was away fighting in the artillery. Originally it was placed in the church of St Julien de l'Herm near Lyon before being transferred to the museum. The piece is in polychromed cement. There are copies of the work located in Stockholm, Rome, Bruxelles and Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Works in Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay ==\n\n\n== Main works ==\n\n\n== Images of Mickievicz monument, including bas-reliefs ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Main works (continued) ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sculptures by Antoine Bourdelle at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Good museum. If you are a museum lover then you should be here. It's not a must but kind of nice to visit if you are at Vevey.",
          "This is the museum where nestle is explaining all about food... History and associated topical located right on the lake front! The museum also offers theme specific exhibitions that change from time to time.",
          "Many interesting facts around food and human interactions with scents and tastes. Was a great sensorial adventure for kids and adults. Highly recommended.",
          "Is so great visit this museum cause u will see how our meals are evaluated from mny years.... U can also learn cooking and take a tea in the museum. is wonderful for adults and kids.",
          "Fantastic location with great view over lac Leman. Good for family visits. Great temporary exhibitions. Regular cooking master classes for kids and adults-available in either French or English.",
          "You must read reviews carefully, as the museum is getting a major facelift and is closed for 9 months until June 2016. If you look at reviews of this museum, be sure to check the date they VISITED, not when they reviewed the museum. Otherwise you might think that it is open",
          "Good rainy day option. A balance of information, education and fun. Exhibitions changes from time to times. Food is available inside of the museum or the bistros around it. The only museum big enough to be a reason to get out of bed in rainy day within the region.",
          "A unique food museum with interesting interactive exhibits. If you can speak French, there is a cooking class that you can sign up.",
          "Should see this museum if you are visiting VEVEY, Every thing is clear and in detailed to help every one to understand how they produce their products.",

          "I don't think that this establishment deserves to be 2nd place in Tripadvisor for things to do in Vevey. It is expensive at 12 CHF entrance fee. It is very basic and does not live up to the blurb. It's all about Nestle really and they only pay lip service to putting things in",
          "Go there. You will find interesting museum, nice thematic foods and the possibility to cook yourself, under a cook supervision.",
          "A waste of 12chf. It was very uninspiring. And boring. I was expecting more interactivity around food. Food cannot be this boring. Just a lot of nutritional info. Basic info about cooking over history. Stuff that u already know.",
          "Awesome place to visit. I celebrate my daughter birthday party over there. Nice planning and kids enjoyed a lot. Thanks to all staffs.",
          "Interesting, informative, well laid out. An unexpected different kind of museum. Great for kids, interesting for adults.",
          "We have visited this museum several times, initially with our children who enjoyed the interative displays, and more recently by ourselves. We find there is still plenty for us to learn. It is spread over several floors of an old house and one can get lovely lake views from",

          "This restaurant is part of the Alimentarium food museum and is located is a very light Veranda on the back part of the building. Menus are limited but based on thematic so always with some original combinations",
          "It's a fairly large building, divided according to the individual sections. It is very nicely furnished and interactively. We came less than 60 minutes before closing time, because we had no idea how big the museum is. The lady at the ticket office told us that this time is",
          "The little shop downstairs has some really lovely gifts and kitchen ware for sale. The place is light and airy and its great if you have guests visiting as a local attraction",

          "If you have time on your hands and want to be more informed about food, this is a good place to go. Quite varied in the type of exhibits, it has something for people of all ages. Some machines give out chocolates for you to taste :)",
          "If you know anything at all about food, you will learn absolutely nothing at this museum. It is really just an advertisement for Nestl\u00e9 (which is headquartered nearby). And not even a very good advertisement (Nestl\u00e9 really should be ashamed - this is not a positive promotion",
          "We have visited this museum several times. Our children when younger enjoyed the interactive exhibits. These days we enjoy the various displays and the exhibitions which change every few months but we also have a go on some of the interactive exhibits ourselves. The museum has",
          "Unless you're working on your thesis on food, you might find this a little dull. We took the audio guide, but stopped listening to it after 15 minutes. It had some interesting information, but it was too boring to have to listen to all of it to glean the interesting info. I",
          "I got the feeling that Food is just an excuse to advertise Nestl\u00e9 company. It was raining and we where with a couple of friends with a son who's 1 year old. As it was lunch time for the baby, we went to the restaurant (self service) of the museum to get 4 drinks and sit on a",

          "There's a changing temporary exhibition and also permanent exhibition, all based on food: history, nutrition, trade, etc. Many aspects of the museum are geared towards children with interactive points and workshops. Many school come her. True, it is run by the local food",
          "The Alimentarium is a museum about all aspects of food as consumption. Simple but convincing exhibits about packaging, changing consumption patterns, food production. One hour workshops in a fully equipped kitchen under the guidance of a real chef. Children until 12 are welcome",
          "A giant stainless steel fork is stuck in the lake. Just behind is the Museum. If you have the Swiss Rail Pass, there's no entrance fee and it's worth a quick look. We had lunch outside on the picnic tables and just sit by the lake and enjoyed the view of the fork with the Swiss",
          "We went here in January 2014 and were very disappointed. You are charged for entrance into what is really a promotion for Nestle products and a very poor one at that. Very boring museum with very little in it and terrible effort on the part of Nestle! At the very least you",
          "The museum was a positive experience, with things to do for both children and adults. The interactive part, where you for example could taste and smell different things, was really nice. And the more educational parts of the exhibition were also interesting and well made.",
          "An interesting visit, interactive, you have the possibilities to make some small test,( like smelling perfumes and guess what smell it is ) some of the special exhibitions are very interesting,but the whole could be more original and surprising...",
          "The education on the benefits of eating well and sticking to the food pyramid are good. It is really geared for children. Some history of food is included. Cafe is open for only an hour and a half--disappointing.",
          "First impressions are so important, and yet the reception at this museum leaves a bad memory as you enter the museum. Employees who can barely take the time to greet you, and who give the impression that they are not happy, and come across as rude. The museum itself is well",

          "This Museum is nice and interesting for kids meanly. All explanation are written in 3 languages, French, German, English It covers many aspects about food, detailed and easy to understand. The exhibition is done very well. It is a special and cute museum, suitable for kids.",
          "The garden surrounding the building and the planters throughout had a wonderful selection of fresh vegetables and herbs. The exhibition on nutrition was interesting and the fresh cakes were really nice.",
          "It was already almost 13 years ago that I was in Vevey, but this time it was the first time I visited this Food Museum. It was quite impressive and good to learn again, although the price was indeed quite high, but it was Switzerland :-)",
          "Visited the Alimentarium last week. Was OK overall with some interesting aspects, but in my opinion it's overpriced at CHF12 per adult. Some interesting elements (test kitchen and veggie/herb garden in front), but many of interactive exhibits were out of order and the whole",

          "This is an interesting museum with a lot of history of food, but it's getting quite dated. The museum does offer an interactive part that is very good for the kids. I understand they are revamping the entire museum, so perhaps it will be better when they reopen.",
          "The Museum is really interesting, showing many aspects about food, detailed and easy to understand. The building is owned by the Nestl\u00e9 company and was used at earlier times as their headquarter. Currently still some courses and representative cvents are held by Nestl\u00e9. The",

          "I'm not a lover of museums...but when interactivity plays with history, this is where you can find me! The Alimentarium is definitely a different \"museum (I don't like call it a museum)\". A place where you can learn, share and enjoy elements which are linked to our everyday",

          "Fun visit on the beautiful lake side in Vevey. If the weather does not entice you to stay outside and profit from the gorgeous waterfront you can drop by the museum, a nice and informative visit. The cooking classes are fun for kids but I think you have to sign up in advance.",

        "wiki": "Lake Geneva (French: lac L\u00e9man [lak lem\u0251\u0303] or le L\u00e9man [l\u0259 lem\u0251\u0303], rarely lac de Gen\u00e8ve [lak d\u0259 \u0292(\u0259)n\u025bv]; German: Genfersee [\u02c8\u0261\u025bnf\u0259r\u02ccze\u02d0]) is a lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France. It is one of the largest lakes in Western Europe and the largest on the course of the Rh\u00f4ne. Of it 59.53% (345.31 km2 or 133.32 sq mi) comes under the jurisdiction of Switzerland (cantons of Vaud, Geneva, and Valais), and 40.47% (234.71 km2 or 90.62 sq mi) under France (department of Haute-Savoie).\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe first recorded name of the lake is Lacus Lemannus, dating from Roman times; Lemannus comes from Ancient Greek Lim\u00e9nos L\u00edmn\u0113 (\u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7) meaning \"port's lake\"; it became Lacus Lausonius, although this name was also used for a town or district on the lake, Lacus Losanetes, and then the Lac de Lausanne in the Middle Ages. Following the rise of Geneva it became Lac de Gen\u00e8ve (translated into English as Lake of Geneva), but Lac L\u00e9man was the common name on all local maps and is the customary name in the French language. In contemporary English, the name Lake Geneva has become predominant.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLake Geneva is divided into three parts because of its different types of formation (sedimentation, tectonic folding, glacial erosion):\nHaut Lac (Upper Lake), the eastern part from the Rh\u00f4ne estuary to the line of Meillerie\u2013Rivaz\nGrand Lac (Large Lake), the largest and deepest basin with the lake's largest width\nPetit Lac (Small Lake), the most south-west, narrower and less deep part from Yvoire\u2013Promenthoux next Prangins to the exit in GenevaAccording to the Swiss Federal Office of Topography, Swisstopo, Lac de Gen\u00e8ve designates that part of the Petit Lac, which lies within the cantonal borders of Geneva (excluding the cantonal exclave C\u00e9ligny), so about from Versoix\u2013Hermance to the Rh\u00f4ne outflow in Geneva.\n\nThe Chablais Alps border is its southern shore, the western Bernese Alps lie over its eastern side. The high summits of Grand Combin and Mont Blanc are visible from some places. Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Navigation sur le lac L\u00e9man (CGN) operates boats on the lake.\nThe lake lies on the course of the Rh\u00f4ne. The river has its source at the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier near the Grimsel Pass to the east of the lake and flows down through the canton of Valais, entering the lake between Villeneuve and Le Bouveret, before flowing slowly towards its egress at Geneva. Other tributaries are La Dranse, L'Aubonne, La Morges, La Venoge, La Vuach\u00e8re, and La Veveyse.\n\nLake Geneva is the largest body of water in Switzerland, and greatly exceeds in size all others that are connected with the main valleys of the Alps. It is in the shape of a crescent, with the horns pointing south, the northern shore being 95 km (59 mi), the southern shore 72 km (45 mi) in length. The crescent form was more regular in a recent geological period, when the lake extended to Bex, about 18 km (11 mi) south of Villeneuve. The detritus of the Rh\u00f4ne has filled up this portion of the bed of the lake, and it appears that within the historical period the waters extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) beyond the present eastern margin of the lake. The greatest depth of the lake, in the broad portion between \u00c9vian-les-Bains and Lausanne, where it is just 13 km (8.1 mi) in width, has been measured as 310 m (1,020 ft), putting the bottom of the lake at 62 m (203 ft) above sea level. The lake's surface is the lowest point of the cantons of Valais and Vaud. The culminating point of the lake's drainage basin is Monte Rosa at 4,634 metres above sea level.\n\nThe beauty of the shores of the lake and of the sites of many of the places near its banks has long been celebrated. However, it is only from the eastern end of the lake, between Vevey and Villeneuve, that the scenery assumes an Alpine character. On the south side the mountains of Savoy and Valais are for the most part rugged and sombre, while those of the northern shore fall in gentle vine-covered slopes, thickly set with villages and castles.The snowy peaks of the Mont Blanc are shut out from the western end of the lake by the Voirons mountain, and from its eastern end by the bolder summits of the Grammont, Cornettes de Bise and Dent d'Oche, but are seen from Geneva, and between Nyon and Morges. From Vevey to Bex, where the lake originally extended, the shores are enclosed by comparatively high and bold mountains, and the vista terminates in the grand portal of the defile of St. Maurice, cleft to a depth of nearly 2,700 m (8,900 ft) between the opposite peaks of the Dents du Midi and the Dent de Morcles.The shore between Nyon and Lausanne is called La C\u00f4te because it is flatter. Between Lausanne and Vevey it is called Lavaux and is famous for its hilly vineyards.The average surface elevation of 372 m (1,220 ft) above sea level is controlled by the Seujet Dam in Geneva.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDue to climate change, the average temperature of deep water (more than 300 metres or 980 feet deep) increased from 4.4 \u00b0C (39.9 \u00b0F) in 1963 to 5.5 \u00b0C (41.9 \u00b0F) in 2016 (an increase of 1.1 \u00b0C or 2.0 \u00b0F in 53 years), while the average temperature of surface water (five metres or 16 feet deep) increased from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in 1970 to 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F) in 2016 (up 2 \u00b0C or 3.6 \u00b0F in 46 years).\n\n\n=== Bise ===\nLake Geneva (and particularly the lakeside parts of the city of Geneva) can be affected by the cold Bise, a northeasterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter. The strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the difference in air pressure between Geneva and G\u00fcttingen in canton of Thurgau. The Bise arises when the air pressure in G\u00fcttingen is higher than in Geneva.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nIn 563, according to the writings of Gregory of Tours and Marius Aventicensis, a tsunami wave swept along the lake, destroying the fort of Tauredunum and other settlements, and causing numerous deaths in Geneva. Simulations indicate that the Tauredunum event was most likely caused by a massive landslide near the Rh\u00f4ne delta, which caused a wave eight metres (26 ft) high to reach  within 70 minutes. In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy, and, with it, was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire in 1033.\nIn the late 1960s, pollution made it dangerous to swim at some beaches of the lake; indeed, visibility under water was near zero. By the 1980s, intense environmental pollution (eutrophication) had almost wiped out all the fish. Today, pollution levels have been dramatically cut back, and it is again considered safe to swim in the lake. Major leisure activities practiced include sailing, wind surfing, boating (including water skiing and wake-boarding), rowing, scuba diving and bathing.\nA total of four submarines have plied the depths of Lake Geneva.\nIn 1964, Jacques Piccard launched a tourist-oriented submarine, the Auguste Piccard (named for his explorer father), for the Swiss National Exhibition, meant to honor the Expo 64 theme of accomplishments by Swiss engineers and industry. After operating through to 1965 in Lake Geneva, Piccard used the vessel for scientific exploration in other parts of the world. Piccard later built the F.-A. Forel, launched in Lake Geneva in 1978 and used primarily for scientific research until it was retired in 2005. In 2011, in a collaborative operation led by \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, two Mir submersibles were used for ten weeks to conduct extensive scientific research in Lake Geneva.On a scientific footnote, in 1827, Lake Geneva was the site for the first measurement of the speed of sound in (fresh) water.  French mathematician Jacques Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm and Swiss physicist Daniel Collodon used two moored boats, separated by a measured distance, as the transmit and receive platforms for the sounds of exploding gunpowder.  The loud airborne sound coupled into the lake, establishing a loud underwater sound that could be measured at a distance.  The flash of the exploding gunpowder provided the visual starting cue for the timepiece, and the underwater explosion sound striking a bell provided the finish cue.\nThe lake is rich in wildlife, especially birds: both the common buzzard and the red kite  breed  here in considerable numbers.\n\n\n== Sport events ==\nYacht racing is a popular sport, and high-performance catamarans have been developed specifically for the lake.  The design of the Alinghi 5, the defender of the 2010 America's Cup, was influenced by those racing catamarans.  The best-known event, the \"Bol d'Or\" (not to be confused with other events having the same name) runs from Geneva to the end of the lake and back.The Tour du Lac rowing event also takes place on Lake Geneva. Competitors row once around the entire lake, making this 160-kilometre (99 mi) event the longest non-stop rowing regatta in the world.\nSeveral competitions for swimmers are organised yearly like the crossing of the lake from Lausanne to Evian (13km), from Chillon Castle to Geneva (70km),  from Montreux to Clarens (1.8 km), in Geneva (1.8 km), all in summer, and the Coupe de No\u00ebl, 125m in Geneva in December.\n\n\n== Towns and villages ==\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nEdmund Ludlow, famous as one who had signed the death warrant of English King Charles I, was granted on 16 April 1662 protection in and continued to live at Vevey until his death in 1692.Mary and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron holidayed by the lake and wrote ghost stories, one of which became the basis for the novel Frankenstein. The Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sisi) was stabbed to death on the quayside in Geneva in September 1898. Vladimir Lenin rented a little \"chalet\" at the French bank, near Geneva. Actor Charlie Chaplin spent his final years and died in Vevey (there is a memorial statue of him along the promenade; his home at Corsier-sur-Vevey is now a museum of his life and career). Actors No\u00ebl Coward, James Mason, Sir Peter Ustinov, Richard Burton and Audrey Hepburn all lived in villages on the shores of or in view of the lake.  David Bowie moved to a chalet to the north of Lake Geneva in 1976, which inspired him to take up painting and informed the first stages of the \"Berlin Trilogy\". Pop singer Phil Collins lives in a home overlooking the lake.  Rock band Queen owned and operated Mountain Recording Studios (which is still in use today) in Montreux, and a statue of lead singer Freddie Mercury, who also owned a second home in Montreux, stands on the northern shore of the lake. Writer Vladimir Nabokov also took residence in Montreux, where he died in 1977. Ex-Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher lives with his family in a home overlooking the lake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLake Geneva region\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLake Geneva Region\nInternational Commission for the Protection of Lake Geneva (CIPEL)\nLake Geneva in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.",

          "I have been in Montreux many times now but still I always enjoy looking at the statue. Just beautiful standing in front of the lake.",
          "I liked the statue very much as it looked very lifelike. A very good memorial for a great music icon. Located on the promenade next to the lake in Montreux.",
          "Montreaux is amazing - there are statues, monuments and quirky/unusual works of art, but the one of Freddie looking out over the lake, is incredible. It is an exceptionally good likeness to him. Continue on towards the Casino to see the Studio Experience.",
          "This a lovely statue of Freddie, overlooking the beautiful lake and mountains. Highly recommend seeing and goi for a stroll around",
          "Overlooking the lake, on the promenade, we weren't aware of the existence of this statue. It's unmistakeably Freddie and quite evocative.",
          "If you are in Montreaux and ready for a refreshing walk go all the way on the bank and certainly will find the statue",
          "Walking the Promenade sur les Quais de Montreuxwe came across Freddy's statue. Totally unexpected. The statue is a thoughtful remembrance of Freddy. I do recommend you walk along the promenade, when you are in Montreaux.",
          "One of many interesting statues & sculptures around Montreux - worth seeing - right next to the lake.",
          "Freddy fell in love with Montreaux and for good reason. It\u2019s such a beautiful town on the shore of Lake Geneva. Queen owned Mountain Studios there for 15 years or so and recorded there as did many great musicians. This statute is a perfect tribute to Freddy!",
          "Bronze statue of Freddie Mercury on the lake front in Montreux -was not expecting that -guess there's a story why......",
          "A reminder that in 1978, Freddie Mercury fell in love with Montreux and Lake Geneva and decided to settle there.",
          "So you came to Montreux, but did not care to see the Freddy Mercury statue. I wonder why you bothered to visit in the first place.",
          "Nice statue of Freddie Mercury in the lakeside pedestrian road in Montreux. It's very strange but amazing to see a statue like that in Montreux and to know his history.",
          "It is in the centre of the Christmas Market and the view on the lake is magnificent. The statue itself is always crowded with people and flowers.",
          "A beautiful spot to honor a wonderful and talented musician. The statue is lovely and the base is adorned with fans gifts. Worth a visit\u2764\ufe0f",
          "This place is always crowded, so taking a good picture is not easy Besides, at the direction the \u201cmade it heaven\u201d album cover was made there was a new year installation in my case But whatever... it\u2019s Freddy - and this is a great part of the music, of the whole music page Try",
          "We celebrated Freddie\u2019s birthday with a visit to Montreux on his weekend celebration. There was a great atmosphere with lots of his fans dressed in Queen gear. There was lots of Queen memorabilia on sale and free stage shows performing his music.",
          "Could not find it on last visit to Montreux Was successful this time Just wanted to see it as am a great fan of Freddie",
          "We walked from our hotel along the lake to the statue. It wasn't all that far and is a beautiful walk. The statue is really cool. There were a lot of people around, swimming and just enjoying the day. The next day would have been Freddy's birthday and there was going to be a",
          "Had a short visit to Montreux but had to visit the Freddie statue. Location was excellent what a beautiful lake and view of the mountains. Not many people about so got a few photos, well worth the visit and only about 10 minute walk from the train station.",
          "In all but the early morning, people are around the statue taking photographs. It is along the flower promenade and fans leave flowers and other things on the statue.",
          "It was a warm, sunny, weekend day in Montreux, so lots of people were gathered around the statue. In addition, there was a lot of paraphernalia that fans have placed on the statue which detracts from its appeal. I took a couple pictures but would have preferred they were",
          "If you want to see a metal version of Freddie Mercury then you need to go here if you're like me it really isn't that interesting",
          "I had no idea this statue existed and just happened to walk upon it as I strolled along the lake. Freddie is a local icon and I joined many others in shooting a few photos.",
          "The statue was surrounded with many flowers and photos. He was very iconic and so is the statue. I would recomend it to visit.",
          "Statue was impressive, but smaller in stature than all the photos make it look. However, I got to get up close to it on a semi-sunny day without lots of crowds, and I even touched his cute little butt!",
          "Homage to a local. Seems Freddie had a lakeside place he lived in a lot and this statue is a homage to him. Along with other artists who made their home in and around lake Geneva. Charlie Chaplin (Vevey statue), Stravinsky (Montreux by the jazz hall) and many other in",
          "We visited Montreux, and the Freddy Mercury statue was our first priority. As a fan of Queen & their music, and having recently viewing Bohemian Rapsody, the statue had great appeal to me.",
          "It's actually a very good statue and that's rare - The location is plain odd. Freddie spent his life on stage in arenas, looking at thousands of fans and now he gazes forlornly into the water where not a soul resides. I thought the lady selling brass rubbing kits to make an",
          "Iconic pose of Freddie looking over the lake. Very busy attraction, obviously a well loved character. Only disappointment is the lack of support for a UK Freddie tribute.",
          "Speechless... I am so happy to have done this trip. I have and I will have a great memory about it. Thinking to back again!",
          "Lovely spot at the edge of the lake. The downside.... Too many people trying to take a photo. So time of the day and time of the year is important to maximise the chance to appreciate the statue and the view of the lake. And because it is one of the main tourist attractions in",
          "The statue is amazing to see and is directly in the middle of town on the waterfront. People still leave cards and flowers at the foot of the statue in his memory. Very cool to see.",
          "The statue is in a wonderful location lakeside. It is life size. The only downside is that people add things to this statue - it had a bag, some pride flags on its arms and many many notes left all around. It takes away from the symbol, in my opinion",
          "The reason I went to Montreux was to visit the statue of Freddie Mercury and visit the Queen Mountain Studio. It is a beautiful tribute to an absolute Legend, situated in a fantastic place on the shore with great views. Loved it.",
          "Stunning esculture of the great Freddy in all his splendor! It's oversighing on of the best view of the Leman lake. Nearby other places to remember one of the best of all times.",
          "Best to visit early if you want a good photo with Fred, lots of people had added their own \"bits\" so there was an unsightly yellow scarf dangling off Freddie's arm the whole weekend we were there - hopefully it has been removed now!",
          "Easy to find and a lovely visit while strolling along the lake. The work is a powerful tribute and impressive to view. Glad I was able to see it while in Montreux.",
          "Going to this statue was top of my list of things to do in Montreux and I was not disappointed. It is right on the promenade looking out over the lake. Lots of tourists of course but always someone there to take a photo for you.",
          "a statue erected in a city loved by Freddie Mercury. The statue was still full of flowers from those who remembered him and liked him.

          "Stumbled across the statue while walking along the lake front. Very cool! Was able to get some photos of just the statue. Well worth a visit if you are a Queen fan",
          "A crowded place in the middle of the day. I understand how we all loved Freddie but I'm not sure I agree with people trying to add their touch by draping boa's etc. on the statue. Visit at dusk for best photo opportunities",
          "Montreux has a beautiful waterfront with many interesting statues. I hadn\u2019t known Freddie Mercury was a resident. I can appreciate why - it\u2019s a beautiful spot on Lake Geneva.",
          "A good representation of the former Queen front man and a place visited by both fans (a pilgrimage for some) and non-rock fans alike. The setting is nice being on the shore of Lake Geneva. This is down the street from a musical monument park that should also be visited. This",
          "The statue of Freddie is an excellent tribute to a great artist. It is on the lakeside at Montreux looking out over the water. An excellent position and fine likeness. Unfortunately it is often draped in garlands and adorned with flowers and paper tributes from fans. That is a",
          "A larger than life statue in honor of Freddie Mercury. Beautiful setting on the shores of Lake Geneva.",

          "Right there on the promenade by Lake Geneva, this is a magnificent statue of the Queen legend in all his flamboyance. Too crowded with people wanting to take pics but worth a visit nevertheless. There is a fountain play nearby for children to frolic and beat the hot sun. Our",

          "The statue is very close to the lakeside and was slightly hidden with the Christmas market. We were searching for a huge statue but its actually probably lifesize. Good to see if youre a fan. Flowers etc were laid at his feet so maybe somewhat of a shrine. Good tourist",
          "We had a little fun around this statue, it's a popular little spot as the underground car park pedestrian exit is just behind it, so it's the first thing people see besides the gorgeous lake. The statue isn't huge which is great and Freddie is a bit of a legend so a perfect",
          "Not spectacular but a good image Of Freddy - don\u2019t take a photo when the lake is rough - you\u2019ll get wet",

          "A beautiful memorial of Freddie. Very large bronze statue of him, easily accessible opposite the big wheel. Difficult to get clear photographs as so many people round him wanting their photo taken. I could spend hours here sat on the steps overlooking the mountains and lake.",
          "As well as the statue of Freddy, there are many others along the shoreline. Some I knew, such as Charlie Chaplin, others I did not, but there were plaques on each",
          "I had the opportunity to see the Memorial of Freddie Mercury while there was also a concert on the street in his memory. Lively atmosphere and a full of fans that were listening to music.",

          "A really nice tribute to the king (queen?) of rock. it's quite impressive to see how many flowers bouquets are left there by fans, even after all this time. Any day you go there will be something left to him by someone. It's best enjoyed in a sunny summer day, after a walk",
          "While walking the lakeside promenade, we chanced upon the Freddy Mercury statue on the Place de la Marche. Fans leave their heartfelt tributes at the statue's base. It is in front of a small quai where fishermen drop their lines. The view is spectacular, by the way",
          "The Freddie Mercury statue was located right by Lake Geneva. It's a nice addition to this town and sits in the middle of the Xmas market. There is also a Queen studio nearby.",

          "Nice memorial that actually looks like him too! Location is great, right in the middle of the Christmas market!",
          "It\u2019s a statue of Freddie Mercury, not much more to say. It does have a passing resemblance of him which is more than can be said of some statues.",
          "Wouldn't go here especially to see this, however it is a nice statue, good likeness. The walk along lake Geneva however is lovely, beautiful and floral, many good photo opportunities, and take a trip on the boat too, and a trip on the cog railway up to Roychers de Naye.",

          "A great tribute to a true Queen legend located not too far from the town and station. It sits on the lake bank where people can enjoy a swim. It is just off the jazz square where the annual festivals happen. The statue itself is a great likeness and great to get a picture or",

          "Took some pics next to it, nice stop on the promenade.. 2 minute stop, can\u2019t say it\u2019s really an attraction, but as part of the walk- it was nice to see. Maybe the should invest in more info next to it",
          "I've already visited Freddie's Memorial when I was a kid. I still remember how my dad tried to make me realize how important this exceptional singer was and still is today. But it took me a while to see it for myself and to become a real Queen fan. When I visit the memorial",

          "When we booked our trip to Switzerland, I had no idea Freddie Mercury spent so much time in Montreux. We spent a couple of nights here as a waypoint and to tour Gruyere, and it was really nice to walk along the lake. We had seen this memorials name on the map and wanted to check",
          "Freddie stands strong in the rain. My previous visit to Montreux wasn\u2019t long after the smoke had cleared. Freddie was strong and there wasn\u2019t a Queen museum. This most recent visit Montreux sparkled and the food at the Brasserie was wonderful. Thankyou Freddie. Thankyou",
          "Beautiful statue of Freddie Mercury in a truly beautiful spot. A visit to the Casino just a two minute walk away where they have a museum of this icon is also worth a visit. Free admission. Get to stand in the spot where he made his last album, the casino used to be Freddie's",

          "This is a must see when in Montreux. Pretty well patronised as well. Well located just beside the lake and the marche. Also on the promenade thats tracks along the lake front from Clarens to Chillon (and probably further)",

          "It sits on the edge of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva), facing the lake. Many people take their photos with it. Freddie had a home on the lake in the next town over, Clarens, which is quite impressive. Too bad he didn't use his platform as someone famous in the music industry to help",
          "The iconic Freddie statue on the shore of Lake Geneva is a must visit for anyone who has an interest in Queen. There is also the Queen studio experience in the Montreux casino nearby which is free to enter.",

          "Iconic and a bit bizarre (his eyes are just a little insane looking, right?)- of course the connection of Montreux and music is just epic. Would love to visit during the festival, but imagine that has a little insanity of its own. Nice artwork along the promenade; glad to see",

          "Everyone who likes or liked Queen and visits Montreux knows that the band had a studio there and that late frontman Freddie Mercury lived in the town, so it\u2019s only appropriate that there be a memorial to him, in this case in the form of a large statue of him in trademark",

          "my husband and grandson are both drummers and really loved Freddy Mercury for his magnificent talent.",
          "To some its just a statue, to most they don't even know why its there. For me as a huge Queen Fan is was more a pilgrimage Definitely worth visiting and not only that the view of lake Geneva from there is breathtaking! Theres a car park located off the main road the the",

          "The views from the promenade are lovely but the statue itself is nothing to talk about unless you are a major fan of his.",
          "Like the man himself, the statue is larger than life. It's a good image in a grand place, near the waterfront. Don't miss it if you get to Montreux.",

          "A beautiful statue of Freddie Mercury can be seen on the edge of Lake Geneva, created by the amazing Czech sculptor Irena Sedlecka it can be found just down from the market area. It's a beautiful reminder of how special Montreux was to Freddie Mercury and to the whole Queen",
          "Having a spare day on our Swiss Travel Train pass we worked out an itinerary to use it for a day return trip to Montreux that would allow us to experience this beautiful area by Lake Geneva and take in one of the reasons we had chosen to visit this area. We made the journey on",
          "Not a big rock n roll fan, but other than it being a monument to him, not really much to it. Would not have otherwise been worth the walk",
          "This is just one of several monuments to great musicians. It is a good photo op and if you are there you should take a few minutes here. It is a part of what was a nice walk along Lake Geneva in a very nice town. I would love to be there for the Jazz Festival. I have a feeling",

          "Great statue in honour of a fabulous artist! Only trouble we had is the poor guy was covered up for protection from a wood chopping competition on the square!!!",

          "The Freddy Mercury stands out beautifully among the many art pieces along the path by Lake Geneva. The old phone booth turned into a mechanized piece of art is equally spectacular and worth a few moments.",
          "It's really nice to see this memorial in Montreux since Freddie Mercury did live here for several years. The statue itself is fine, and is recogniseably him, but it is not a work of art. But that's not the point of it anyway!",

          "I love Queen and Freddie Mercury, but surprised to see this listed as a Montreux \"attraction\". It is a statue amongst a variety of nice statues, including those of jazz greats, situated along the promenade bordering Lake Geneva. Nice to see and take a photo, but I doubt anyone",
          "Basically it is just a statue. There are plenty of statues by the promenade. The entire Montreaux waterfront is nice. To stroll along the water is a must-do when in this city. You will pass this statue.",

          "Montreux, situated on the banks of Lake Geneva is one of the most beautiful places in Switzerland. Blue skies, sharing their color with the lake, which is surrounded by snow clad mountains is a place straight our of any fairy tale..The energy from the nature is simply",
          "The statue itself, is just a Statue of course, the Legend is unforgettable. It's a nice memorial. The views from this spot are amazing, the lake, the mountains, the food, the people. Although I went to see the statue, I found myself looking around and being amazed at what was",
          "Stumbled upon this along our walk by the lake. It's a nice statue and it has some info about it, there were roses in front of it that people had left. It's in a beautiful location right next to the lake with a lot of different spots to sit and relax. However unless your a big",

          "The waterfront where the statue is located is lovely. The statue itself is fine, but it's just a statue. Enjoy the waterfront, soak up the sun, and take the 30 seconds it takes to see the statue. You're done. Now get on with your day and enjoy the beautiful promenade.",
          "Leaving the train station We left there in search of our hotel The travel app I had said it was only 12 minute walk Not so... We used the Freddie Mercury Statue as a guide Turned left on the Promanade of Flowers and 20-25 minutes later Arrived. I'm 65 now and my feet hurt We",

          "While visiting the Christmas Market, this was the added bonus. The statute of Freddie Mercury and the Queen Experience in the casino. I love his music, he was probably the best live entertainer ever. To visit the place where they made so many of their tracks is amazing. If",

          "It's on the sidewalk next to a Lake Geneva, you won't miss it! Very well portrayed sculpture of one of the most charismatic artists of the last century. It's obviously crowded next to a statue, so if you want to take a picture, you will have to wait for others to be done with",
          "Freddie Mercury has been my grown daughter's favorite vocalist since she was a teenager. So it was a reason we went to Montreux in the 25th anniversary year of his death, and very exciting for her to visit his Memorial on the shores of Lake Geneva in Montreux, So many tourists",
          "Have a listen to Bohemian Rhapsody with Freddie while gazing out over Lake Geneva. His statue is right on the waterfront at Place du Marche. If you walk east (water on your right) from Freddie, you'll come to casino Barriere on Rue de Theatre. The casino burnt down on December",
          "This statue on the promenade is a great tribute to the rock legend. It was a highlight of my trip and an easy location to find. I knit him a wristband and attached it to add a little bling and personality to his statue.",

          "For some this may just be a statue but I was fortunate to spend some time here before the crowds turned up and after they'd gone away. Many people stopped for a quick photo and walked off but if you want to spend a few minutes thinking about life then Freddie has a great spot",
          "Really wanted to see Freddies Memorial, it was just after his birthday and people had left candles, scarves etc on it. Some tourists had trampled all over the candles cars etc., no respect such a shame. I expect it would be better when there is stuff not to trample on. The ice",

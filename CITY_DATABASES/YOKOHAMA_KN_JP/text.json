        "wiki": "Yamashita Park (\u5c71\u4e0b\u516c\u5712, Yamashita K\u014den) is a public park in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan, famous for its waterfront views of the Port of Yokohama.\n\n\n== History ==\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923, by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. A Scotsman, Marshall Martin, advisor to Mayor Ariyoshi Chuichi, is credited with persuading the city government to use rubble from the Kannai commercial district to reclaim the former waterfront as a park.Yamashita Park was formally opened on March 15, 1930.\nThe park was requisitioned in 1945 during the Occupation of Japan for military housing, reverting to Japanese control in 1960.  Across the street from the park is the Hotel New Grand where General Douglas MacArthur spent his first night on his arrival in Japan on August 30, 1945.\n\n\n== Park attractions ==\nAs well as public green space with trees, flower beds, fountains and memorials, Yamashita Park is also noted as the location of:\n\nThe Hikawa Maru, a Japanese ocean liner built in 1929 for Nippon Y\u016bsen Kabushiki Kaisha (\"NYK Line\") now a museum ship.\nThe Port Service, an operator of seabuses, excursion and restaurant ships, operating from the park pier.

        "wiki": "Sankei-en (\u4e09\u6eaa\u5712, Three Creeks Garden) is a traditional Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan, which opened in 1906. Sankei-en was designed and built by Tomitaro Hara (\u539f\u5bcc\u592a\u90ce) (1868\u20131939), known by the pseudonym Sankei Hara, who was a silk trader. Almost all of its buildings are historically significant structures bought by Hara himself in locations all over the country, among them Tokyo, Kyoto, Kamakura, Gifu Prefecture, and Wakayama prefecture. Ten have been declared Important Cultural Property, and three more are Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan designated by the City of Yokohama. Badly damaged during World War II, the garden was donated in 1953 to the City of Yokohama, which entrusted it to the Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai Foundation (\u4e09\u6eaa\u5712\u4fdd\u52dd\u4f1a, Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai). Sankei-en was then restored almost to its pre-war condition.\n\n\n== Features ==\nSankei-en has a total surface of 175 thousand square meters and features ponds, streams, and undulating paths designed by Sankei Hara himself, plus many historic buildings, such as T\u014dmy\u014d-ji former three-story pagoda (\u65e7\u71c8\u660e\u5bfa\u4e09\u91cd\u5854), originally constructed in Kyoto in 1457 and relocated in 1914, and the Former Yanohara House (\u65e7\u77e2\u7b86\u539f\u5bb6\u4f4f\u5b85), originally the private residence of the Yanohara family.Work on the garden started in 1902 and ended in 1908, two years after it was opened to the public. During Hara's own lifetime, the place became an aggregation point for Meiji period artists. World War II caused great damage to the buildings. In 1953 the garden was donated by the Hara family to the City of Yokohama, which created the Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai Foundation for its repair and maintenance. The Foundation started the restoration in 1953 and, five years later, the garden was back almost to its original form and reopened to the public.The Japanese government has designated ten structures in Sankei-en as Important Cultural Properties, while three more are Tangible Cultural Properties designated by the City of Yokohama. The garden is popular for its cherry blossoms, ume blossoms, and the changing leaves in autumn.\n\n\n=== Kakush\u014dkaku ===\nNext to the entrance, the Kakush\u014dkaku (\u9db4\u7fd4\u95a3) was formerly the private residence of the Hara family. Today it can be rented by the public and used for meetings and parties. It is one of the three buildings on the premises designated as Tangible Cultural Properties by the City of Yokohama. Only during the summer, the Kakush\u014dkaku is open to the public.\n\n\n=== Sankei Memorial ===\nLocated immediately after the Kakush\u014dkaku, the Sankei Memorial (\u4e09\u6eaa\u8a18\u5ff5\u9928, Sankei Kinenkan) was built to introduce the public to the garden and its creator through exhibits, images and works of art. A Gifu Prefecture native, Hara was the eldest son of Yanaizuch\u014d village's headman. From childhood he liked and studied the fine arts, Sinology and poetry, finally beginning formal studies in 1885 in what is now Tokyo's Waseda University. After graduation, he became a teacher at the Atomi School for Girls. Born Aoki, he changed it later after marrying one of his students and being adopted by her family. He became the head of the family trading business and was very successful. After moving to Sankei-en's present location in Honmoku, he started collecting old buildings, rebuilding them in his garden. He then decided to open the garden to the public for free in 1906.\n\n\n=== Outer Garden ===\nThe Outer Garden, that is, the area next to the Main Pond, was the first part of the garden to open to the public in 1906. The buildings it contains are T\u014dmy\u014d-ji former three-storied pagoda, a tea room called Rind\u014d-an (\u6797\u6d1e\u5eb5), a tea hut called Yokobue-an (\u6a2a\u7b1b\u5eb5), T\u014dkei-ji's former butsuden (\u65e7\u6771\u6176\u5bfa\u4ecf\u6bbf, Ky\u016b-T\u014dkei-ji butsuden) and T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former hon-d\u014d (Main Hall) (\u65e7\u71c8\u660e\u5bfa\u672c\u5802, Ky\u016b-T\u014dmy\u014d-ji hon-d\u014d).T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former main hall (Important National Cultural Property) was brought here from Kyoto and is an example of Muromachi period (1336\u20131557) architecture. Bought in 1988, it was completely restored with intensive work of restoration and reconstruction that lasted five years.T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former three-storied pagoda (Important National Cultural Property) is visible from any point of the garden and is its symbol. It was moved to Sankei-en in 1914.\nT\u014dkei-ji's former butsuden (Important National Cultural Property) used to be the main hall of a Rinzai Zen temple in Kamakura. Its structure and name are typical of that sect. It was bought and moved to Sankei-en in 1907.\n\n\n==== Former Yanohara House ====\nThe Former Yanohara House (\u65e7\u77e2\u7b86\u539f\u5bb6\u4f4f\u5b85, Ky\u016b-Yanohara-ke Sh\u016btaku) (Important National Cultural Property) used to be the private home of an Edo period (1603\u20131868) wealthy family, the Yanohara. It is the only building whose interior is open to the public all year. It was brought here from Gifu Prefecture's Shirakawago, an area listed among the World Heritage sites. The house contains the original hearth, bathroom and kitchen used by the Yanohara. The second floor houses an exhibition of Japanese folk articles.\n\n\n=== Inner Garden ===\nThe Inner Garden, north of the Main Pond, was opened to the public in 1958, and was until then the Hara family's private garden. Its buildings are the Gomon Gate (\u5fa1\u9580) (Tangible Cultural Property), the Hakuun-tei (\u767d\u96f2\u90b8) (Tangible Cultural Property), the Rinshunkaku (\u81e8\u6625\u95a3), Tenzui-ji's former Jut\u014d \u014cid\u014d (\u65e7\u5929\u745e\u5bfa\u5bff\u5854\u8986\u5802, Ky\u016b-Tenzui-ji Jut\u014d \u014cid\u014d), the Shuns\u014dro (\u6625\u8349\u5eec), the Kinmokutsu (\u91d1\u6bdb\u7a9f), the Gekkaden (\u6708\u83ef\u6bbf), the Tenju-in (\u5929\u6388\u9662), the Ch\u014dsh\u016bkaku (\u8074\u79cb\u95a3), and the Renge-in. Only during the summer, the Rinshunkaku and the Hakuun-tei are open to the public.Of particular value is the Rinshunkaku (Important National Cultural Property, see photo below), formerly belonging to the Kii House of Tokugawa. It is often compared in beauty to the World famous Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. Originally the summer residence of Tokugawa Yorinobu, the first head of the Kii House, it used to stand in Iwade, Wakayama prefecture. Acquired by Hara in 1906, it was rebuilt over a period of three years between 1915 and 1917. Divided in three sections, it was decorated by famous artists Kan\u014d Tany\u016b and Kan\u014d Yasunobu. The transoms between pavilions are decorated with sculpted waves (first pavilion) and special paper containing poetry (second pavilion). The third pavilion's transom is decorated with real gagaku instruments like sh\u014d and flutes.\nThe Gekkaden (Important National Cultural Property) was built in 1603 by Ieyasu, the first of the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns within Kyoto's Fushimi Castle. It was bought in 1918 together with the Shuns\u014dro and moved to Sankei-en. Hara then connected it to a pavilion he built, the Kinmokutsu. The paintings on the room partitions are attributed to Momoyama period artist Kaih\u014d Y\u016bsh\u014d. The Gekkaden can be rented by the public.\nThe Tenju-in (Important National Cultural Property) was originally a Jiz\u014d-d\u014d in Kita-Kamakura near the great Kench\u014d-ji Zen temple and was bought in 1916. Tenju-in was Hara's Jibutsu-d\u014d (\u6301\u4ecf\u5802), the temple which enshrined his tutelary gods.Tenzui-ji's former Jut\u014d \u014ci-d\u014d (Important National Cultural Property, see image above) was built in 1591 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi as a resting place for his mother, and is one of the few extant buildings attributable with certainty to him.The construction of the Ch\u014dsh\u016bkaku (Important National Cultural Property, see photo below) is traditionally attributed to Iemitsu, third of the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns. The pavilion is open to the public in spring and in November for the traditional viewing of the autumn colors.The Shuns\u014dro (Important National Cultural Property) is a tea room believed to have been built for Oda Urakusai, brother of the more famous Oda Nobunaga. Urakusai was a well-known practitioner of the tea ceremony.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nFrom Yokohama, take the Negishi Line to Negishi.\nFrom bus stop No. 1, take any of the buses numbered 58, 99 or 101 and get off in Honmoku.\nCross the street, walk to the convenience store, turn right and walk straight to the garden (about 500 meters)\n\n\n== Other information ==\nOpening hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (entrance allowed until 16:30)\nTicket price (as of December 2017): 700 Yen\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u014czone Oshitayashiki\nKatsura Imperial Villa\nMa (negative space)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto gallery\nPamphlet in English (pdf)\n(in Japanese) Official website\nRemembering Tomitaro Hara by Satyasri Ukil\nMukul Dey's Letter from Sankeien, Yokohama\nSankeien and its Architectural Treasures",

Through trains between Shimbashi Station and K\u014dzu Station required a switchback at Yokohama Station.\nOn August 1, 1898, a line bypassing Yokohama Station was opened to avoid the switchback. Through trains stopped at Kanagawa Station or Hodogaya Station instead of Yokohama Station, and shuttle trains connected Yokohama and Hodogaya until Hiranuma Station opened near present-day Hiranumabashi Station on October 10, 1901. Hiranuma Station had no connection to public transport such as trams, so that major part of the passengers for the city continued to use trains that stopped at Yokohama Station.\n\n\n=== Second station ===\n\nOn August 15, 1915, the second Yokohama Station opened close to the present day Takashimach\u014d Station to allow T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line trains to call at Yokohama Station. The original Yokohama Station was renamed Sakuragich\u014d Station. JR East uses this date as the opening date of the current Yokohama Station.\nThe terminal of the Keihin Line (present-day Keihin-T\u014dhoku Line) had been in Takashimach\u014d since 1914 and was merged to the new station. The government-run electric line was later this year extended to Sakuragich\u014d.\nOn 1 September 1923, the station was destroyed by a fire in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake.\nSix days later, the station reopened with a temporary building.\nThe city of Yokohama and the Ministry of Railways agreed in February 1924 that the station would be relocated.On May 18, 1928, the Tokyo Yokohama Railway (now the Tokyu Toyoko Line) extended from its former terminal of Kanagawa Station was connected to the station. The extension line passed through the construction site of the new Yokohama Station of the government railways.\n\n\n=== Third station ===\n\nOn October 15, 1928, the third (current) Yokohama Station opened on the north side of the second station. The T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line also moved to its current route, which was the route of the bypass line opened in 1898. The government railways and the Toyoko Line shared the station from the beginning.\nOn February 5, 1930, the Keihin Electric Railway (now the Keikyu Main Line) was connected to the station.\nOn December 27, 1933, the Jinch\u016b Railway (now the Sotetsu Main Line) was connected to the station. On December 9, 1957, the north side underground entrance opened. On December 1, 1965, the MARS on-line ticket reservation system was introduced at the station. On September 4, 1976, the Yokohama City Subway Line No. 3 was connected to Yokohama Station. On November 7, 1980, the new east station building and east-west passage opened. On January 31, 2004, The T\u014dky\u016b T\u014dyoko Line platform reopened underground, and on February 1, 2004, the Minatomirai Line opened.\n\n\n=== Future ===\nOn August 26, 2010, JR East announced the development of a new station building to replace the current West Entrance, tentatively named the Yokohama Station West Station Building (\u6a2a\u6d5c\u99c5 \u897f\u53e3\u99c5\u30d3\u30eb, Yokohama-eki Nishiguchi-eki biru).  Scheduled to open in 2020 before the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, the development will include a 26-story retail and office building, Station-front tower (\u99c5\u524d\u68df, Ekimae-t\u014d), on the site of the current West Entrance and a nine-story building to the north-east, Tsuruya-cho tower (\u9db4\u5c4b\u753a\u68df, Tsuruyamachi-t\u014d), which will include parking and childcare facilities.\n\n\n== Passenger statistics ==\nIn fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 406,594 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the busiest JR East station in Kanagawa Prefecture and the fourth-busiest on the JR East network as a whole.The JR East passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of East Japan Railway Company stations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJR-East Yokohama Station information\nKeikyu Railway Train and Bus information\nTokyu Railway information\nYokohama Minatomirai railway information\nS\u014dtetsu Line Yokohama Station Map\nTransportation Bureau, City of Yokohama (Municipal Subway and Bus)",

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds. The elevators' speed record was surpassed by elevators of Taipei 101 (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h) in 2004.\nThe building was designed by the architecture and engineering division of Mitsubishi Estate, now Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei and Hugh Stubbins and Associates, later KlingStubbins.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Japan\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest freestanding steel structures\nList of records of Japan\nList of public observation decks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Landmark Tower official site\n Geographic data related to Yokohama Landmark Tower at OpenStreetMap",

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds. The elevators' speed record was surpassed by elevators of Taipei 101 (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h) in 2004.\nThe building was designed by the architecture and engineering division of Mitsubishi Estate, now Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei and Hugh Stubbins and Associates, later KlingStubbins.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Japan\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest freestanding steel structures\nList of records of Japan\nList of public observation decks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Landmark Tower official site\n Geographic data related to Yokohama Landmark Tower at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "The Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse (\u6a2a\u6d5c\u8d64\u30ec\u30f3\u30ac\u5009\u5eab, Yokohama Akarenga S\u014dko) is a historical building that is used as a complex that includes a shopping mall, banquet hall, and event venues. The complex, officially known as the Newport Pier Bonded Warehouse (\u65b0\u6e2f\u57e0\u982d\u4fdd\u7a0e\u5009\u5eab, Shink\u014d Fut\u014d Hozei S\u014dko), was originally used as customs buildings, and has two sections: Warehouse No.1 and No.2. It is operated by Yokohama Akarenga Co. Ltd., and located at the Port of Yokohama in Naka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Yokohama city government worked on constructing new harbour facilities, and the first reclamation work was begun in 1899. The work, completed in 1905, was followed by expansion work which ended a year later. Planned by a Japanese architect and a government official, Tsumaki Yorinaka, the current Building No. 2 was constructed in 1911, and the current Building No. 1 was erected in 1913. Both were to be used as customs houses.\n\nWhen the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake struck Yokohama, the red brick buildings were damaged, but suffered less than other buildings due to their reinforced structure with iron implanted between the bricks. Repair work continued until 1930, and after World War II, the buildings were requisitioned by the American occupation troops between 1945 and 1956. After the buildings were returned to Japan, their use decreased with the advent of containerization, and the buildings ended their role as customs houses in 1989.\nIn 1992, Yokohama city acquired jurisdiction over the buildings, and restoration work was carried out from 1994 to 1999. This work, in which the roof and structure of the buildings were strengthened, was conducted by Takenaka Corporation, a Japanese architectural company. After the inside of the buildings was renovated, they were opened as the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse on April 12, 2002.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe complex is divided into buildings No. 1 and No. 2. Both buildings are three stories high, and are 22.6 metres wide and 17.8 metres tall. The area of Building No. 1 is 5,575 m\u00b2, with a length of 76 metres, while Building No. 2 has a total area of 10,755 m\u00b2, and a length of 149 metres.Building No. 1 is regarded as a cultural facility, and is utilized as an event venue for art exhibitions, film festivals, musical competitions and plays. Building No. 2 houses a shopping mall and restaurant arcade, and a balcony from which visitors can view the harbour opened on the 3rd floor in 2007. Other sightseeing spots including Yokohama Chinatown, Minato Mirai 21, and Yamashita Park are located nearby.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nOn December 10, 2018, it was announced that the Final Stage of SASUKE 36's special would be broadcast live from the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse on TBS on New Year's Eve.  The 2019 edition of SASUKE's Final Stage will once again be broadcast live from the warehouse on December 31, 2019. It will be the 2nd consecutive SASUKE tournament to have a live Final Stage. \n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn with the Old: Yokohama's Red Brick Warehouses (in English)\nRed Brick Warehouse Yokohama - AsiaRooms.com (in English)\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouses, the building No.1 (in Japanese)\nThe Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse Official Homepage (in Japanese)",

        "wiki": "Yokohama (Japanese: \u6a2a\u6d5c, pronounced [jokohama] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Japan by population, and the most populous municipality of Japan. It is the capital city of Kanagawa Prefecture. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kant\u014d region of the main island of Honshu. It is a major commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area.\nYokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nYokohama (\u6a2a\u6d5c) literally means \"horizontal beach\". The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the \u014coka River and the Nakamura River had been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a \"horizontal beach\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening of the Treaty Port (1859\u20131868) ===\nYokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners. A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853\u201354, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.It was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the bustling town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the T\u014dkaid\u014d for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.Yokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English speaking residents as The Bluff.\nKannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, inside the barrier), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound.  Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.\nTo protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city. Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan's first English language newspaper, the Japan Herald published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream and beer to be produced in Japan.  Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863 and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866 and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly \u2013 attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji and Taisho Periods (1868\u20131923) ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan's first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan's first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel Around the World in Eighty Days, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.\nIn 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city's first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal-burning plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889. By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.\nThe early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Great Kanto earthquake and the Second World War (1923\u20131945) ===\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923 by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170. Fuelled by rumours of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum. Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake. Martial law was in place until November 19. Rubble from the quake was used to reclaim land for parks, the most famous being the Yamashita Park on the waterfront which opened in 1930.\n\nYokohama was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by U.S. air raids during World War II. An estimated seven or eight thousand people were killed in a single morning on May 29, 1945 in what is now known as the Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the city and in just one hour and nine minutes reduced 42% of it to rubble.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II growth ===\nDuring the American occupation, Yokohama was a major transshipment base for American supplies and personnel, especially during the Korean War. After the occupation, most local U.S. naval activity moved from Yokohama to an American base in nearby Yokosuka.\nThe city was designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956.The city's tram and trolleybus system was abolished in 1972, the same year as the opening of the first line of Yokohama Municipal Subway.\nConstruction of Minato Mirai 21 (\"Port Future 21\"), a major urban development project on reclaimed land, started in 1983.  Minato Mirai 21 hosted the Yokohama Exotic Showcase in 1989, which saw the first public operation of maglev trains in Japan and the opening of Cosmo Clock 21, then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. The 860m-long Yokohama Bay Bridge opened in the same year.\nIn 1993, Minato Mirai saw the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup final was held in June at the International Stadium Yokohama.\nIn 2009, the city marked the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration.  An early part in the commemoration project incorporated the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) which was held in Yokohama in May 2008.\nIn November 2010, Yokohama hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nThese municipalities surround Yokohama.\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nKawasaki\nYokosuka\nZushi\nKamakura\nFujisawa\nYamatoTokyo\n\nMachida\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nYokohama features a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) with hot and humid summers and chilly winters.

        "wiki": "Minato Mirai 21 (\u307f\u306a\u3068\u307f\u3089\u304421, Minato Mirai Nij\u016bichi), often known as simply Minato Mirai and abbreviated as MM, is the central business district of Yokohama, Japan. Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more.

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds. The elevators' speed record was surpassed by elevators of Taipei 101 (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h) in 2004.\nThe building was designed by the architecture and engineering division of Mitsubishi Estate, now Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei and Hugh Stubbins and Associates, later KlingStubbins.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Japan\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest freestanding steel structures\nList of records of Japan\nList of public observation decks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Landmark Tower official site\n Geographic data related to Yokohama Landmark Tower at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Hikawa Maru (\u6c37\u5ddd\u4e38) is a Japanese ocean liner that Yokohama Dock Company built for Nippon Y\u016bsen Kabushiki Kaisha (\"NYK Line\"). She was launched on 30 September 1929 and made her maiden voyage from Kobe to Seattle on 13 May 1930. She is permanently berthed as a museum ship at Yamashita Park, Naka-ku, Yokohama.\nHikawa Maru was one of three Hikawa Maru class motor ships, all named after major Shinto shrines. The Hikawa Shrine is in Saitama in central Honshu. Her two sister ships, both lost in the Second World War, were Heian Maru and Hie Maru.\n\n\n== Civilian service ==\n\nHikawa Maru and her sisters ran a regular liner route between Yokohama, Vancouver and Seattle. She had a reputation for service that combined splendid food and beautiful art deco interiors, and she was nicknamed \"The Queen of the Pacific\". Charlie Chaplin travelled on her for part of the round the World tour that he made in 1932. Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d, the founder of Judo and Japan's representative on the International Olympic Committee, died whilst aboard in 1938.In 1940\u201341, before Japan's entry to the Second World War, hundreds of Jewish refugees from Nazi persecution fled to Canada and the USA via Japan, and many of them sailed on Hikawa Maru. In August 1940 a party of 82 German and Lithuanian Jews who had travelled via the USSR and Vladivostok reached Seattle on Hikawa Maru. Later, Rabbi Zerach Warhaftig and his family travelled east from Lithuania to Japan. They left Yokohama on Hikawa Maru on 5 June 1941 and landed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 17 June. He described the trip as \"a summer vacation and with the war seeming to be so far away\" although, he said \"I didn't have a peaceful mind because of the strong responsibility I had to help the Jewish refugees with the troubles they faced.\"In July 1941 the US and other countries retaliating against Japan's invasion of French Indochina ordered the seizure of Japanese assets. However, the USA gave assurances that the liners would not be seized so Heian Maru and Hikawa Maru continued their regular service to US ports. In October 1941 Hikawa Maru became the last NYK ship to visit a US port before Japan and the US went to war. She brought US refugees to Seattle, and on her return voyage she repatriated 400 Japanese nationals.\n\n\n== Wartime hospital ship ==\n\nOn 1 December 1941, a week before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Mitsubishi Zosen dockyard at Yokohama started to convert Hikawa Maru into a hospital ship, completing work on her on 21 December. She treated Japanese casualties from the US Task Force 8's attacks on Kwajalein and Wotje atolls in February 1942 and repatriated the seriously wounded to Yokosuka. On 15 June 1942 the Japanese cruiser Nagara brought about 500 Japanese wounded from the Battle of Midway to Hashirajima, where they were transferred to Hikawa Maru.Three times Hikawa Maru survived being damaged by mines. The first was on 3 October 1942 while entering port at Surabaya, Java. She was repaired in port and departed on 10 October. The second was on 15 July 1944 when a magnetic mine damaged her off the Caroline Islands. She stopped in Davao in the Philippines on 19\u201326 July where her damage was inspected and on 1 August she reached Yokosuka for repairs. The third was on 17 February 1945 when she was leaving the Port of Singapore. Her stern struck a mine in the Singapore Strait but she returned to port and was repaired. In March and April the Mitsubishi dockyard at Yokohama made further repairs on her, and from 21 June to 4 July she was drydocked at Maizuru.\n\n\n== Post-war service ==\n\nWhen Japan surrendered on 15 August Hikawa Maru was one of only two Japanese large passenger ships to have survived the war. The other was another hospital ship, Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Takasago Maru. Hie Maru and Heian Maru had been converted into submarine depot ships and were attacked and sunk in 1943 and '44.The USA occupied Japan and in September 1945 the Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine (SCAJAP) requisitioned Hikawa Maru as ship number H-022. She repatriated thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians from the Pacific Islands, Korea, the Dutch East Indies and China until August 1946, when she docked in Yokohama for repairs.In 1947 SCAJAP returned Hikawa Maru to NYK, which despite her passenger capacity ran her mostly as a cargo ship until 1953. Her work included general cargo between Japan and the East Coast of the United States, a liner service between Japan and Burma in 1949, and iron ore from Thailand. In the war NYK had lost 172 ships totalling 1.028 million gross tons, which may explain why the company used an ocean liner for any cargo.\nIn 1953 NYK had Hikawa Maru refitted as an ocean liner and returned her to her pre-war Yokohama \u2013 Seattle route. She remained on the route until NYK decommissioned her on 21 December 1960. Her peacetime service on the route 1930\u201341 and 1953\u201360 totalled 238 voyages and 25,000 passengers.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nIn 1961 Hikawa Maru was permanently berthed at Yamashita Park, Naka-ku, Yokohama as a floating museum, hotel and restaurant. In 2005 her owners announced that they had suffered substantial financial losses and were seeking to sell Hikawa Maru. In December 2006 her museum was closed and doubts about her future were raised. However, NYK Line underwrote her restoration, which began in August 2007. She was renamed NYK Hikawamaru and was reopened to the public at Yamashita Park on 25 April 2008.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nTate, E. Mowbray (1986).

        "wiki": "Yamate (\u5c71\u624b) is the name of a historic neighbourhood in Naka-ku, Yokohama often referred to in English as The Bluff. The neighbourhood is famous as having been a foreigners' residential area in the Bakumatsu, Meiji and Taish\u014d periods. While still dominantly residential in character, with views over downtown Yokohama, historic residential properties, ornamental gardens and public parks, the area is also a popular visitor destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Port of Yokohama first opened to foreign trade under the terms of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1859, the foreigner's settlement was initially confined to a low-lying area known as Kannai. As commercial activity in the Kannai settlement rapidly outgrew the available space, construction on the elevated Yamate Bluff started in 1862. Initially a residential area for the foreign diplomatic community, one of the first structures to be built on the Bluff was the residence of the British Consul-General, Sir Rutherford Alcock.\n\n\n=== British Military Garrison ===\nFrom 1862 until 1875, British diplomatic and commercial interests were protected by a troop garrison stationed at Yamate at the crest of the hill overlooking the harbour, a location that now serves as Harbour View Park. After a series of attacks on the British legation at Yedo a military guard for British diplomats stationed at Yokohama was first established in 1860. In 1861 this small detachment was supplemented by Royal Marines from HMS Renard. Much larger numbers of troops of the 20th (East Devonshire) Regiment of the Foot arrived on troopship HMS Vulcan in January 1864, together with two companies of the 2nd Baloochees from the Bombay Native Infantry.  A Marine battalion arrived on May 25, 1864, aboard HMS Conqueror, bringing garrison troop numbers in that year to 1,700. In subsequent years these units were replaced by members of the 9th (East Norfolk),11th, 67th and the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot.\n\n Contemporary maps produced in 1864 indicate that officer and troop accommodation, a naval hospital, stores facilities and a large parade ground stretched from the modern park area overlooking the harbour as far as the current location of Christ Church, Yokohama. Team sports, notably cricket and rugby union, were introduced to Japan for the first time on the parade ground by British service personnel.Conditions in the camp varied greatly; while the wooden huts of the 20th regiment afforded greater protection from the vagaries of the weather, bell tents assigned to the Marine Battalion provided little protection against the torrential rain and humidity of the Yokohama summer. Detailed Royal Navy medical records of the period reported frequent smallpox outbreaks among the troops and that a dysentery epidemic shortly after the arrival of the Marine Battalion in the summer of 1864 claimed the lives of 11 men.During the same period the French diplomatic mission also had a smaller detachment of troops located at a site adjacent to its own consular property. A French military hospital was also established the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Historic Residential Properties ==\n\nOver succeeding years during the Meiji era, many senior officers of the Kannai trading companies, oyatoi gaikokujin and the diplomatic representatives of other trading nations established homes in the neighbourhood.\nAlthough many of the original foreign resident's accommodation and civic buildings were destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, a number of older Meiji and Taish\u014d Period properties have been preserved and relocated to this neighbourhood. The buildings and their ornamental gardens are open to the public free of charge and serve as popular tourist attractions, many featuring tea rooms, art and seasonal ikebana exhibits. Current properties from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and early Showa periods open to visitors include:\n\nDiplomat's House (1910) designed for Japanese Ambassador Sadatsuchi Uchida by James McDonald Gardiner. Located adjacent to the Bluff 18 House in the Italian Garden Park.\nThe Ehrismann Residence (1927) designed by Antonin Raymond\nBerrick Hall (1930) designed by Jay H. Morgan as the residence of a British trading merchant.\nFormer British Consul's Residence (1937) located in Harbour View Park\nYamate 111 House designed by Jay H. Morgan and the Yamate 234 house.\n\n\n== Sightseeing and local landmarks ==\n\nThe area features the campuses of Yokohama International School, Saint Maur International School and Ferris University.  Additionally:\n\nHarbour View Park Minato no mieru oka koen (\u6e2f\u306e\u898b\u3048\u308b\u4e18\u516c\u5712)\nYokohama Foreign General Cemetery established in 1859, contains graves and memorials to many prominent members of the Bakumatsu and Meiji Period foreign community.

Pedestrian access to and from the station and the historic properties on the Yamate ridge road is facilitated by elevators and escalators rising directly from the station on Motomachi Shopping Street to America-yama Park.\nIshikawacho Station on the JR East Negishi Line provides alternative pedestrian access to sites such as the Italian Garden Park, Bluff 18 House and Ferris University. Yamate Station, also on the JR East Negishi Line, serves the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club and the site of the former Negishi Racecourse.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is also known by the pen name Saka Kosen (\u583a\u67af\u5ddd). He is also known for his translation with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSakai was born as the third son to a samurai class family in what is now Miyako, Fukuoka. He attended what is now the Kaisei Academy where he studied the English language. However, he was expelled from the prestigious No.1 Higher Middle School for failure to pay his tuition, and worked as a tutor and a journalist in Fukuoka and Osaka while studying literature on his own, and writing works of fiction. He was invited to Tokyo by Suematsu Kench\u014d to stay at the residence of the former M\u014dri clan to help edit a history of the Meiji Restoration.Afterwards, he went to work for the Yorozu Morning News, where he began to support social justice causes and pacifism.In 1903, Sakai established the socialist organization Heiminsha, together with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku and Uchimura Kanz\u014d. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Yorozu Morning News adopted a pro-government stance, and Sakai quit to form the weekly Heimin Shimbun together with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku, which was critical of the war and decried the high taxes which the war was causing. It also published a Japanese translation of the Communist Manifesto in its November 13, 1904, issue. Sakai was sentenced to two months in jail. Sakai was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto movement, helping create the Japana Esperanto-Instituto in 1906.In 1906, Sakai became one of the founding members of the Japan Socialist Party. He was arrested in the 1908 Red Flag Incident and was sentenced to two years in prison. Following the end of the First World War he participated in  Rousoukai group. In 1922, he became one of the founding members of the Japan Communist Party and was elected to a seat in the Tokyo City Assembly in 1929. Sakai translated many works related to socialism, as well as utopian literature into Japanese. In June 1932, he was admitted to a hospital after an incident of domestic violence under suspicion of insanity, and died of a cerebral hemorrhage on January 23, 1933. His grave is at the temple of S\u014dj\u014d-ji in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapanese dissidence during the Sh\u014dwa period\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\ne-texts of Sakai's works at Aozora Bunko",

In subsequent years these units were replaced by members of the 9th (East Norfolk),11th, 67th and the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot.\n\n Contemporary maps produced in 1864 indicate that officer and troop accommodation, a naval hospital, stores facilities and a large parade ground stretched from the modern park area overlooking the harbour as far as the current location of Christ Church, Yokohama. Team sports, notably cricket and rugby union, were introduced to Japan for the first time on the parade ground by British service personnel.Conditions in the camp varied greatly; while the wooden huts of the 20th regiment afforded greater protection from the vagaries of the weather, bell tents assigned to the Marine Battalion provided little protection against the torrential rain and humidity of the Yokohama summer. Detailed Royal Navy medical records of the period reported frequent smallpox outbreaks among the troops and that a dysentery epidemic shortly after the arrival of the Marine Battalion in the summer of 1864 claimed the lives of 11 men.During the same period the French diplomatic mission also had a smaller detachment of troops located at a site adjacent to its own consular property. A French military hospital was also established the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Historic Residential Properties ==\n\nOver succeeding years during the Meiji era, many senior officers of the Kannai trading companies, oyatoi gaikokujin and the diplomatic representatives of other trading nations established homes in the neighbourhood.\nAlthough many of the original foreign resident's accommodation and civic buildings were destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, a number of older Meiji and Taish\u014d Period properties have been preserved and relocated to this neighbourhood. The buildings and their ornamental gardens are open to the public free of charge and serve as popular tourist attractions, many featuring tea rooms, art and seasonal ikebana exhibits. Current properties from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and early Showa periods open to visitors include:\n\nDiplomat's House (1910) designed for Japanese Ambassador Sadatsuchi Uchida by James McDonald Gardiner. Located adjacent to the Bluff 18 House in the Italian Garden Park.\nThe Ehrismann Residence (1927) designed by Antonin Raymond\nBerrick Hall (1930) designed by Jay H. Morgan as the residence of a British trading merchant.\nFormer British Consul's Residence (1937) located in Harbour View Park\nYamate 111 House designed by Jay H. Morgan and the Yamate 234 house.\n\n\n== Sightseeing and local landmarks ==\n\nThe area features the campuses of Yokohama International School, Saint Maur International School and Ferris University.  Additionally:\n\nHarbour View Park Minato no mieru oka koen (\u6e2f\u306e\u898b\u3048\u308b\u4e18\u516c\u5712)\nYokohama Foreign General Cemetery established in 1859, contains graves and memorials to many prominent members of the Bakumatsu and Meiji Period foreign community. There is also a small museum on site with photographs and descriptions of individual community members and their contributions to the development of Yokohama.\nAnglican, Christ Church first established in Yamashita-cho in 1863\nCatholic, Sacred Heart Cathedral first established in Yamashita-cho in 1862\nKirin Park adjacent to the location of William Copeland's original Spring Valley Brewery, the first beer production facility of any notable size in Japan.\nYokohama Country & Athletic Club, Japan's oldest sporting and social club founded in 1868.\nFormer Negishi Racecourse. Constructed in 1866 as a replacement for the original 1862 Swamp Ground racecourse at the rear of the Kannai foreign settlement. Home to some of the earliest horse races in Japan, conducted in a recognisably European style. Horseracing came to and end at the site in 1942. Now a public park and home to a small museum of horseracing.  The main grandstand designed in 1929 by American architect Jay H. Morgan is still a prominent landmark.\nItalian Garden Park\nGaiety Theatre Museum, built on the site of the Gaiety Theatre established in 1866.\nThe Yokohama Cat Museum\nThe Yokohama Tin Toys MuseumThe neighborhood still maintains a reputation as an exclusive residential district today, along with the Motomachi neighborhood located at the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nYamate is served by Motomachi-Ch\u016bkagai Station, the terminus of the Minatomirai Line subway. Pedestrian access to and from the station and the historic properties on the Yamate ridge road is facilitated by elevators and escalators rising directly from the station on Motomachi Shopping Street to America-yama Park.\nIshikawacho Station on the JR East Negishi Line provides alternative pedestrian access to sites such as the Italian Garden Park, Bluff 18 House and Ferris University. Yamate Station, also on the JR East Negishi Line, serves the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club and the site of the former Negishi Racecourse.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Urashima Tar\u014d (\u6d66\u5cf6 \u592a\u90ce) is the protagonist of a Japanese fairy tale (otogi banashi), who in a typical modern version is a fisherman rewarded for rescuing a turtle, and carried on its back to the Dragon Palace (Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d) beneath the sea. There he is entertained by the princess Otohime as a reward. He spends what he believes to be several days with the princess, but when he returns to his home village, he discovers he has been gone for at least 100 years. When he opens the forbidden jewelled box (tamatebako), given to him by Otohime on his departure, he turns into an old man.\nThe tale originates from the legend of Urashimako (Urashima no ko or Ura no Shimako) recorded in various pieces of literature dating to the 8th century, such as the Fudoki for Tango Province, Nihon Shoki, and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b.\nDuring the Muromachi to Edo periods, versions of Urashima Tar\u014d appeared in storybook form called the Otogiz\u014dshi, made into finely painted picture scrolls and picture books or mass-printed copies. These texts vary considerably, and in some, the story ends with Urashima Tar\u014d transforming into a crane.\nSome iconic elements in the modern version are relatively recent. The portrayal of him riding a turtle dates only to the early 18th century, and while he is carried underwater to the Dragon Palace in modern tellings, he rides a boat to the princess's world called H\u014drai in older versions..\n\n\n== Folktale or fairy tale ==\nThe Urashima Tar\u014d tales familiar to most Japanese follows the storyline of children's tale author Iwaya Sazanami in the Meiji period. A condensed version of Sazanami's retelling then appeared in Kokutei ky\u014dkasho, Japan's nationally designated textbook for the elementary school, and became widely read by the schoolchildren of the populace. Modern versions of Urashima Tar\u014d, which are generally similar, are demonstrably based on the story from these nationally designated textbook series.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOne day a young fisherman named Urashima Tar\u014d is fishing when he notices a group of children torturing a small turtle. Tar\u014d saves it and lets it to go back to the sea. The next day, a huge turtle approaches him and tells him that the small turtle he had saved is the daughter of the Emperor of the Sea, Ry\u016bjin, who wants to see him to thank him. The turtle magically gives Tar\u014d gills and brings him to the bottom of the sea, to the Palace of the Dragon God (Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d). There he meets the Emperor and the small turtle, who was now a lovely princess, Otohime. On each of the four sides of the palace it is a different season.\nTar\u014d stays there with Otohime for three days, but soon wants to go back to his village and see his aging mother, so he requests permission to leave. The princess says she is sorry to see him go, but wishes him well and gives him a mysterious box called tamatebako which will protect him from harm but which she tells him never to open. Tar\u014d grabs the box, jumps on the back of the same turtle that had brought him there, and soon is at the seashore.\nWhen he goes home, everything has changed. His home is gone, his mother has vanished, and the people he knew are nowhere to be seen. He asks if anybody knows a man called Urashima Tar\u014d. They answer that they had heard someone of that name had vanished at sea long ago. He discovers that 300 years have passed since the day he left for the bottom of the sea. Struck by grief, he absent-mindedly opens the box the princess had given him, from which bursts forth a cloud of white smoke. He is suddenly aged, his beard long and white, and his back bent. From the sea comes the sad, sweet voice of the princess: \"I told you not to open that box. In it was your old age ...\".\n\n\n== Commonly known version ==\n\nA summary of the Urashima tale from one of the nationalized textbooks (Kokutei ky\u014dkasho) will be given below. The base text used will be Urashima Tar\u014d (\u3046\u3089\u3057\u307e\u592a\u90ce), from the 3rd edition of the Kokugo tokuhon or \"national language reader\", a widely familiar textbook used during the 1918\u20131932 period. An English translation has been provided in Yoshiko Holmes's thesis.\nLong ago, a man named Urashima Tar\u014d of unidentified profession (or, in recent textbooks often a fisherman) found a turtle on the beach being toyed with by a group of children. He purchased the turtle and released it in the ocean.\nTwo or three days later, while he was fishing on a boat as always, the grateful turtle came and told him he would carry him on his back to the underwater Dragon Palace (Ry\u016bg\u016b). At the palace, the princess (Otohime) thanked him for saving the turtle.After an unspecified number of days, remembrance of his mother and father made him homesick, and he bid farewell to Otohime. The princess tried to dissuade him from leaving, but finally let him go with a parting gift, a mysterious box called tamatebako whose lid he was told never to open.\n\nWhen Tar\u014d returned to his hometown, everything had changed. His home was gone, his mother and father had perished, and the people he knew were nowhere to be seen. Not remembering the princess's warning, he lifted the lid of the box. A cloud of white smoke arose, turning him to a  white-haired old man.\nThe story remained as one of the dozen tales included in the 4th edition of national language reader textbooks also known as Sakura tokuhon) used from 1933\u2013ca. 1940, thus continuing to enjoy wide recognition; for this reason Urashima could be considered one of the core stories of the so-called Japanese \"national fairy tales\".\n\n\n== School song ==\nThere are a number of renditions set to music. Among the most popular is the school song \"Urashima Tar\u014d\" (\u6d66\u5cf6\u592a\u90ce) of 1911 which begins with the line \"Mukashi, mukashi Urashima wa, tasuketa kame ni tsurerarete (Long long ago was Urashima, by the turtle he rescued taken to the sea)\", printed in the  Jinj\u014d sh\u014dgaku sh\u014dka (1911). This song's author was long relegated to anonymity, but the lyricist is now considered to be Okkotsu Sabur\u014d.Another school song \"Urashima Tar\u014d\" (\u3046\u3089\u3057\u307e\u305f\u308d\u3046, lyrics by Ishihara Wasabur\u014d and music by Tamura Toraz\u014d) appeared in the Y\u014dnen sh\u014dka (1900). Although written in stilted classical language, Miura considered this version the more familiar.\n\n\n== Otogiz\u014dshi ==\n\nLong before the versions in 19th century textbooks, there had been the otogi-z\u014dshi versions from the Muromachi period. Conventionally, commentators using the term otogiz\u014dshi are referring by default to the text found in the Otogi Bunko (or \"Companion Library\"), since it was printed and widely disseminated.\n\n\n=== Otogi Bunko ===\nIn the Otogi Bunko (or \"Companion Library\") version, a young fisherman named Urashima Tar\u014d catches a turtle on his fishing line and releases it. The next day, Urashima encounters a boat with a woman on it wishing to be escorted home. She does not identify herself, although she is the transformation of the turtle that was spared. When Urashima rows her boat to her magnificent residence, she proposes that they marry. The residence is the Dragon Palace, and on the four sides of the palace, each gardenscape is in a different season. Urashima decides to return to his home after three years and is given a memento box (\u304b\u305f\u307f\u306e\u7b65/\u7bb1, katami no hako) in parting. He arrives in his hometown to find it desolate, and discovers 700 years have passed since he last left it. He cannot restrain his temptation to open the box which he was cautioned not to open, whereupon three wisps of purple cloud appear and turn him into an old man. It ends with Urashima Tar\u014d transforming into a crane, and his wife reverting back to the form of a turtle, the two thereafter revered as my\u014djin (Shinto deities).\n\n\n=== Variants and groups ===\nThere are actually over 50 texts of the Urashima Tar\u014d otogi-z\u014dshi extant. These variants fall into four broad groups, clustered by their similarity. The Otogi Bunko text belongs to Group IV.\n\n\n=== Group closest to modern version ===\n\nThe Otogi Bunko version, despite its conventional status as the type text, differs considerably from the typical children's storybook published in the modern day: the protagonist neither purchases the turtle from others to save it, nor rides the turtle.Group I texts are more similar to the modern version, as it contains the element of Urashima purchasing the turtle to save it. Additionally, this group explicitly gives the princess's name as Otomime (or \"Kame-no-Otohime\") whereas she remains unnamed in the Otogi Bunko group. And the expression tamatebako or \"jeweled hand-box\" familiar to modern readers is also seen in the main text of Group I, and not the other groups (the interpolated poem excepted).The picture scroll in the collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford University also belongs to Group I.Hayashi Kouhei has highlighted the characteristics of the Group I texts as follows: 1) Urashima purchases a turtle caught by others, 2) Boat arrives to convey him to Horai, 3) The four seasons assuage rather than provoke his homesickness, 4) The villagers in recognition of his longevity give him proper cremation, 5) Smoke from tamatebako reach Horai and Princess Otohime is grief-stricken.\n\n\n== Other modern versions ==\n\n\n=== Seki's version in English ===\nThe tale of \"Urashima Taro\" in Keigo Seki's anthology (translated into English 1963), was a version told in Nakatado District, Kagawa. In this variant, Urashima is localized as being from \"Kitamae Oshima\". It incorporates both the motif of the turtle being caught while fishing, and that of Urashima transforming into a crane at the end, which are found in the Otogiz\u014dshi.\nHere, it was a three-tiered jeweled hand-box (\u4e09\u91cd\u306d\u306e\u7389\u624b\u7bb1, mitsugasane no tamatebako), that is to say, a stacked box that was given to Urashima. When he opened the lid, the first box (on the top) contained a crane's feather, and the second a puff of white smoke that turned him into an old man, and the third a mirror, which made him see for himself that he had suddenly grown old. The feather from the first box then attached itself to his back, and Urashima flew up to the sky, encircling his mother's grave.\n\n\n=== Versions retold in English ===\nThe story entitled \"The Fisher-boy Urashima\" (1886) retold by Basil Hall Chamberlain, was number 8 in the \"Japanese Fairy Tale Series\" printed by Hasegawa Takejir\u014d, the issuer of many such chirimen-bon or \"crepe-paper books\". Although the illustrations are not credited in the publication, they have been attributed to Kobayashi Eitaku.There is no single base text in Japanese identifiable, although it has been conjectured that Chamberlain adapted from \"a popular version\" and not straying far from it except adding explanatory or instructive passages for young readers. Others have determined it must have been a composite consisting of older traditions from the Nihon Shoki and Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, combined with the near-modern Otogiz\u014dshi storybook plot, Chamberlain preferring to incorporate details from the ancient texts, while eschewing embellishment from the Otogiz\u014dshi.In Chamberlain's version, \"Urashima\" (not \"Tar\u014d\") catches a tortoise (sic) while fishing on his boat, and releases it. The tortoise reappears in her true form as the Sea-God's daughter, and invites him to the Dragon Palace.There the couple are married and live happily for 3 years, but Urashima misses seeing his parents and his brothers. The Dragon Princess reluctantly allows him to leave, giving him a box he is instructed never to open, for it will cause him never to be able to return to the palace. When he returns to his home village, his absence turns out to have been 400 years. Urashima now wishes to go back to the Dragon Palace but he does not know the means, and opens the box. He turns into a white-haired, wrinkled old man and dies. The ending by death concurs with older tradition, and not the otogi-z\u014dshi storybook.Lafcadio Hearn, who lived in Japan and translated or adapted many ghost stories from the country, rewrote the Urashima tale under the title The Dream of a Summer Day in the late 19th century, working off of a copy of Chamberlain's \"Japanese Fairy Tale Series\" version.\n\n\n=== Variations ===\nAs always with folklore, there are many different versions of this story.\nThere are other versions that add a further epilogue explaining the subsequent fate of Urashima Tar\u014d after he turns into an old man. In one, he falls to dust and dies, in another, he transforms into a crane and flies up to the sky. In another, he grows gills and leaps into the sea, whereby he regains his youth.In another version Urashima ate a magic pill that gave him the ability to breathe underwater. In another version, he is swept away by a storm before he can rescue the turtle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe full name Urashima Tar\u014d was not given to the character until the 15th century (the Muromachi period), first appearing in a genre of illustrated popular fiction known as otogiz\u014dshi, and in the ky\u014dgen play adaptation.The story itself can be found in much older sources, dating to the 8th century (the Nara period), where the protagonist is styled either \"Urashima no ko\" or \"Ura (no) Shimako\", attested in earlier sources such as the Fudoki for Tango Province (Tango no Kuni Fudoki, \u4e39\u5f8c\u56fd\u98a8\u571f\u8a18) that survived in excerpts, the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and the Nihon Shoki.More recent editions of these texts tend to favor the \"Ura (no) Shimako\" reading, although some consider this debatable.It has also been proposed that it was not until the Heian Period that the misreading \"Urashima (no) ko\" became current, because names with the suffix -ko (\"child\") came to be regarded as female, even though it once applied to either gender. When the texts were written for the ky\u014dgen theatre, the character's name underwent further change to Urashima Tar\u014d, with -tar\u014d (\"great youth\") being a common suffix in male names. Or perhaps the name was borrowed from Tar\u014d kaja who is a stock character in ky\u014dgen.\n\n\n=== Dragon Palace ===\nThe Man'y\u014dsh\u016b ballad mentions not only the woman of the Immortal Land, but her father as the Sea God (Watatsumi). Although this Sea God cannot be automatically equated with the Dragon God or Dragon King, due to the influence of the Chinese mythology of Nine Offspring of the Dragon in the Tang period, it has been speculated that the turtle princess must have been the Dragon King's daughter in even those early versions.The otherworld Urashima visited was not the \"Dragon Palace\" (Ry\u016bg\u016b) until the otogi-z\u014dshi versions appeared. The heroine then became Otohime, the younger daughter of the Dragon King.\n\n\n=== Relative dates ===\nAs for the relative dating of these texts, an argument has been advanced that places the Fudoki version as the oldest. The argument dates the Tango fudoki to shortly after 715, but the compilers refer to an earlier record by Iyobe no Umakai, which was identical in content. It has even been suggested by Sh\u016bichi Kat\u014d that this Umakai originally adapted this tale into Japanese from a similar Chinese tale.\n\n\n== Tango Fudoki ==\n\nIn this version, the protagonist is referred to as \"Urashimako of Mizunoe\" (or \"Urashimako of Tsutsukawa in Yosa-gun\".\nUrashimako catches a five-coloured turtle and keeps it in his boat, and during his sleep, the creature transforms into a beautiful woman. She identifies herself as someone from the household of immortals, and proposes to take him to the place of immortals, which may be Horaisan (Mount Penglai) or \"Tokoyo-no-kuni\" (\"Timeless Land\" or \"Land of Eternity\").They are greeted by first seven, then eight children, who represent the constellations of Pleiades and Taurus (or more precisely the Hyades cluster) who address him as the \"husband of Kame Hime (Princess Turtle)\". The remainder is mostly the same as the typical tale.After three years, the man develops a longing for his parents and homeland. The princess is saddened, but imparts him with a jeweled comb box (tamakushige, \u7389\u5323), forbidding him to open it if he wished ever to return to her. He returns and finds no trace of his home or family, except that he is remembered as a man who disappeared long ago, and would be over three hundred years old if still alive. Forgetting the promise, he opens the box, whereupon a beautiful figure like a fragrant orchid is carried away to the heavens with the clouds, and he realizes he can never meet the princess again. Still, the couple are somehow (supernaturally) able to exchange poems. These poems are recorded in phonetic man'y\u014dgana.\n\n\n== Nihon Shoki ==\nIn the Nihon Shoki, Urashimako of Mizunoe is mentioned in the entry for Autumn, 7th month the 22nd year of reign of Emperor Y\u016bryaku. Aston's translation assigns this the year 478 A.D. The entry states that Urashimako (child Urashima, child of Urashima, etc.) of Mizunoe while fishing on a boat, caught a turtle which transformed into a woman. They went into the sea, and reached Mount H\u014drai (glossed in kana as Tokoyo), where they saw immortals (\u4ed9\u8846 (\u3072\u3058\u308a)).As to the phrase that they go \"into the sea\" implies, the Mount H\u014drai as conceived here may be a submarine island, a suggestion made by Japanese literature professor \u014ckuma Kiichir\u014d.\n\n\n== Manyoshu ==\nA poem reflecting upon the legend of Urashima of Mizunoe occurs in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. The piece is ascribed to Takahashi no Mushimaro. Early translations include the prose rendition by Aston, and the ballad-form by Chamberlain.In this version, the woman of the Immortal Land (Tokoyo) appears as the daughter of the Sea God (Watatsumi no kami).\n\n\n== Localizations ==\n\n\n=== Yokohama ===\n\nBasil Hall Chamberlain (1880) indicated the presence of a temple dedicated to Urashima at Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, which housed several relics such as Urashima's fishing-line, and the casket (tamatebako). But when Ernest Satow went there with Chamberlain on 2 May 1880, there was nothing left to see except the statue of Kannon (Kanzeon), the goddess of mercy.Neither recorded the name to the temple, but Japanese sources write that the so-called Urashima-dera (Urashima Temple) used to be  Kanpuku-ji (\u89b3\u798f\u5bfa), until it burned down in 1868, and the temple, including the Kannon goddess statue got translated to Keiun-ji (\u6176\u904b\u5bfa) in 1872.The old Urashima-dera sat on a mountain top. There is a circulating pamphlet which shows the view of the harbor from this vantage point, depicting the fleet of Black Ships led by Commodore Perry's fleet in 1852\u20131854.Local legend also claims native ties to Urashima Tar\u014d, claiming that his father Urashima Tay\u016b was originally from somewhere not far from Yokohama, in Miura District, Kanagawa in Sagami Province. But the father moved to \nTango Province. This legend adds that when Urashima Tar\u014d returned from the Dragon Place, he was guided to seek his parents' grave in \"Shirahata, Musashi Province\" (in today's Yokohama).\nHe finally found the grave, thanks to Princess Oto-hime who lit up an illuminating light on a pine branch. Tar\u014d built a hut to live here, housing the goddess statue from the Dragon Palace. The hut later became Kampuku-ji temple.\n\n\n=== Okinawa ===\nChamberlain noted the theory that the Dragon Palace might be a romanticized notion of Okinawa, since \"Ry\u016bg\u016b\" (Dragon Palace) and Ry\u016bky\u016b (Okinawa) are near homophones.Recorded in Ir\u014d setsuden (\u907a\u8001\u8aac\u4f1d, \"Accounts Left by Oldmen\") of the 18th century, Tale 103 \"A person of Yonaha village visits the Dragon Palace\" is considered analogous to Urashima Tar\u014d. In it, a certain man of Yonaha village in Haebaru finds a lock of black hair and returns it to a beautiful maiden. She leads him to the Dragon Palace. Three months pass and the man wishes to return, but the goddess reveals 33 generations have already passed in his absence. The man receives a folded-up piece of paper he is forbidden from unwrapping, but he opens this packet and a piece of white hair clings to him, turning him into an old man, and he dies. He was enshrined at the place which was named Usani-daki, because the man had \"sat and reposed\" (usani) in his despair.Similar tales are found on Miyako-jima and other places. Yanagita Kunio felt that the notion of the Dragon Palace shared its origin with the concept of Niruya (Niraikanai) in the southerly islands of Japan.Ir\u014d setsuden also records a similar tale, number 42, about Yoshinawa Fuyako (\u5584\u7e04\u5927\u5c4b\u5b50), which describes a man who, bidden by a mysterious woman appeared before him, carried a large turtle to his home, which bit and gave him a terrible wound so that he was buried. But he turned out not to have died a mortals death, and lived on.\n\n\n=== Kiso, Nagano ===\n\nLocal legend has it that Urashima Tar\u014d once dwelled in the mountains of Kiso, Nagano. This legend originated in near-modern times, from the late Muromachi to Edo periods.Although a contrived piece of fiction, the old-style j\u014druri Urashima Tar\u014d (\u300e\u6d66\u5d8b\u592a\u90ce\u300f) situates its story in the vicinity of this local legend, namely Agematsu-juku. Urashima Tar\u014d appears here as a child born after a local couple prays to Togakushi My\u014djin. He and Tamayori-hime fall in love. She is very much a mortal, but after she commits suicide in Ina River (tributary of Kiso River), she becomes transformed into a supernatural being serving the Dragon Palace. A scale cloak lets her transform into a turtle, in which guise, she is reunited with Urashima Tar\u014d who is fishing in Ina River. Note the \"catching of the turtle\" scene is transposed from ocean to a river in the mountains.\n\n\n== Comparative mythology ==\nThe story bears varying degrees of similarity to folktales from other cultures. Rip Van Winkle is the foremost familiar example, although strictly speaking this cannot be called a \"folktale\", since it is a fictional work by Washington Irving loosely based on folklore. Nevertheless, Urashima has been labeled the \"Japanese Rip van Winkle\", even in academic folkloristic literature. \"Urashima\" is also a Japanese metaphor similar to \"Rip Van Winkle\" for someone who feels lost in a world that has changed in their absence.This pair of tales may not be the closest matching among the motif group. Writing in the 19th century, Lafcadio Hearn suggested that Irving wrote another piece called \"The Adelantado of the Seven Cities\", based on Portuguese tradition, which bore an even stronger resemblance to Urashima. Japanese art collector William Anderson also wrote that a certain Chinese tale was closer to \"Rip Van Winkle\" than Urashima was.That Chinese analogue is the anecdote of the woodcutter Wang Zhi, who after watching immortals playing a board game discovers many years have passed. The piece is a selection in the Shuyiji or \"Accounts of Strange Things\", and is also known as the legend of Lankeshan or \"Rotten Axe Handle Mountain\". Sometimes this Chinese tale is conjectured as a possible actual source for Urashima, but there is lack of consensus among folklorists regarding their interrelationship.Other cognate tales include the Irish legend of Ois\u00edn who met Niamh and spent his life with her in T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, and the Vietnamese legend of T\u1eeb Th\u1ee9c, who aids a fairy-child arrested for plucking a peony flower during the festivities. In both these cases, the hero is united with a fairy woman who dwells in a land beyond the sea. T\u1eeb Th\u1ee9c's story is collected in Truy\u1ec1n k\u1ef3 m\u1ea1n l\u1ee5c by Nguy\u1ec5n D\u1eef.\nThe tale of Urashima Taro holds many similarities with tales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther index ATU 681, \"The Relativity of Time\". A similar story is The Marsh King's Daughter, a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nA shrine on the western coast of the Tango Peninsula in northern Kyoto Prefecture, named Urashima Jinja, contains an old document describing a man, Urashimako, who left his land in 478 A.D. and visited a land where people never die. He returned in 825 A.D. with a Tamatebako. Ten days later he opened the box, and a cloud of white smoke was released, turning Urashimako into an old man. Later that year, after hearing the story, Emperor Junna ordered Ono no Takamura to build a shrine to commemorate Urashimako's strange voyage, and to house the Tamatebako and the spirit of Urashimako.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe animated adaptation Urashima Tar\u014d of the tale, premiered in 1918, is among some of the oldest anime created in Japan, the same year that Oz author Ruth Plumly Thompson adapted it as \"Urashima and the Princess of the Sea\" for The Philadelphia Public Ledger.The story influenced various works of fiction and a number of films. In 1945, Japanese writer Osamu Dazai published Otogiz\u014dshi (\"fairytale book\"), which includes a much expanded version of the story. Urashima's tale, as the other three included in the Otogiz\u014dshi, is used mostly as a platform for Dazai's own thoughts and musings. Ursula K. Le Guin's short story \"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea\" (or \"Another Story\", 1994) is a reconcoction of the Urashima story set in the Ekumen or Hainish universe.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTamatebako, an origami cube that causes the aging of Urashima Tar\u014d in some versions of the story.\nLankeshan ji\nYuri's Brush with Magic by Maureen Wartski, a young adult novel that integrates the Urashima Taro myth into narrative.\nIsekai, an anime and manga genre that has roots in the Urashima Tar\u014d story.\nPandora's box, a magic box which spread disaster when opened in Greek mythology.\nKing asleep in mountain, several legends of people hidden away in time.\n\"Rip Van Winkle\"\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\nKakudmi and Revati\nHerla\nOis\u00edn\nThe Voyage of Bran\nIara (mythology)\nUrashima effect, another name for time dilation in the theory of relativity.\nHoni ha-M'agel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMcKeon, Midori Yamamoto. \"The Transformation of the Urashima Legend: The Influence of Religion on Gender.\" U.S.-Japan Women's Journal.

        "wiki": "\u014csanbashi Pier (\u5927\u3055\u3093\u6a4b, \u014dsanbashi, pronounced [o\u02d0samba\u0255i]) is the main international passenger pier at the Port of Yokohama, located in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan.  \u014csanbashi is the oldest pier in Yokohama, originally constructed between 1889 and 1896.\nMajor cruise ships such as the Queen Elizabeth 2 were at one time embarked here, although 90,000 GWT ships such as MS Queen Elizabeth are often obliged to use nearby container terminals owing to their enormous size.  The pier is also known as one of the best places to see the Yokohama Three Towers (The King, Queen and the Jack)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Port of Yokohama was opened in 1859 as a direct result of the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, and the Ansei Treaties signed between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Russia. Yokohama grew rapidly as a treaty port and commercial center due to its proximity to Tokyo, natural deep water harbour and protection from strong winds by the Honmoku bluff.\nInitially the port only offered two small stone wharfs for visiting ships, built on the current site of the modern \u014csanbashi Pier.  The two wharfs, known as the French and English Hatoba, were too shallow for the ocean going ships to dock, and so barges were used to carry passengers and freight to and from the ships in the outer harbour.  In 1894, the Japanese government provided funding for an extended steel pier to replace the English Hatoba.  Designed by British engineer, Henry Spencer Palmer, the new pier was able to accommodate up to four ships simultaneously.Although the pier was repaired and enlarged several times, it survived the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, and the bombing raids of World War II largely intact.  During the occupation the pier was renamed South Pier and remained under occupation forces control until 1952.\nIn 1964, a reconstruction of \u014csanbashi Passenger Terminal was completed in time before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\n== Current pier ==\n\nTo meet modern demands, \u014csanbashi Pier was again reconstructed between 1988 and 2002.  The newly reconstructed passenger terminal is named the Yokohama International Passenger Terminal, designed by Foreign Office Architects (Alejandro Zaera-Polo and Farshid Moussavi), the pier was the subject of a major international design competition attracting over 660 entries.  The new pier can accommodate up to four 30,000-ton class ships or two 70,000-ton class ships at the same time.  The departure/arrival lobby, ticketing booth, customs, immigration, large multipurpose hall, shops and cafe are all on the 2nd floor of this terminal. There is a parking facility on the 1st floor, and an extensive, gently curving observation deck with planted grass areas, open to the public on the rooftop.\nThe Port and City of Yokohama developed other renovation and construction projects in the waterfront area, such as the Minato Mirai 21 project, in this time frame.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Architecture Survey\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSakamoto, Tomoko.

Managed by Mitsui Fudosan, the museum houses the extensive collection of model trains built and amassed by the Japanese model railway enthusiast Nobutaro Hara (\u539f \u4fe1\u592a\u90ce, Hara Nobutar\u014d). The museum covers an area of approximately 1,700 m\u00b2, with the display area covering an area of approximately 1,200 m\u00b2.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nApproximately 1,000 items from Hara's private collection of more than 6,000 model railway items are on display. The centrepiece of the museum is a 30-metre x 10 metre diorama called \"Ichiban Tetsumo Park\" (\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u30c6\u30c4\u30e2\u30d1\u30fc\u30af) which features \"1 gauge\" (45 mm gauge) model trains from around the world, and has approximately 450 metres of track. The layout features working overhead lines to power trains via their pantographs. The collection also includes the original models of Thomas the Tank Engine and several of the other characters from the production of Thomas & Friends prior to 2009 when the show was switched to CGI animation, some of which occasionally operate on the layout.Exhibits on display include models in 1 gauge (45 mm gauge, 1/32 scale), 0 gauge, and H0 gauge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was unveiled to the news media on 20 June 2012 ahead of its public opening on 10 July.\n\n\n== Nobutaro Hara ==\nThe owner of the collection, Nobutaro Hara, was born in Tokyo on 4 April 1919, and built his first model train at the age of 13. He studied mechanical engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. After World War II, Hara worked as a development engineer for the office equipment company Kokuyo. In his spare time, he continued to build and collect model trains, travelling to some 380 different countries and building up a collection of over 6,000 items. Over the years, he received a number of invitations from museums to exhibit his models, but always refused. He finally agreed to lend part of his collection to Mitsui Fudosan because the museum was located in Yokohama, the terminal of Japan's first railway, from Shimbashi in Tokyo. Hara died on 5 July 2014 at the age of 95.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe museum is located on the second floor of the Yokohama Mitsui Building in Nishi-ku, Yokohama, and is a two-minute walk from Shin-Takashima Station on the Minatomirai Line, and a five-minute walk from Yokohama Station.\n\n\n=== Address ===\n1-1-2 Takashima, Nishi-ku, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa-ken\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

        "wiki": "The Nissan Tiida is a compact car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Nissan since 2004, spanning two generations.\nFor the first generation of Tiida manufactured between 2004 and 2012, the series is designated C11 and was sold as a five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. This model straddled the subcompact and compact car segments. It retailed in North America as Nissan Versa, in parts of South America as Dodge Trazo, and in Southeast Asia for the sedan only under the title Nissan Latio. The C11 bridged the subcompact and compact car classes, acting as an intermediate model between the smaller Micra/March and larger Bluebird Sylphy and Sentra models within the global Nissan portfolio. Therefore, depending on the market, the C11 replaced different models and engrossed different segments. For example, in Japan the Tiida replaced the Nissan Sunny (B15) in Nissan's lineup as the smallest sedan. In most markets it slotted between the March and Bluebird Sylphy; for North America it became a new entry-level model below the Sentra; and elsewhere Tiida tended to occupy the role performed previously by the Nissan Almera/Pulsar/Sentra/Sunny (N16), sold in Japan as the Bluebird Sylphy (G10). The G10/N16's successor, the Bluebird Sylphy G11 was not widely sold outside Japan. The C11 started to be phased out in China first, during 2011 when partially replaced by the larger, compact class C12 Tiida/Pulsar hatchback. In 2012, the C11 began to be withdrawn from more markets as its main production bases ceased manufacture. The C11 was also replaced by the subcompact Nissan Note or Versa Note (E12) hatchback, and on the sedan fronts, by the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17).\nNissan introduced a second generation of Tiida, the five-door hatchback C12 series in 2011 to the Chinese market. Starting in 2013, sales began in Thailand, then Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 represents a departure from the C11, increasing its dimensions to comfortably occupy the compact class. Nissan Tiida also called \"Patrida car\". The development was anchored with the Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17) which is effectively the sedan version of the C12.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Tiida\" is from the Okinawan language and means \"sun\", continuing the naming tradition started in 1966 with the Nissan Sunny.\n\n\n== First generation (C11; 2004) ==\n\nNissan revealed the C-Note concept car in 2003 to preview the styling of the upcoming Nissan Tiida (C11). It is a concept hatchback based on the same platform of the Renault M\u00e9gane. It included bright beige color interior. The vehicle was unveiled in the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show.The Tiida hatchback and the Tiida Latio sedan debuted in 2004 in Japan, and in some European countries in 2007. It is based on a stretched-wheelbase variant of the Nissan B platform, and was manufactured as a five-door hatchback and a four-door sedan. The engine range included 1.5-, 1.6- and 1.8-liter gasoline engines and a 1.5-liter diesel engine.\nIn January 2008, Nissan introduced facelifted versions of both the hatchback and the sedan. They were enhanced with some key changes including new exterior features and interior designs, retuned power steering, powertrain enhancements and a new Plus navi HDD package called CarWings in Japan.\nThe exterior features a new grille, front bumper, headlights, taillights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports a more modern look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish dash panels.\nEngines include a 1.5-liter or 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, the larger of which can be coupled to a six-speed manual transmission. There are also two optional dealer packages: the Nismo S-tune Aero Package and Nismo Performance Package.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nAsia\n\nIn mainland China, the Tiida is produced by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture between Nissan and a local company. In Taiwan it is produced by Yulon.\nIn Malaysia, the first generation Tiida was sold as the Latio and available with in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The sedan was simply known as Latio while the hatchback was known as the Latio Sport. Unveiled in May 2007 and available in June 2007, fours variants were initially offered for the sedan bodystyle: 1.6 ST (M), 1.6 ST (A), 1.6 ST-L (A), 1.8 Ti (A). The hatchback was available in a sole 1.6 ST-L (A) variant. In April 2008, a limited 'Tuned By Impul' edition was available for both variants. The 'Tuned By Impul' edition featured a bodykit, sports suspension, different exhaust system and different alloy wheels. In September 2011, the facelift version of Latio reduced the variant count to just two. A sole 1.6 variant for the sedan and a sole 1.8 variant for the hatchback.\n\nIn Singapore, the Tiida and Tiida Latio were initially sold alongside the older and cheaper Sunny N16 and the bigger and more expensive Sylphy.\nIn Indonesia, the Tiida 1.8 hatchback was marketed for private use, while the 1.6 sedan was for taxi fleet only.\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiida was used as a police car by the Hong Kong police. Some were police patrol cars whereas some were airport police cars.\nIn Taiwan, both Tiida hatchback and Tiida sedan are produced by Yulon Motors. The Tiida sedan was still in production until May 2018.\nEuropeIn 2007, the first European countries began receiving imports of the Tiida. Although it has not been officially launched in the United Kingdom, some cars destined for the Irish market have been sold in the UK as gray imports.\nNorth AmericaThe Versa was introduced in the United States and Canada in July 2006 as a 2007 model. North and Latin American models of the Tiida use a DOHC 1.8-liter gasoline engine and are assembled at Nissan's Aguascalientes, Mexico assembly plant. It is also the only Nissan four-door passenger car in the United States and Canada to be sold worldwide, since the Sentra, Altima and Maxima are exclusive to North America.\nAccording to a Nissan press release in 2008, \"versa\" is short for \"versatile space\" meant to imply the spaciousness of the interior and configurable cargo arrangements.The North American Versa debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January of the same year. The hatchback model was introduced first, with the sedan arriving later at the end of the year, both as 2007 models. A 1.6-liter sedan replaced the 1.8-liter sedan in Canada for the 2009 model year, that year in the United States the 1.6 sedan was added to the lineup along the 1.8 sedan.\nThe Versa is powered by a 1.8 L I4 MR series engine producing 122 hp (91 kW) and 127 ft\u00b7lbf (170 N\u00b7m). Three transmissions are offered: a four-speed automatic, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a six-speed manual. Two trim levels include the S and SL\u2014the SL offering air conditioning, power accessories and ABS, all of which are options on the S. The Versa SL also has features/options not available on the S such as cruise control (available on some S models), alloy wheels, optional CVT (the four-speed automatic is only available for the Versa S but CVT is available on some S models), optional Bluetooth connectivity for electronic devices, and a sport package which adds a power moonroof, rear spoiler, and underside aero kit.\nIntroduced for the 2009 model year in sedan form only, is the Versa 1.6-liter which uses the HR16DE inline-four gasoline engine, rated at 107 hp (80 kW) and 111 lb\u22c5ft (150 N\u22c5m) of torque. The base transmission is a five-speed manual; a four-speed automatic is optional.\nThe Versa 1.6 features black trim (instead of body-colored) for the exterior mirror housings, license plate trim, and front grille; 14-inch steel wheels; black interior; four radio speakers with pre-wiring for a radio\u2014but no radio itself. Safety features include six airbags, active front head restraints, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and keyless entry are offered as part of a value package. Anti-lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist are optional ($250) on top of the value package.\nWhen it was introduced in fall 2008, the Versa's base price of US$9,990 made it the least expensive new car available in the United States, but a price cut to the Hyundai Accent usurped that distinction by $20. The Versa 1.6's $12,498 Canadian base price also undercut its competitors at launch.\n2010 models featured a redesigned grille and a new design for the 1.8S model's wheel covers. In North America, the sedan was replaced by its second generation starting the 2012 model year (hence, 2011 being its last). The fate of the hatchback was however extended for one more year, 2012 being its last. Production of both for that market stopped in mid-2011.\nThe Tiida sedan was discontinued in Mexico. It was since been replaced by the new Versa in October 2019.\n\nSouth AmericaOn 11 January 2008, Chrysler LLC and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Chrysler with a new car based on Nissan Versa sedan for limited distribution in South America in 2009.\n\n\n=== Electric prototype ===\n\nThe EV-11 prototype electric car was based on Tiida and used an 80 kW (107 hp) and 280 N\u22c5m (207 lb\u22c5ft) electric motor, 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack rated 160 km (99 mi) distance, navigation system, EV remote control and monitoring.\n\nThe prototype vehicle was unveiled in Nissan's Yokohama headquarters on 8 February 2009. Production version was set to begin sale in US and Japan in 2010.\n\n\n== Second generation (C12; 2011) ==\n\nThe second generation, C12 series of the Nissan Tiida was unveiled in April 2011 at the Shanghai Auto Show. Sales in China commenced in June 2011. It is available only as a five-door hatchback, and is notably not sold in Japan. The C11 Tiida sedan was instead replaced by the Nissan Latio (N17) and Nissan Sylphy (B17). The C12 Tiida is in fact heavily related to the Sylphy B17\u2014both base their construction on the Nissan V platform and share substantial mechanicals. The Thai manufactured versions even share the Sylphy B17's interior; the original Chinese and Taiwanese models feature a distinctive design. Powertrains also remain common between C12 and B17 models.\nInstead of being sized and marketed as both a subcompact or a compact car depending on the country, the new, noticeably larger Tiida will be marketed as a C-segment worldwide as the March/Micra and Latio will take the place of the B-segment markets.It is available with the 188 hp turbocharged 1.6-litre petrol engine, with gasoline direct injection paired with a continuously variable transmission. Other engines will be announced closer to the release date.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nAsiaIn Thailand, the Tiida hatchback is called the Nissan Pulsar, which went on sale by February 2013. The Tiida hatchback comes with MRA8DE, which it shares with the Nissan Sylphy. In Taiwan, the Tiida hatchback is known as the Big Tiida in advertisement due to the size upgrade and went on sale in January 2013.\n\nAustraliaIn Australia, the Tiida name was dropped in favour of a return to using Nissan Pulsar, which was a very popular nameplate up to 2005.The SSS high performance version with a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine arrived in late 2013. It was aimed at the \"warm\" hatch market which is a category placed between standard and hot hatches. It featured a 140 kilowatt turbocharged MR16DDT engine found in the Nissan Pulsar ST-S variant. It is also found in the Nissan Juke ST-S and TI-S. The engine was connected to either a close ratio 6 speed manual gearbox or Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) automatic. Premium features included push start ignition, keyless entry, dusk sensing headlights, dual climate control and satellite navigation.\n\nMiddle EastIn the Middle East, the Tiida was available with a 1.6 or 1.8-litre engine.\n\n\n=== iTiida ===\nInstead of updating to the C13 Tiida/Pulsar, the C12 Tiida was facelifted exclusively in the Taiwanese market conducted by Yulon Motors. The facelift was a budget update to keep the appearance of the C12 Tiida in Taiwan in line with the C13 Tiida in other markets. The facelift replaces the front and rear light units with redesigned set up and light strips, front and rear bumpers, and the front grille. The new front grille features the updated Nissan V motion styling and the rear bumper was designed to mimic those on the C13 Tiida.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Third generation (C13; 2015) ==\n\nSince March 2015, the Nissan Pulsar (C13), as sold in most of Europe, is sold in Russia and China under the Tiida nameplate.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nissan Tiida at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Yokohama (Japanese: \u6a2a\u6d5c, pronounced [jokohama] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Japan by population, and the most populous municipality of Japan. It is the capital city of Kanagawa Prefecture. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kant\u014d region of the main island of Honshu. It is a major commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area.\nYokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nYokohama (\u6a2a\u6d5c) literally means \"horizontal beach\". The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the \u014coka River and the Nakamura River had been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a \"horizontal beach\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening of the Treaty Port (1859\u20131868) ===\nYokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners. A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853\u201354, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.It was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the bustling town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the T\u014dkaid\u014d for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.Yokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English speaking residents as The Bluff.\nKannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, inside the barrier), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound.  Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.\nTo protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city. Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan's first English language newspaper, the Japan Herald published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream and beer to be produced in Japan.  Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863 and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866 and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly \u2013 attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji and Taisho Periods (1868\u20131923) ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan's first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan's first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel Around the World in Eighty Days, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.\nIn 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city's first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal-burning plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889. By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.\nThe early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Great Kanto earthquake and the Second World War (1923\u20131945) ===\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923 by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170. Fuelled by rumours of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum. Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake. Martial law was in place until November 19. Rubble from the quake was used to reclaim land for parks, the most famous being the Yamashita Park on the waterfront which opened in 1930.\n\nYokohama was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by U.S. air raids during World War II. An estimated seven or eight thousand people were killed in a single morning on May 29, 1945 in what is now known as the Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the city and in just one hour and nine minutes reduced 42% of it to rubble.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II growth ===\nDuring the American occupation, Yokohama was a major transshipment base for American supplies and personnel, especially during the Korean War. After the occupation, most local U.S. naval activity moved from Yokohama to an American base in nearby Yokosuka.\nThe city was designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956.The city's tram and trolleybus system was abolished in 1972, the same year as the opening of the first line of Yokohama Municipal Subway.\nConstruction of Minato Mirai 21 (\"Port Future 21\"), a major urban development project on reclaimed land, started in 1983.  Minato Mirai 21 hosted the Yokohama Exotic Showcase in 1989, which saw the first public operation of maglev trains in Japan and the opening of Cosmo Clock 21, then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. The 860m-long Yokohama Bay Bridge opened in the same year.\nIn 1993, Minato Mirai saw the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup final was held in June at the International Stadium Yokohama.\nIn 2009, the city marked the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration.  An early part in the commemoration project incorporated the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) which was held in Yokohama in May 2008.\nIn November 2010, Yokohama hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nThese municipalities surround Yokohama.\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nKawasaki\nYokosuka\nZushi\nKamakura\nFujisawa\nYamatoTokyo\n\nMachida\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nYokohama features a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) with hot and humid summers and chilly winters.

        "wiki": "The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007. It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.\n\nThe GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or R35 for short (where CBA stands for the emissions standard prefix), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.\nThe GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla, originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.\n\n\n=== Concepts ===\n\nNissan showed two GT-R concept cars at motor shows before it unveiled the production model: one at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001, to preview a 21st-century GT-R; and a redesigned one, dubbed GT-R Proto, at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show. Officials said the production GT-R would be 80 to 90% based on the second concept.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Production model ===\nThe production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as the 2009 model year, with a lap time of 7:38 minutes at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife beating the all time sports classic Porsche 911 Turbo as Nissan stated before launching the car. The GT-R launched in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine. The cars are built at their Tochigi plant on a shared production line.\n\n\n==== Design ====\n\nNissan chief creative officer, Shir\u014d Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series. Nakamura stated: \"The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car; it had to really reflect Japanese culture.\"\nNissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline.Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.\n\n\n===== Nissan PM platform =====\nAs of 2014 the GT-R was the only model built on Nissan's Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture introduced on the 2001 (V35) Skyline. It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs similar to those used in race car construction. Alcoa aluminium is used for the hood, trunk lid and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminium front shock towers and inner door structures. Outer body panels are stamped using multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front crossmember/radiator support.\n\n\n===== Exterior =====\nNissan developed a 6-stage paint process with double clear coat and chip-resistant paint for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.\n\n\n===== Optional features =====\nThe Premium trim for the GT-R has a body-coloured rear spoiler whereas the Black Edition has a dry carbon-fibre rear spoiler. Both the Premium and Black Edition models are fitted with (LED) headlights, automatic on/off headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights and brake lights, dual heated body-colour power wing mirrors, power folding wing mirrors, flush-mounted aluminium door handles, four 5-inch exhaust outlets with polished tips and UV-reducing solar glass.\n\n\n==== Specifications ====\n\nThe Nissan GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT V6 engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) DOHC V6 with plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima (IHI) turbochargers provide forced induction. Models manufactured between 2007 and 2009 are rated at a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 358 kW (487 PS; 480 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 583 N\u22c5m (430 lb\u22c5ft) at 3,200\u20135,200 rpm. The engine also meets California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. The standard GT-R and the NISMO GT-R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.27.A curb weight of 1,724 kg (3,800 lb) with side curtain airbags is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminium used for the hood, trunk, and doors. A rear mounted six-speed BorgWarner designed dual clutch semi-automatic transmission built by Aichi Machine Industry shifting gears in just 0.2 seconds is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system to provide power to all four wheels, along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC-R) to aid in stability. Three shift modes can also be selected for various conditions. The Nissan GT-R features four-wheel 15\" floating disc Brembo brakes with monoblock calipers (six-piston on the front; four-piston on the rear).\n\n\n==== 2011 facelift ====\n\nThe revised GT-R features an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 406 kW (552 PS; 544 hp) and 612 N\u22c5m (451 lb\u22c5ft) of torque from 3,200 to 6,000 rpm. Changes also include a new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. The new model is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment features and USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.\n\n\n==== 2017 facelift ====\n\nThe updated Nissan GT-R has the same twin-turbocharged 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) V6 VR38DETT engine. but increased the engine output to (419 kW (570 PS; 562 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 633 N\u22c5m (467 lbf\u22c5ft) at 3,200\u20135,800 rpm). The transmission system is also refined to shift the gears quicker than before.\nOther updates include a new front and rear end, bumpers design have been added to improve air cooling system and aerodynamics, new leather has been added to whole interior with a new steering wheel, new infotainment systems and redesigned centre console, new 20-inch aluminium forged wheels, new suspension system, new titanium exhaust system, and new braking systems were added to newly updated GT-R.\n\n\n== Models ==\n\n\n=== SpecV ===\n\nNissan introduced the GT-R SpecV on January 7, 2009 at the 2009 Tokyo Auto Salon. This version uses carbon fibre trim inside and out, and has no rear seats.

On Mardenborough's fastest lap which took 1:17.47 minutes, the car averaged 122 km/h and reached a top speed of 211 km/h.\nThe GT-R/C is fitted with four robots that operate the steering, transmission, brakes and throttle. Six computers mounted in the rear of the car update the controls at up to 100 times a second.\nThe unmodified DualShock 4 connects to a micro-computer that interprets the joystick and button signals and transmits them to the cars's onboard systems. The wireless operation has a primary control range of one kilometer.\nTo help Mardenborough judge the vehicle's speed through the corners, a Racelogic VBOX Motorsport sensor was installed to relay speed data to a LCD display in the helicopter cockpit.\nThe GT-R/C is also fitted with two independent safety systems operating on different radio frequencies in order to allow two additional operators to apply full ABS braking and cut the engine in the event of the main operator losing control of the vehicle.\nIn 2018, the Nissan GT-R/C will be used in a tour of primary and secondary schools in the UK to promote future careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects.\n\n\n== Performance ==\n\nNissan states the GT-R can attain a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph) and Motor Trend recorded a top speed of 313.8 km/h (195.0 mph). In tests the original production model was shown to be capable of achieving 0-97 km/h (60 mph) times as low as 3.2 seconds using \"launch control\". Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term \"launch control\", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle dynamic control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4,500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that \"we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'\". The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.The updated GT-R now has a launch mode called \"R-Mode Start\". Pushing the three buttons up, includes the Transmission, Suspension and VDC the car gets to \"R-Mode Start\". The system allows a maximum of 4 consecutive hard launches before locking itself out, after which it can be unlocked by driving normally for 2.4 km (1.5 mi). The increased engine output of later models combined with the \"R-Mode Start\" has lowered the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) time to 3.2 seconds. Motor Trend achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.6 seconds at 190 km/h (120 mph) using a US-spec 2009 model year GT-R. Autocar achieved a 0-160 km/h (100 mph) time of 8.5 seconds.The 2017 model year GT-R can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in the same time of 2.7 seconds and achieve a 400 m (1\u20444 mi) time of 10.7 seconds at 204 km/h (127 mph). In 2017, the German car magazine Auto Bild tested the top speed of the 2017 model year GT-R and reached a top speed of 328 km/h (204 mph).\n\n\n=== Independent lap times ===\nTesting by Drivers Republic of a GT-R and 911 GT2 in stock form resulted in times of 7:56 minutes for the GT-R and 7:49 minutes for the GT2 respectively in partially damp conditions. While the tester had no doubt that the GT2 could achieve the factory time of 7:32 minutes, he couldn't imagine the customer GT-R going faster than 7:41 minutes in spite of the 7:29 minutes of factory claim.The German magazine sport auto achieved a time of 7:50 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a car supplied to them by Nissan during an initial short test in 2007 in partially damp condition. In 2009, in a full \"super test\" sport auto achieved a time of 7:38 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma, identical to a later \"super test\" Corvette ZR1 time. In a first test with the facelifted GT-R model, sport auto recorded a lap time of 7:34 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma.The sport auto magazine tested the 2007 model year GT-R on the Hockenheimring circuit and recorded a lap time of 1:10.7 minutes during the \"supertest\".\n\n\n=== Nissan's N\u00fcrburgring lap times ===\nIn 2009 Nissan claimed a lap time of 7:26.7 minutes with a 2009 model year GT-R on the base model's Dunlop tires having previously set a time of 7:29 minutes on standard Japanese market tires. Porsche has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. Porsche claimed to have conducted a test of a factory stock, European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54 minutes), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissan's. Nissan disputed the former and implied the latter claim in October 2008.In September 2010, Nissan's sets a N\u00fcrburgring lap time using the 2011 model year GT-R with a new design. Driven by GT-R's development driver Toshio Suzuki. and the car set a lap time of 7:24.22 minutes.\nAccording to Nissan, the GT-R improved its N\u00fcrburgring lap time in October 2012 to 7:19.1 minutes by due to the 2014 model year improvements. This made it the 9th fastest ever production car around the N\u00fcrburgring at the time. Nissan claimed that it lost half a second in traffic, making a potential lap time of 7:18.6 minutes possible.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\nN\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife\nIn February 2013, Nissan opened the new NISMO headquarters in Yokohama. Nissan's CEO Carlos Ghosn planned to introduce the GT-R NISMO within a year as the leading NISMO brand and attempt a production vehicle lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. On May 18 development began, with Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Noboru Kaneko leading the joint NISMO and Dunlop Tyres effort to set the production vehicle lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring.\nOn June 26, the team started testing with standard GT-R's at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway. On July 16, the team visited the N\u00fcrburgring and collected data to aid development, and the team build the GT-R NISMO and its aerodynamic development was finalized after testing it at the Sendai Raceway on July 24.\nOn September 2, the team returned to the N\u00fcrburgring with three GT-R NISMO cars and four drivers with two laps for each driver. drivers included Infiniti Red Bull Racing third driver S\u00e9bastien Buemi, NISMO global brand ambassador and racer Michael Krumm, German touring car driver Armin Hahne, and a Japanese driver, Tetsuya Tanaka. team stopped all the tests of GT-R NISMO and on September 30, the team was aiming for a lap under 7:10 minutes, Armin Hahne and Tetsuya Tanaka didn't get close to the target record but S\u00e9bastien Buemi did a lap time of 7:12 minutes on his first lap, on his second lap he stopped to take some fuel out to reduce the weight. On the way to do a lap time under 7:10 minutes the car ran out of fuel. Michael Krumm did his first lap time of 7:10 minutes.\nAt 4:48 p.m just twelve minutes before the Nordschleife was scheduled to close, and five minutes before the rain, Michael Krumm did his second lap time of 7:08.679 minutes and achieved a peak speed of 310 km/h (193 mph) on the Dottinger Hohe uphill climb, Nissan claimed it was the fastest road-legal volume production vehicle, and it was 11 seconds slower than the production vehicle lap record holder limited production Porsche 918 Spyder Weissach Package's lap time of 6:57 minutes set earlier that month, making it the second fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track.\nAfter setting the lap time, the NISMO team invited the Car and Driver journalist Tony Quiroga to attempt the fastest lap time with a passenger at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. Michael Krumm drove the GT-R NISMO with the journalist and set a lap record for fastest production vehicle with a passenger around the track with a lap time of 7:19.46 minutes with a peak speed of 303 km/h (188 mph) on the Dottinger Hohe uphill climb.\nGoodwood Hill Climb\nIn June 2014, the Nissan GT-R NISMO was revealed at the Goodwood Festival.

The race car is upgraded to a VK45DE 4.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 instead of the twin-turbocharged VR38DETT V6 engine. It uses a 6 speed sequential manual gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race car.\n\nA prototype was spotted testing around the Suzuka Circuit as well as Fuji Speedway in Japan. The car went on to win the opening race of the 2008 Super GT season at Suzuka scoring a one-two finish for Nissan. In race two, the GT-Rs repeated their 1\u20132 result. It won the drivers' championship in the 2008 season through the Xanavi NISMO GT-R driven by Satoshi Motoyama and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer, although they only came third in the teams' championship. It also won 7 out of 9 races by 4 different teams using GT-Rs.The GT500 version scored 4 victories in the 2009 Japanese SUPER GT Series GT 500 class.\nIn 2010, the VK45DE 4.5-litre engine was replaced by a newly developed 3.4-litre engine (VRH34A).In 2011 and 2012, Team Mola GT-R with drivers Ronnie Quintarelli and Masataka Yanagida got back to back championships in both teams' and drivers' classifications in the Super GT500 class.In 2014, the Super GT regulations were aligned with those of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, and so the V8 engine was replaced with a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbocharged engine.\n\n\n=== FIA GT/GT1 World Championship ===\n\nOn February 27, 2009, NISMO announced a partnership with British racing team Gigawave Motorsports to enter a GT-R in four races in the 2009 FIA GT Championship season. The entry did not compete for championship points, but was used by NISMO to refine the performance of the GT-R for future customer teams to use the car in the planned FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010. NISMO driver Michael Krumm and Gigawave driver Darren Turner would co-drive the GT1 GT-R.The Sumo Power GT-R won the 2010 RAC Tourist Trophy at Silverstone Circuit as part of the FIA GT1 World Championship on May 2, 2010.\nThe 2011 season saw Swiss Racing Team switch to Lamborghini which left Sumo Power running four GT-Rs, two under the Sumo Power GT name and two under JR Motorsports.\nJR Motorsports with the drivers Michael Krumm and Lucas Luhr won the Drivers Championship for the 2011 season, gaining 3 wins and 1 pole position in 10 races. The team got the second place in the teams championship because in the last race the No.23 car retired from a crash and the No.22 car had a penalty when leading in first place of the race and finished at 8th. End of the race team behind by just 3 points by the team champions.\n\n\n==== GT-R Nismo GT1 ====\n\nDesigned and produced specifically to compete in the FIA GT1 World Championship, the GT-R NISMO GT1 is based on the road-going version of the Nissan GT-R. The GT-R NISMO GT1 is powered by a NISMO race-prepped VK56DE, a naturally aspirated V8 engine that displaces 5,552 cc.

The NISMO team returned to the Mount Panorama Circuit for the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour where after qualifying a disappointing 13th, Chiyo, Strauss and Nissan Australia's Rick Kelly finished in second place, only 1.2 seconds behind the race winning McLaren 650S GT3 from Tekno Autosports. The NISMO Athlete Global Team led the most number of laps in the race having led for 107 of the 297 laps run.In addition, a GT-R GT3 won the Pro-Am cup championship at the 2013 Blancpain Endurance Series. but in two years later Nissan GT Academy won the championship at the 2015 Blancpain Endurance Series. and also it won the Super Taiku Series and Super GT for several times respectively.\nIn 2016, it won in all six races for the Super Endurance Series, easily winning the series championship. At the Total 24 Hours of Spa, the car finished all the races consecutively 4 years in a row between 2014 and 2017, as well as finishing 24 Hours Nurburgring consecutively between 2014 and 2016.\n\n\n=== Other categories ===\nA production-based GT-R made its world motorsport debut in Australia's Targa Tasmania tarmac rally in April 2008, however it sustained damage early in the event and did not complete the rally. Later in 2008 a GT-R won the Competition Modern class in the Targa West before returning to Targa Tasmania in 2009 to take the outright win in the Modern class. In 2009 Nissan's GT-R won the One Lap of America competition. In 2010 the GT-R finished 2nd over all in the One Lap of America competition.\nDuring the 2010 SCCA World Challenge season, a pair of GT class GT-Rs were campaigned by Brass Monkey Racing and driven by Steve Ott and Tony Rivera.On June 4, 2010, NISMO announced a Club Track Edition GT-R available via its Nissan supported Omori aftermarket factory. This domestic market trim is a non-street legal, race-ready variant equipped with a 6-point roll cage and upgraded with NISMO race package developed through its Tokachi endurance racer program.\n\nOn June 25 and 26, 2011, the No. 71 Schulze Motorsport Nissan GT-R took part in the 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring 2011 driven by Michael Schulze, Tobias Schulze, Kazunori Yamauchi and Yasuyoshi Yamamoto. The car finished the race in 36th place overall, achieving a victory in the SP 8T class after overcoming several technical problems. It was the first time a Nissan GT-R took part in the 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring. In the following year, Nissan participated the SP8T class with 2 Club Track Edition GT-Rs as works team, which driven by Team Nissan and Team GT Academy, both cars completed the race in 99th and 30th in overall respectively \u2013 through they are the only entries in SP-8T class that year.\n\n\n== Aftermarket tuning ==\n\n\n=== Tuning ===\nDespite early concerns about the difficulty of modifying the Nissan GT-R, many aftermarket tuning parts have become available. The previously reported \"untuneable\" ECU has since been hacked by several tuning houses.\nCOBB Tuning was the first company to access the GT-R's encrypted ECU. With their AccessPORT anyone can reprogram both the engine and transmission control units with off the shelf or custom maps. Mine's also has limited control of the ECU, and others (MCR, HKS, and Top Secret) have bypassed the unit. They have been seen testing modified GT-Rs with the former two having conducted tests at the Tsukuba Circuit.Ecutek tuning on the other hand was the first company to manipulate and change shift points on the GT-R in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap-around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5.\nOn January 16, 2013, Ecutek also became the first company to construct and offer Flex Fuel hardware and software capability for all Nissan GT-Rs. This fuel kit requires the Ecutek specific TCM. The kit provides changes in the cold start cranking compensation, changes to the maximum target boost, changes in the ignition timing, changes to target airflow, changes in cam timing, and changes in the fuel economy gauge reading all based solely on ethanol content in the gas tank.Japan based tuner Mine's has created the VR38DETT super response engine which uses lightened engine internals like titanium rods, lightened pistons and many other components that allow the engine to rev more quickly, it makes 588 kW; 789 hp; 800 PS.AMS Performance, Alpha Logic Performance and Extreme Turbo Systems all build drag cars and aftermarket tuner parts for the Nissan GT-R.\nIn a review by Motor Trend editor Scott Kanemura, it was revealed that the GPS system fitted to the GT-R would remove the 180 km/h (112 mph) speed limiter when the car arrives at a race track, but only on tracks approved by Nissan. Aftermarket ECUs have been developed to bypass the speed limiter, in addition to stand-alone speed-limiter defeaters. The GPS check will not be implemented in American models.In August 2008, Nissan's official motorsport and tuning arm NISMO announced the \"Club Sport\" tuning package for the GT-R . The package, which is also fitted to the SpecV, includes Bilstein Damptronic compatible dampers, 20\" forged aluminum wheels from RAYS Engineering, Bridgestone run-flat tires, Recaro carbon fiber-shelled bucket seats, a titanium exhaust, and a revised rear diffuser with an added cooling duct. The package is supported by a warranty and saves over 20 kg (44 lb).\n\n\n=== Drag Racing ===\nAMS Performance, based in West Chicago Illinois, has set record power levels and performance numbers for the GT-R. Their Alpha Omega GT-R as well as the first GT-R to reach the 9's, 8's, and 7's. In June 2013, OMEGA broke into the 7s when it ran a 7.98 at 299.56 km/h (186.14 mph). During the evening of the 7 second pass Omega broke a couple of other records. Omega bested its previous 97\u2013209 km/h (60\u2013130 mph) time with 2.67 seconds. Omega also broke the 161\u2013241 km/h (100\u2013150 mph) record which was previously held by an Underground Racing TT Gallardo (2.58 seconds) with 2.45 seconds. But in June 2015, the Alpha Omega GT-R get generating over 2050 whp and boasts 0\u201360 mph time of 1.49 seconds. Omega set multiple world records at the WannaGoFast 1/2 Mile Shootout at Built Field Airport in Monee, Illinois which included: 361.8 km/h (224.91 mph) in a standing 1/2 mile; 97\u2013209 km/h (60\u2013130 mph) time in 2.28 seconds; 0\u2013161 km/h (0\u2013100 mph) in 2.78 seconds; 0\u2013300 km/h (0\u2013186 mph) in 7.07 seconds; 0\u2013322 km/h (0\u2013200 mph) in 10.49 seconds. the Alpha Omega GT-R did its best of quarter-mile time in 7.49 seconds at 310 km/h (193 mph). making it the quickest and fastest GT-R and road-legal vehicle in the world. and the car won the King Of The Streets competition two times in the row. The AMS Performance Alpha Omega package functions more as a shop/research and development vehicle which is the reason why it is not available to the general public. However, anybody can purchase the Alpha 6, Alpha 9, Alpha 10, Alpha 12, Alpha 14, Alpha 16 and Alpha X packages; each respectively with approximately 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1,400, 1,600, 2,200 wheel horsepower when installed and tuned.In 2017 AMS Performance build a GT-R calls Alpha-G GT-R and the car will be the first Nissan GT-R to do a quarter mile in 6 seconds. Car ran it from 6.937 seconds driven by Gidi Chamdi with a trap speed of 315.36 km/h (196 mph) and held the fastest AWD record. But Later ETS (Extreme Turbo Systems) GT-R broke the record with a 6.88 seconds of quarter mile pass at 358.80 km/h (223 mph). And it became as the world's fastest car at a standing half mile with trap speed of 410.29 km/h (255 mph).In December 2018, the Alpha Logic Performance from Dubai set the quarter-mile record for fastest GT-R and fastest AWD using their \"Panda\" GT-R in 6.582 seconds at 373.82 km/h (232.28 mph).But in 2019 Import vs Domestic finals the 3500 whp and 100 PSI of boost ETS-G GT-R broke the quickest and fastest GT-R, AWD and  Stock Unibody world record. Car ran the 1/4 mile in 6.56 seconds and a trap speed of 362.02 km/h (225 mph). And won the competition by beating the Alpha Queen GT-R which is ran a 6.87 second quarter mile.\n\nAt the Dragtimes Competition, Russia, the AMS Alpha 12 GT-R broke the fastest road-legal standing 1 mile record driven by Jury with a trap speed of 382 km/h (237 mph) but later the record broken by a 2500 whp Ford GT. Later in the same competition, Switzer Goliath GT-R broke the quickest road-legal standing 1 mile record in 22.602 seconds with a trap speed of 402 km/h (250 mph).\n\n\n=== Time Attack ===\nModified Nissan GT-Rs have competed in time attack challenges, specially for WTAC (World Time Attack Challenge). Time attack GT-Rs have been fielded by HKS, Precision Automotive Racing and LYFE.\nIn 2015, the HKS GT-R became as the fastest time attack GT-R, it has the same VR38DETT engine generating over 1200 whp. It became the fastest vehicle at Fontana, California, Fuji Speedway (with a peak speed of over 322 km/h (200 mph) and in Sydney Motorsport Park. the car compete at the 2015 WTAC and won the GT-R R35 class with a fastest lap record of 1:30.838 minutes. But in 2017, LYFE's 1136 whp GT-R broke all HKS's records and won the title as fastest time attack GT-R at the WTAC.In 2017 WTAC, Precision Automotive Racing's GT-R, driven by Aaron McGranahan, set a peak speed of 269 km/h (167 mph) and won the Flying 500 class title.\n\n\n=== Hill Climb ===\nThe Nissan GT-R has competed in both stock and modified forms in many hill climbing competitions, such as the Jaguar Simola Hill Climb in South Africa.\nAt the 2019 Jaguar Simola Hill Climb, the Nissan GT-R was named the most successful supercar. In the final Top 10 Shootout event, Kyle Mitchell won the event, setting a time of 40.862 seconds and becoming the fastest road-legal vehicle.\n\n\n=== Drifting ===\nIn February 2016, using a modified GT-R NISMO, Masato Kawabata set a new world record for the fastest 30-degree drift at approximately 304 km/h at the Fujairah International Airport.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Nissan GT-R played a main role in Fast & Furious 6. The car in the widely successful movie has modified bumpers, new vented hood, modified fenders, side sills, carbon doors, carbon roof, and carbon spoilers.\nOn the August 13, 2014, Mike Newman broke the record for the 'fastest speed for a car driven blindfolded' in a Nissan GT-R modified by Litchfield Motors (UK).\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\n\n== Sales ==\nFrom 2007 to 2017 Nissan produced over 37,315 GT-R units and sold for different markets. This makes it the most sold Nissan sports car and one of the highest sales for any production sports car. These are the sales figures for July, 2020.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Statistics by US model year ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Nissan GT-R has appeared in numerous video games, including the Initial D Arcade Stage, Initial D, Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, Sega GT, Assetto Corsa, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, Need for Speed, Midnight Club,Wangan Midnight, Asphalt and Forza Horizon.\nThe GT-R also appeared in The Fast And The Furious movie franchise as Paul Walker's Brian O' Conner's vehicle.

        "wiki": "Minato Mirai 21 (\u307f\u306a\u3068\u307f\u3089\u304421, Minato Mirai Nij\u016bichi), often known as simply Minato Mirai and abbreviated as MM, is the central business district of Yokohama, Japan. Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nThe area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.\nMinato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at \u014csanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMajor attractions in the area include:\n\nYokohama Landmark Tower - the second-tallest building and fourth-tallest structure in Japan, with sweeping views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji\nCosmo World amusement park \u2014 includes the 100-metre (328 ft) tall Cosmo Clock 21, formerly the world's tallest Ferris wheel\nKishamichi Promenade - a pedestrian walkway that follows the original harbor railroad tracks, linking Sakuragich\u014d Station with Yokohama World Porters and the Cosmo Clock, and offering expansive views of the Minato Mirai skyline\nMinato Mirai Hall - concert hall home to the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra\nPacifico Yokohama\nNippon Maru - a four masted sailing ship, permanently docked on the harbor at Minato Mirai as a museum\nYokohama Museum of Art\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nQueen's Square Yokohama (Official website)\n\n\n== Major hotels ==\nMajor hotels in the area with over 300 guestrooms include:\n\nYokohama Bay Grand InterContinental Hotel\nPan Pacific Yokohama Bay Hotel Tokyu\nYokohama Royal Park Hotel\nYokohama Sakuragicho Washington Hotel\nYokohama Bay Sheraton Hotel and towers\n\n\n== Railway stations ==\nMinatomirai Station\nSakuragich\u014d Station\nShin-Takashima Station\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nThe area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.\nMinato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at \u014csanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMajor attractions in the area include:\n\nYokohama Landmark Tower - the second-tallest building and fourth-tallest structure in Japan, with sweeping views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji\nCosmo World amusement park \u2014 includes the 100-metre (328 ft) tall Cosmo Clock 21, formerly the world's tallest Ferris wheel\nKishamichi Promenade - a pedestrian walkway that follows the original harbor railroad tracks, linking Sakuragich\u014d Station with Yokohama World Porters and the Cosmo Clock, and offering expansive views of the Minato Mirai skyline\nMinato Mirai Hall - concert hall home to the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra\nPacifico Yokohama\nNippon Maru - a four masted sailing ship, permanently docked on the harbor at Minato Mirai as a museum\nYokohama Museum of Art\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nQueen's Square Yokohama (Official website)\n\n\n== Major hotels ==\nMajor hotels in the area with over 300 guestrooms include:\n\nYokohama Bay Grand InterContinental Hotel\nPan Pacific Yokohama Bay Hotel Tokyu\nYokohama Royal Park Hotel\nYokohama Sakuragicho Washington Hotel\nYokohama Bay Sheraton Hotel and towers\n\n\n== Railway stations ==\nMinatomirai Station\nSakuragich\u014d Station\nShin-Takashima Station\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

Band\u014d is the old name for what is now the Kant\u014d region, used in this case because the temples are all in the Prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama, Tokyo, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Chiba. As is the case with all such circuits, each location has a rank, and pilgrims believe that visiting them all in order is an act of great religious merit.Started by Minamoto no Yoritomo and his son Sanetomo, the Band\u014d Sanj\u016bsankasho is just one of 70 different Kannon pilgrimage circuits existing in Japan, each including 33 temples because the Goddess is believed to have 33 different manifestations. Sugimoto-dera in Kamakura is number one, Zushi's Gandenji's is number two, An'y\u014d-in in Kamakura is the number three, the famous Hasedera in Hase number four, and so on. From its beginning at Sugimotodera to its end in Chiba's Nagodera, the circuit is over 1300 km long. Even though women were allowed to pray at individual temples, the circuit was originally reserved to male pilgrims. Now however most of the pilgrims are women. Pilgrims leave behind a slip of paper  or a sticker as a proof of their visit, and many of these can be seen plastered on temple walls and pillars.\n\n\n== The 33 temples of the Band\u014d Sanj\u016bsankasho circuit ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapan 100 Kannon, pilgrimage composed of the Saigoku, Band\u014d and Chichibu pilgrimages.\nSaigoku 33 Kannon, pilgrimage in the Kansai region.\nChichibu 34 Kannon, pilgrimage in Saitama Prefecture.\nShikoku Pilgrimage, 88 Temple pilgrimage in the Shikoku island.\nCh\u016bgoku 33 Kannon, pilgrimage in the Ch\u016bgoku region.\nKannon\nBuddhism in Japan\nTourism in Japan\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDonald Richie.

        "wiki": "Kamakura (\u938c\u5009\u5e02, Kamakura-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. \nKamakura has an estimated population of 172,302 (1 September 2016) and a population density of 4,358.77 persons per km2 over the total area of 39.53 km2 (15.26 sq mi). Kamakura was designated as a city on 3 November 1939.\nKamakura was the de facto capital of Japan from 1185 to 1333 as the seat of the Kamakura Shogunate, and became the nation's most populous settlement from 1200 to 1300 during the Kamakura period. Kamakura is a popular domestic tourist destination in Japan as a coastal city with a high number of seasonal festivals, as well as ancient Buddhist and Shinto shrines and temples.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSurrounded to the north, east, and west by hills and to the south by the open water of Sagami Bay, Kamakura is a natural fortress. Before the construction of several tunnels and modern roads that now connect it to Fujisawa, Ofuna (ja) and Zushi, on land it could be entered only through narrow artificial passes, among which the seven most important were called Kamakura's Seven Entrances (\u938c\u5009\u4e03\u53e3), a name sometimes translated as \"Kamakura's Seven Mouths\". The natural fortification made Kamakura an easily defensible stronghold.Before the opening of the Entrances, access on land was so difficult that the Azuma Kagami reports that H\u014dj\u014d Masako came back to Kamakura from a visit to S\u014dt\u014dzan temple in Izu bypassing by boat the impassable Inamuragasaki cape and arriving in Yuigahama. Again according to the Azuma Kagami, the first of the Kamakura sh\u014dguns, Minamoto no Yoritomo, chose it as a base partly because it was his ancestors' land (his yukari no chi), partly because of these physical characteristics.To the north of the city stands Mt. Genji (Genjiyama) (\u6e90\u6c0f\u5c71) (92 m or 302 ft), which then passes behind the Daibutsu and reaches Inamuragasaki and the sea.From the north to the east, Kamakura is surrounded by Mt. Rokkokuken (\u516d\u56fd\u898b) (147 m or 482 ft), Mt. \u014chira (\u5927\u5e73\u5c71) (159 m or 522 ft), Mt. Jubu (\u9df2\u5cf0\u5c71) (127 m or 417 ft), Mt. Tendai (\u5929\u53f0\u5c71)(141 m or 463 ft), and Mt. Kinubari (\u8863\u5f35\u5c71) (120 m or 390 ft), which extend all the way to Iijimagasaki and Wakae Island, on the border with Kotsubo and Zushi. From Kamakura's alluvional plain branch off numerous narrow valleys like the Urigayatsu, Shakad\u014dgayatsu, \u014cgigayatsu, Kamegayatsu, Hikigayatsu, and Matsubagayatsu valleys. (The ending \"\u30f6\u8c37\" meaning \"valley\", common in place names and usually read \"-gaya\", in Kamakura is pronounced \"-gayatsu\").\nKamakura is crossed by the Namerigawa river, which goes from the Asaina Pass in northern Kamakura to the beach in Yuigahama for a total length of about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi). The river marks the border between Zaimokuza and Yuigahama.\nIn administrative terms, the municipality of Kamakura borders with Yokohama to the north, with Zushi to the east, and with Fujisawa to the west. It includes many areas outside the Seven Entrances as Yamanouchi, Koshigoe (\u8170\u8d8a), Shichirigahama, and Ofuna (ja), and is the result of the fusion of Kamakura proper with the cities of Koshigoe, absorbed in 1939, Ofuna, absorbed in 1948, and with the village of Fukasawa, absorbed in 1948.\n\n\n=== Kita-Kamakura (Yamanouchi) ===\n\nNorthwest of Kamakura lies Yamanouchi, commonly called Kita-Kamakura because of the presence of East Japan Railway Company's (JR) Kita-Kamakura Station. Yamanouchi, however, was technically never a part of historical Kamakura since it is outside the Seven Entrances. Yamanouchi was the northern border of the city during the shogunate, and the important Kobukorozaka and Kamegayatsu Passes, two of Kamakura's Seven Entrances, led directly to it. Its name at the time used to be Sakado-g\u014d (\u5c3a\u5ea6\u90f7). The border post used to lie about a hundred meters past today's Kita-Kamakura train station in Ofuna's direction.Although very small, Yamanouchi is famous for its traditional atmosphere and the presence, among others, of three of the five highest-ranking Rinzai Zen temples in Kamakura, the Kamakura Gozan (\u938c\u5009\u4e94\u5c71). These three great temples were built here because Yamanouchi was the home territory of the H\u014dj\u014d clan, a branch of the Taira clan which ruled Japan for 150 years. Among Kita-Kamakura's most illustrious citizens were artist Isamu Noguchi and movie director Yasujir\u014d Ozu. Ozu is buried at Engaku-ji.\n\n\n== Wakamiya \u014cji and the shogunate's six avenues ==\n\nKamakura's defining feature is Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, a Shinto shrine in the center of the city. A 1.8-kilometre (1.1 mi) road (\u53c2\u9053, sand\u014d) runs from Sagami Bay directly to the shrine. This road is known as Wakamiya \u014cji, the city's main street. Built by Minamoto no Yoritomo as an imitation of Kyoto's Suzaku \u014cji, Wakamiya \u014cji used to be much wider, delimited on both sides by a 3 metre deep canal and flanked by pine trees.Walking from the beach toward the shrine, one passes through three torii, or Shinto gates, called respectively Ichi no Torii (first gate), Ni no Torii (second gate) and San no Torii (third gate). Between the first and the second lies Geba Yotsukado which, as the name indicates, was the place where riders had to get off their horses in deference to Hachiman and his shrine.Approximately 100 metres after the second torii, the dankazura, a raised pathway flanked by cherry trees that marks the center of Kamakura, begins. The dankazura becomes gradually wider so that it will look longer than it really is when viewed from the shrine. Its entire length is under the direct administration of the shrine. Minamoto no Yoritomo made his father-in-law H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa and his men carry by hand the stones to build it to pray for the safe delivery of his son Yoriie. The dankazura used to go all the way to Geba, but it was drastically shortened during the 19th century to make way for the newly constructed Yokosuka railroad line.In Kamakura, wide streets are called \u014cji (\u5927\u8def)\u3001narrower ones K\u014dji (\u5c0f\u8def), the small streets that connect the two are called zushi (\u8fbb\u5b50), and intersections tsuji (\u8fbb). Komachi \u014cji and Ima K\u014dji run respectively east and west of Wakamiya \u014cji, while Yoko \u014cji, the road that passes right under San no Torii, and \u014cmachi \u014cji, which goes from Kotsubo to Geba and Hase, run in the east\u2013west direction. Near the remains of Hama no \u014ctorii runs Kuruma \u014cji Avenue (also called Biwa Koji). These six streets (three running north to south and three east to west) were built at the time of the shogunate and are all still under heavy use. The only one to have been modified is Kuruma \u014cji, a segment of which has disappeared.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe earliest traces of human settlements in the area date back at least 10,000 years. Obsidian and stone tools found at excavation sites near J\u014draku-ji were dated to the Old Stone Age (between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago). During the J\u014dmon period, the sea level was higher than now and all the flat land in Kamakura up to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and, further east, up to Yokohama's Totsuka-ku and Sakae-ku was under water. Thus, the oldest pottery fragments found come from hillside settlements of the period between 7500 BC and 5000 BC. In the late J\u014dmon period the sea receded and civilization progressed. During the Yayoi period (300 BC\u2013300 AD), the sea receded further almost to today's coastline, and the economy shifted radically from hunting and fishing to farming.The Azuma Kagami describes pre-shogunate Kamakura as a remote, forlorn place, but there is reason to believe its writers simply wanted to give the impression that prosperity had been brought there by the new regime. To the contrary, it is known that by the Nara period (about 700 AD) there were both temples and shrines. Sugimoto-dera for example was built during this period and is therefore one of the city's oldest temples. The town was also the seat of area government offices and the point of convergence of several land and marine routes. It seems therefore only natural that it should have been a city of a certain importance, likely to attract Yoritomo's attention.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Kamakura appears in the Kojiki of 712, and is also mentioned in the c. 8th century Man'y\u014dsh\u016b as well as in the Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d of 938. However, the city clearly appears in the historical record only with Minamoto no Yoritomo's founding of the Kamakura shogunate in 1192.\nThere are various hypotheses about the origin of the name. According to the most likely theory, Kamakura, surrounded as it is on three sides by mountains, was likened both to a cooking hearth (\u7ac3, kamado, kama) and to a warehouse (\u5009, kura), because both only have one side open.Another and more picturesque explanation is a legend, relating how Fujiwara no Kamatari stopped at Yuigahama on his way to today's Ibaraki Prefecture, where he wanted to pray at the Kashima Shrine for the fall of Soga no Iruka. He dreamed of an old man who promised his support, and upon waking, he found next to his bed a type of spear called a kamayari. Kamatari enshrined it in a place called \u014ckura. Kamayari plus \u014ckura then turned into the name Kamakura. However, this and similar legends appear to have arisen only after Kamatari's descendant Fujiwara no Yoritsune became the fourth sh\u014dgun of the Kamakura shogunate in 1226, some time after the name Kamakura appears in the historical record. It used to be also called Renpu (\u938c\u5e9c) (short for Kamakura Bakufu (\u938c\u5009\u5e55\u5e9c, or Kamakura Shogunate)).\n\n\n=== Kamakura period ===\n\nThe extraordinary events, the historical characters and the culture of the twenty years which go from Minamoto no Yoritomo's birth to the assassination of the last of his sons have been throughout Japanese history the background and the inspiration for countless poems, books, jidaigeki TV dramas, Kabuki plays, songs, manga and even videogames; and are necessary to make sense of much of what one sees in today's Kamakura.\nYoritomo, after the defeat and almost complete extermination of his family at the hands of the Taira clan, managed in the space of a few years to go from being a fugitive hiding from his enemies inside a tree trunk to being the most powerful man in the land. Defeating the Taira clan, Yoritomo became de facto ruler of much of Japan and founder of the Kamakura shogunate, an institution destined to last 141 years and to have immense repercussions over the country's history.\nThe Kamakura shogunate era is called by historians the Kamakura period and, although its end is clearly set (Siege of Kamakura (1333)), its beginning is not.  Different historians put Kamakura's beginning at a different point in time within a range that goes from the establishment of Yoritomo's first military government in Kamakura (1180) to his elevation to the rank of Sei-i Taish\u014dgun (\u5f81\u5937\u5927\u5c06\u8ecd) in 1192. It used to be thought that during this period, effective power had moved completely from the Emperor in Kyoto to Yoritomo in Kamakura, but the progress of research has revealed this was not the case. Even after the consolidation of the shogunate's power in the east, the Emperor continued to rule the country, particularly its west. However, it's undeniable that Kamakura had a certain autonomy and that it had surpassed the technical capital of Japan politically, culturally and economically. The shogunate even reserved for itself an area in Kyoto called Rokuhara (\u516d\u6ce2\u7f85) where lived its representatives, who were there to protect its interests.\n\nIn 1179, Yoritomo married H\u014dj\u014d Masako, an event of far-reaching consequences for Japan.  In 1180, he entered Kamakura, building his residence in a valley called \u014ckura (in today's Nishi Mikado). The stele on the spot (see photo) reads:\n\n737 years ago, in 1180, Minamoto no Yoritomo built his mansion here. Consolidated his power, he later ruled from home, and his government was therefore called \u014ckura Bakufu (\u5927\u8535\u5e55\u5e9c). He was succeeded by his sons Yoriie and Sanetomo, and this place remained the seat of the government for 46 years until 1225, when his wife H\u014dj\u014d Masako died. It was then transferred to Utsunomiya Tsuji (\u5b87\u6d25\u5bae\u8fbb).\nErected in March 1917 by the Kamakurach\u014d Seinendan\n\nIn 1185, his forces, commanded by his younger brother Minamoto no Yoshitsune, vanquished the Taira and in 1192 he received from Emperor Go-Toba the title of Sei-i Taish\u014dgun. Yoshitsune's power would however cause Yoritomo's envy; the relationship between the brothers soured, and in 1189 Yoritomo was given Yoshitsune's head pickled in liquor. For the same reason, in 1193 he had his other brother Noriyori killed. Power was now firmly in his hands, but the Minamoto dynasty and its power however were to end as quickly and unexpectedly as they had started.\nIn 1199, Yoritomo died falling from his horse when he was only 51 and was buried in a temple that had until then housed his tutelary goddess. He was succeeded by his 17-year-old son Minamoto no Yoriie under the regency of his maternal grandfather H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa. A long and bitter fight ensued in which entire clans like the Hatakeyama, the Hiki, and the Wada were wiped out by the H\u014dj\u014d who wished to get rid of Yoritomo's supporters and consolidate their power. Yoriie did become head of the Minamoto clan and was regularly appointed sh\u014dgun in 1202 but by that time, real power had already fallen into the hands of the H\u014dj\u014d clan. Yoriie plotted to take back his power, but failed and was assassinated on July 17, 1204. His six-year-old first son Ichiman had already been killed during political turmoil in Kamakura, while his second son Yoshinari at age six was forced to become a Buddhist priest under the name Kugy\u014d. From then on all power would belong to the H\u014dj\u014d, and the sh\u014dgun would be just a figurehead. Since the H\u014dj\u014d were part of the Taira clan, it can be said that the Taira had lost a battle, but in the end had won the war.\n\nYoritomo's second son and third sh\u014dgun Minamoto no Sanetomo spent most of his life staying out of politics and writing poetry, but was nonetheless assassinated in February 1219 by his nephew Kugy\u014d under the giant ginkgo tree whose trunk still stood at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b until it was uprooted by a storm in the early hours of March 10, 2010. Kugy\u014d himself, the last of his line, was beheaded as a punishment for his crime by the H\u014dj\u014d just hours later. Barely 30 years into the shogunate, the Seiwa Genji dynasty who had created it in Kamakura had ended.In 1293, a severe earthquake killed 23,000 people and seriously damaged the city. In the confusion following the quake, H\u014dj\u014d Sadatoki, the Shikken of the Kamakura shogunate, carried out a purge against his subordinate Taira no Yoritsuna. In what is referred to as the Heizen Gate Incident, Yoritsuna and 90 of his followers were killed.\nThe H\u014dj\u014d regency however continued until Nitta Yoshisada destroyed it in 1333 at the Siege of Kamakura. It was under the regency that Kamakura acquired many of its best and most prestigious temples and shrines, for example Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, Kench\u014d-ji, Engaku-ji, Jufuku-ji, J\u014dchi-ji, and Zeniarai Benten Shrine. The H\u014dj\u014d family crest in the city is therefore still ubiquitous.\nFrom the middle of the thirteenth century, the fact that the vassals (the gokenin) were allowed to become de facto owners of the land they administered, coupled to the custom that all gokenin children could inherit, led to the parcelization of the land and to a consequent weakening of the shogunate. This, and not lack of legitimacy, was the primary cause of the H\u014dj\u014d's fall.\nAccording to The Institute for Research on World-Systems, Kamakura was the 4th largest city in the world in 1250 AD, with 200,000 people, and Japan's largest, eclipsing Kyoto by 1200 AD. Yet, despite Kamakura's annihilation of Kyoto-based political and military power at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185, and the failure of the Emperor to free himself from Kamakura's control during the J\u014dky\u016b War, Takahashi (2005) has questioned whether Kamakura's nationwide political hegemony actually existed. Takahashi claims that if Kamakura ruled the Kant\u014d, not only was the Emperor in fact still the ruler of Kansai, but during this period the city was in many ways politically and administratively still under the ancient capital of Kyoto. Kamakura was simply a rival center of political, economic and cultural power in a country that had Kyoto as its capital.\n\n\n==== Fall of the Kamakura shogunate ====\n\nOn July 3, 1333, warlord Nitta Yoshisada, who was an Emperor loyalist, attacked Kamakura to reestablish imperial rule. After trying to enter by land through the Kewaizaka Pass and the Gokuraku-ji Pass, he and his forces waited for a low tide, bypassed the Inamuragasaki cape, entered the city and took it.In accounts of that disastrous H\u014dj\u014d defeat it is recorded that nearly 900 H\u014dj\u014d samurai, including the last three Regents, committed suicide at their family temple, T\u014dsh\u014d-ji, whose ruins have been found in today's \u014cmachi. Almost the entire clan vanished at once, the city was sacked and many temples were burned. Many simple citizens imitated the H\u014dj\u014d, and an estimated total of over 6,000 died on that day of their own hand. In 1953, 556 skeletons of that period were found during excavations near Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's Ichi no Torii in Yuigahama, all of people who had died of a violent death, probably at the hand of Nitta's forces.\n\n\n=== Muromachi and Edo periods ===\n\nThe fall of Kamakura marks the beginning of an era in Japanese history characterized by chaos and violence called the Muromachi period. Kamakura's decline was slow, and in fact the next phase of its history, in which, as the capital of the Kant\u014d region, it dominated the east of the country, lasted almost as long as the shogunate had. Kamakura would come out of it almost completely destroyed.The situation in Kant\u014d after 1333 continued to be tense, with H\u014dj\u014d supporters staging sporadic revolts here and there. In 1335, H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyuki, son of last regent Takatoki, tried to re-establish the shogunate by force and defeated Kamakura's de facto ruler Ashikaga Tadayoshi in Musashi, in today's Kanagawa Prefecture. He was in his turn defeated in Koshigoe by Ashikaga Takauji, who had come in force from Kyoto to help his brother.Takauji, founder of the Ashikaga shogunate which, at least nominally, ruled Japan during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, at first established his residence at the same site in Kamakura where Yoritomo's \u014ckura Bakufu had been (see above), but in 1336 he left Kamakura in charge of his son Yoshiakira and went west in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada. The Ashikaga then decided to permanently stay in Kyoto, making Kamakura instead the capital of the Kamakura-fu (\u938c\u5009\u5e9c) (or Kant\u014d-fu (\u95a2\u6771\u5e9c)), a region including the provinces of Sagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa, Shim\u014dsa, Hitachi, Kozuke, Shimotsuke, Kai, and Izu, to which were later added Mutsu and Dewa, making it the equivalent to today's Kanto, plus the Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures.\n\nKamakura's ruler was called Kant\u014d kub\u014d, a title equivalent to sh\u014dgun assumed by Ashikaga Takauji's son Motouji after his nomination to Kant\u014d kanrei, or deputy sh\u014dgun, in 1349. Motouji transferred his original title to the Uesugi family, which had previously held the hereditary title of shitsuji (\u57f7\u4e8b), and would thereafter provide the Kant\u014d kanrei. Motouji had been sent by his father because this last understood the importance of controlling the Kant\u014d region and wanted to have an Ashikaga in power there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness, so the sh\u014dgun's idea never really worked and actually backfired. The kant\u014d kub\u014d era is essentially a struggle for the shogunate between the Kamakura and the Kyoto branches of the Ashikaga clan, because both believed they had a valid claim to power. In the end, Kamakura had to be retaken by force in 1454. The five kub\u014d recorded by history, all of Motouji's bloodline, were in order Motouji himself, Ujimitsu, Mitsukane, Mochiuji and Shigeuji. The last kub\u014d had to escape to Koga, in today's Ibaraki prefecture, and he and his descendants thereafter became known as the Koga kub\u014d. According to the Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book published in 1685, more than two centuries later the spot where the kub\u014d's mansion had been was still left empty by local peasants in the hope he may one day return.\nA long period of chaos and war followed the departure of the last Kant\u014d kub\u014d (the Sengoku period). Kamakura was heavily damaged in 1454 and almost completely burned during the Siege of Kamakura (1526). Many of its citizens moved to Odawara when it came to prominence as the home town of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan. The final blow to the city was the decision taken in 1603 by the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns to move the capital to nearby Edo, the place now called Tokyo. The city never recovered and gradually returned to be the small fishing village it had been before Yoritomo's arrival. Edmond Papinot's Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan, published in 1910 during the late Meiji period, describes it as follows:\n\nKamakura. A small town (7250 inh.) in Sagami which for several centuries was the second capital of Japan. ... At present there remain of the splendor of the past only the famous Daibutsu and the Tsurugaoka Hachiman temple.\n\n\n=== Meiji period and the 20th century ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kamakura's great cultural assets, its beach, and the mystique that surrounded its name made it as popular as it is now, and for essentially the same reasons. The destruction of its heritage nonetheless didn't stop: during the anti-Buddhist violence of 1868 (haibutsu kishaku) that followed the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (shinbutsu bunri) many of the city temples were damaged. In other cases, because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, shrines or temples had to give away some of their treasures, thus damaging their cultural heritage and decreasing the value of their properties. Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's giant Ni\u014d (\u4ec1\u738b) (the two wooden warden gods usually found at the sides of a Buddhist temple's entrance), for example, being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were brought to Jufuku-ji, where they still are.The shrine also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its tah\u014dt\u014d tower, its mid\u014d (\u5fa1\u5802), and its shichid\u014d garan.\n Some Buddhist temples were simply closed, like Zenk\u014d-ji, to which the now-independent Meigetsu-in used to belong.In 1890, the railroad, which until then had arrived just to Ofuna, reached Kamakura bringing in tourists and new residents, and with them a new prosperity. Part of the ancient Dankazura (see above) was removed to let the railway system's new Yokosuka Line pass.\nThe damage caused by time, centuries of neglect, politics, and modernization was further compounded by nature in 1923. The epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake that year was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay, a short distance from Kamakura. Tremors devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, causing widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. It was reported that the sea receded at an unprecedented velocity, and then waves rushed back towards the shore in a great wall of water over seven meters high, drowning some and crushing others beneath an avalanche of waterborne debris. The total death toll from earthquake, tsunami, and fire exceeded 2,000 victims. Large sections of the shore simply slid into the sea; and the beach area near Kamakura was raised up about six-feet; or in other words, where there had only been a narrow strip of sand along the sea, a wide expanse of sand was fully exposed above the waterline.Many temples founded centuries ago have required restoration, and it is for this reason that Kamakura has just one National Treasure in the building category (the Shariden at Engaku-ji). Much of Kamakura's heritage was for various reasons over the centuries first lost and later rebuilt.\n\n\n== Nichiren in Kamakura ==\n\nKamakura is known among Buddhists for having been the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism during the 13th century. Founder Nichiren wasn't a native; he was born in Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture. But it was only natural for a preacher to come here because the city was the political centre of the country at the time. Nichiren settled down in a straw hut in the Matsubagayatsu (literally \"pine needle valley\") district, where three temples (Ankokuron-ji, My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji, and Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honour of being the true heir of the master. During his turbulent life Nichiren came and went, but Kamakura always remained at the heart of his religious activities. It's here that, when he was about to be executed by the H\u014dj\u014d Regent for being a troublemaker, he was allegedly saved by a miracle; it's in Kamakura that he wrote his famous Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron (\u7acb\u6b63\u5b89\u56fd\u8ad6), or \"Treatise on Peace and Righteousness\"; it's here that legend says he was rescued and fed by monkeys and it's here that he preached.Some Kamakura locations important to Nichiren Buddhism are:\n\nThe three temples in MatsubagayatsuAnkokuron-ji claims to have on its grounds the cave where the master, with the help of a white monkey, hid from his persecutors. (However Hossh\u014d-ji in Zushi's Hisagi district makes the same claim, and with a better historical basis.) Within Ankokuron-ji lie also the spot where Nichiren used to meditate while admiring Mount Fuji, the place where his disciple Nichiro was cremated, and the cave where he is supposed to have written his Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron.Nearby My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji (also called \"Koke-dera\" or \"Temple of Moss\"), a much smaller temple, was erected in an area where Nichiren had his home for 19 years. The third Nichiren temple in Nagoe, Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji, also claims to lie on the very spot where it all started.\n\nThe Nichiren Tsujisepp\u014d Ato (\u65e5\u84ee\u8056\u4eba\u8fbb\u8aac\u6cd5\u8de1) on Komachi \u014cji in the Komachi district contains the very stone from which he used to harangue the crowds, claiming that the various calamities that were afflicting the city at the moment were due to the moral failings of its citizens.\nThe former execution ground at Katase's Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji where Nichiren was about to be beheaded (an event known to Nichiren's followers as the Tatsunokuchi Persecution (\u9f8d\u30ce\u53e3\u6cd5\u96e3)), and where he was miraculously saved when thunder struck the executioner. Nichiren had been condemned to death for having written the Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron. Every year, on September 12, Nichiren devotees gather to celebrate the anniversary of the miracle.\nThe Kesagake no Matsu (\u8888\u88df\u639b\u3051\u306e\u677e), the pine tree on the roads between Harisuribashi and Inamuragasaki from which Nichiren hanged his kesa (a Buddhist stole) while on his way to Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji. The original pine tree however died long ago and, after having been replaced many times, now no longer exists.\n\n\n== Notable locations ==\n\nKamakura has many historically significant Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, some of them, like Sugimoto-dera, over 1,200 years old. K\u014dtoku-in, with its monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amida Buddha, is the most famous. A 15th-century tsunami destroyed the temple that once housed the Great Buddha, but the statue survived and has remained outdoors ever since. This iconic Daibutsu is arguably amongst the few images which have come to represent Japan in the world's collective imagination. Kamakura also hosts the so-called Five Great Zen Temples (the Kamakura Gozan).\nThe architectural heritage of Kamakura is almost unmatched, and the city has proposed some of its historic sites for inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list. Although much of the city was devastated in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923, damaged temples and shrines, founded centuries ago, have since been carefully restored.\nSome of Kamakura's highlights are:\n\nThe Asaina Pass and its Kumano Jinja\nAnkokuron-ji\nAn'y\u014d-in\nCh\u014dju-ji, one of Ashikaga Takauji's two \"bodaiji\" (funeral temples)\nEngaku-ji, ranked Number Two among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nHatakeyama Shigeyasu's grave\nH\u014dkai-ji, dedicated to the memory of the H\u014dj\u014d clan\nJ\u014dchi-ji, ranked Number Four among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nJ\u014dmy\u014d-ji temple, ranked Number Five among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nJufuku-ji, ranked Number Three among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nHase-dera\nKamakura-g\u016b in Nikaid\u014d, built on the spot where Prince Morinaga, son of Emperor Go-Daigo, was imprisoned and then beheaded by Ashikaga Tadayoshi in 1335.\nKamakura Museum of National Treasures\nKanagawa Prefectural Ofuna Botanical Garden\nKench\u014d-ji, ranked Number One among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples and, together with Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, the pride of the city\nK\u014dmy\u014d-ji\nK\u014dtoku-in and its Great Buddha\nThe Kamakura Museum of Literature, the former villa of Marquises Maeda\nMeigetsu-in\nMoto Hachiman\nMy\u014dhon-ji\n\u014cfuna Kannon\nTatsunokuchi, where Mongol emissaries were beheaded and buried.\nKatase's Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji\nSasuke Inari Shrine Sasuke Inari Shrine and Hidden Village\nSugimoto-dera\nThe Shakad\u014d Pass (see description below)\nT\u014dkei-ji, famous in the past as a refuge for battered women\nTomb of Minamoto no Yoritomo\nTsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, symbol of the city\nWakamiya \u014cji Avenue with its three torii and cherry trees\nYuigahama, a popular beach\nTamanawa Castle, Castle ruins of Later H\u014dj\u014d clan\nZeniarai Benzaiten Shrine, where visitors go to wash their coins\nZuisen-ji, funeral temple of the Ashikaga kub\u014d, rulers in Kamakura during the early Muromachi period\n\n\n== Festivals and other events ==\n\nKamakura has many festivals (matsuri (\u796d\u308a)) and other events in each of the seasons, usually based on its rich historical heritage. They are often sponsored by private businesses and, unlike those in Kyoto, they are relatively small-scale events attended mostly by locals and a few tourists. January in particular has many because it's the first month of the year, so authorities, fishermen, businesses and artisans organize events to pray for their own health and safety, and for a good and prosperous working year. Kamakura's numerous temples and shrines, first among them city symbols Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and Kench\u014d-ji, organize many events too, bringing the total to over a hundred.\n\n\n=== January ===\n4th \u2013 Ch\u014dna-hajimeshiki (\u624b\u65a7\u521d\u5f0f) at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b: This event marks the beginning of the working year for local construction workers who, for the ceremony, use traditional working tools. The festival also commemorates Minamoto no Yoritomo, who ordered the reconstruction of the main building of the shrine after it was destroyed by fire in 1191. The ceremony takes place at 1:00 pm at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b.\n\n\n=== February ===\nDay before the first day of spring (usually Feb. 3) \u2013  Setsubun Matsuri (\u7bc0\u5206\u796d) at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, Kench\u014d-ji, Hase-dera, Kamakura-g\u016b, etc. : Celebration of the end of winter. Beans are scattered in the air to ensure good luck.\n\n\n=== April ===\n2nd to 3rd Sunday: Kamakura Matsuri at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and other locations: A whole week of events that celebrate the city and its history.\n\n\n=== May ===\n5th \u2013  Kusajishi (\u8349\u9e7f) at the Kamakura Shrine: Archers in samurai gear shoot arrows at a straw deer while reciting old poems.\n\n\n=== August ===\n10th (or following Monday if it falls on a Saturday)- A full hour of fireworks on the beach in Yuigahama.\n\n\n=== September ===\n14th, 15th and 16th \u2013  Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b Reitaisai (\u9db4\u5ca1\u516b\u5e61\u5bae\u4f8b\u5927\u796d): Famous festival with many attractions, the most famous of which is the Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac), or Japanese horseback archery, which takes place on the 16th.\n\n\n== Shakad\u014d Pass ==\n\nBesides the Seven Entrances there is another great pass in the city, the huge Shakad\u014d Pass (\u91c8\u8fe6\u5802\u5207\u901a), which connects Shakad\u014dgayatsu to the \u014cmachi and Nagoe (formerly called Nagoshi) districts.\nAccording to the plaque near the pass itself, the name derives from the fact that third Shikken H\u014dj\u014d Yasutoki built here a Shakad\u014d (a Buddhist temple devoted to Shakyamuni) dedicated to his father Yoshitoki's memory. The original location of the temple is unclear, but it was closed some time in the middle Muromachi period. The Shaka Nyorai statue that is supposed to have been its main object of cult has been declared an Important Cultural Property and is conserved at Daien-ji in Meguro, Tokyo.Although important, the pass was not considered one of the Entrances because it connected two areas both fully within Kamakura. Its date of creation is unclear, as it's not explicitly mentioned in any historical record, and it could be therefore recent. It seems very likely however that a pass which connected the Kanazawa Road to the Nagoe area called Inukakezaka (\u72ac\u61f8\u5742) and mentioned in the Genpei J\u014dsuiki (\u6e90\u5e73\u76db\u54c0\u8a18) in relation to an 1180 war in Kotsubo between the Miura clan and the Hatakeyama clan is indeed the Shakad\u014d Pass. In any case, the presence of two yagura tombs (see the following section) within it means that it can be dated to at least the Kamakura period. It was then an important way of transit, but it was also much narrower than today and harder to pass.Inside the pass, there are two small yagura tombs containing some gorint\u014d. On the Shakad\u014dgayatsu side of the pass, just before the first houses a small street on the left takes to a large group of yagura called Shakad\u014dgayatsu Yagura-gun. There rest the bones of some of the hundreds of H\u014dj\u014d family members who committed suicide at T\u014dsh\u014d-ji after the fall of Kamakura in 1333.The pass appears many times in some recent Japanese films like \"The Blue Light\", Tada, Kimi o Aishiteru, and \"Peeping Tom\" (\u771f\u6728\u6817\u30ce\u7a74, Makiguri no ana). The pass is presently closed to all traffic because of the danger posed by falling rocks.\nOn April 28, 2010, a day of heavy rain, a large section of rock on the Omachi side of the Shakado Pass gave way, making the road temporarily impassable for pedestrians.\n\n\n== Yagura tombs ==\n\nAn important and characteristic feature of Kamakura is a type of grave called yagura (\u3084\u3050\u3089). Yagura are caves dug on the side of hills during the Middle Ages to serve as tombs for high-ranking personalities and priests. Two famous examples are H\u014dj\u014d Masako's and Minamoto no Sanetomo's cenotaphs in Jufuku-ji's cemetery, about 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) from Kamakura Station.\nUsually present in the cemetery of most Buddhist temples in the town, they are extremely numerous also in the hills surrounding it, and estimates of their number always put them in the thousands. Yagura can be found either isolated or in groups of even 180 graves, as in the Hyakuhachi Yagura (\u767e\u516b\u3084\u3050\u3089). Many are now abandoned and in a bad state of preservation.The reason why they were dug is not known, but it is thought likely that the tradition started because of the lack of flat land within the narrow limits of Kamakura's territory. Started during the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), the tradition seems to have declined during the following Muromachi period, when storehouses and cemeteries came to be preferred.\nTrue yagura can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and even in distant Awa Province (Chiba).Tombs in caves can also be found in the T\u014dhoku region, near Hiroshima and Kyoto, and in Ishikawa Prefecture, however they are not called yagura and their relationship with those in Kanagawa Prefecture is unknown.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJR East's Yokosuka Line has three stations within the city. \u014cfuna Station is the northernmost. Next is Kita-Kamakura Station. In the center of the city is Kamakura Station, the central railway station in the city.\nKamakura Station is the terminal for the Enoshima Electric Railway. This railway runs westward to Fujisawa, and part of its route runs parallel to the seashore. After leaving Kamakura Station, trains make eight more station stops in the city. One of them is Hase Station, closest to Hase-dera and K\u014dtoku-in.  The next station on the line is Gokurakuji Station, one of the settings for the 2014 film Our Little Sister.\n\n\n=== Highway ===\nNational Route 134\n\n\n== Education ==\nKamakura has many educational facilities. The city operates sixteen public elementary schools and nine middle schools. The national government has one elementary and one middle school, and there are two private elementary and six private middle schools. At the next level are four prefectural and six private high schools. Also in Kamakura is a prefectural special school.\nKamakura Women's University is the city's sole university.\n\n\n== Government and administration ==\nKamakura has a mayor and a city council, all publicly elected. The mayor is Takashi Matsuo (Politician). The City Council consists of 28 members.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nKamakura has six sister cities. Three are in Japan and three are overseas:\nNice, France (1966)\nUeda, Nagano, Japan (1979)\nHagi, Yamaguchi, Japan (1979)\nAshikaga, Tochigi, Japan (1982)\nDunhuang, China (1998)\nNashville, Tennessee, USA (2014)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHall, John Whitney, Peter Duus (1990).

        "wiki": "Japan (Japanese: \u65e5\u672c, Nippon [\u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274] (listen) or Nihon [\u0272iho\ua71c\u0274] (listen)) is an island country of East Asia in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It borders the Sea of Japan to the west and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Japan is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and comprises an archipelago of 6,852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); its five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city; other major cities include Osaka and Nagoya.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 126.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is administratively divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally divided into eight regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nThe islands of Japan were inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period, though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d. Starting in the 12th century, however, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh\u014dgun), feudal lords (daimy\u014d), and a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted a foreign policy of isolation. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, leading to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji era, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-style constitution and pursued industrialization and modernization. Japan invaded China in 1937; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under an Allied occupation, during which it adopted a post-war constitution. It has since maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an elected legislature known as the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the G7. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains a modern military ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful. Following World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant economic growth ever since the Lost Decade, the country's economy is still the third-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. Japan is a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries and has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan also has the world's second-highest life expectancy, though it is currently experiencing a decline in population. Japan has one of the richest cultures in the world, and is renowned for its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, including its prominent animation and video game industries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji \u65e5\u672c and pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (\u502d) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.  Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored today for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", in reference to Japan's relatively eastern location. It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".The name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric to classical history ===\n\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J\u014dmon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh\u014dtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).The far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince \u014cama and his nephew Prince \u014ctomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih\u014d Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsury\u014d state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.The Nara period (710\u2013784) marked an emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.\n\n\n=== Feudal era ===\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the sh\u014dguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). However, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy\u014ds) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy\u014ds; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh\u014dgun by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy\u014ds, and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the sh\u014dgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935.The early 20th century saw a period of Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of Radical Nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, beginning World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. Throughout areas colonized by Japan, many abuses were committed against locals, notably those who were forced to become comfort women. The war cost Japan its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives, and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\". In the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became the new emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJapan comprises 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) northeast\u2013southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China and Philippine Seas. The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi). Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km (18,486 mi)). Because of its many far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries. Approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index. Japan has 108 active volcanoes, which are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. Japan was originally attached to the Eurasian continent; the subducting plates opened the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.  During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter. In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round. The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp\u014d Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 \u00b0C (41.2 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 \u00b0C (77.4 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 \u00b0C (106.0 \u00b0F), was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According to the Environment Ministry heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused several problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 37 Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.As of 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Prior to this incident, Japan's emissions had been on the decline, largely because their nuclear power plants created no emissions. Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation  to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. The official goals of the Japanese government are to reduce emissions in 2030 by 26% comparing to 2013 levels and 80% in 2050. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. He is defined in the Constitution as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people\". Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, 2019.\n\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet is currently dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955. The prime minister is the head of government and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. As the head of the Cabinet, the prime minister has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State. Following the LDP victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz\u014d Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the prime minister.Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature, and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 22 years. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan partially for that purpose.Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia: Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G20 Summit to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region.Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nJapan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.\nThe military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The Maritime Self-Defense Force is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. The Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.\n\n\n=== Domestic law enforcement ===\n\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency and supervised by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.Additionally, there is the Japan Coast Guard which guards territorial waters. The coast guard patrols the sea surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2017, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.As of 2017, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around three percent. Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2013. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.Japan's exports amounted to US$5,430 per capita in 2017. As of 2017, Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.4 percent), China (19 percent), South Korea (7.6 percent), Hong Kong (5.1 percent) and Thailand (4.2 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2017 were China (24.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), Australia (5.8 percent), South Korea (4.2 percent), and Saudi Arabia (4.1 percent). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country.Japan ranks 34th of 190 countries in the 2018 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like \"The Toyota Way\", and shareholder activism is rare. Japan also has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world.Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016.\n\n\n=== Agriculture and fishery ===\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometers (14,000,000 acres) cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan ranked seventh and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. Some major Japanese industrial companies include Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel. The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world.Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.  Despite facing competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong through an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.\n\n\n=== Services and tourism ===\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, \u00c6ON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines listed as some of the largest in the world. Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The six major keiretsus are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015 and increased by 21.8% to attract 24.03 million international tourists in 2016. In 2008, the Japanese government set up Japan Tourism Agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020. In 2016, having met the 20 million target, the government revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030. For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015. Japan is one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis, and it was by far the least visited country in the G7 until 2014.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, which relative to gross domestic product is the third highest budget in the world. The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine and three Fields medalists.Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% of the world's industrial robots as of 2013. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 per 10,000 employees.The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. Japan became a major exporter of video games during the golden age of arcade video games, an era that began with the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and ended around the mid-1980s. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s, and Japan dominated the industry until Microsoft's Xbox consoles began challenging Sony and Nintendo in the 2000s. As of 2009, $6 billion of Japan's $20 billion gaming market is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Japan is now the world's largest market for mobile games; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nJapan's road spending has been extensive. Its 1.2 million kilometers (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation. As of 2012, Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometers (755,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometers (635,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometers (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometers (5,000 miles) of national expressways. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (Hokkaido has a separate network). Cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality. A new Maglev line called the Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen is being constructed between Tokyo and Nagoya. It is due to be completed in 2027.There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport. Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nAs of 2017, 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nThe government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities. Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million, of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019). Honsh\u016b is the world's second most populous island and has 80% of Japan's population. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).Japanese society is linguistically, ethnically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.1% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers. The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent, and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan. In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians, the largest community of Westerners.Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010\u20132015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050. On September 15, 2018, for the first time, one in five Japanese residents was aged 70 or older. 26.18 million people are 70 or older and accounted for 20.7 percent of the population. Elderly women crossed the 20 million line at 20.12 million, substantially outnumbering the nation's 15.45 million elderly men. The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050.Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new naturalized citizens per year. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nJapan has full religious freedom based on its constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d). However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual, despite participating in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition. As a result, religious statistics are often under-reported in Japan. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians, most of them living in the western part of the country.  As of 2007, there were 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.Islam in Japan is estimated to constitute about 80\u201390% of foreign-born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Many of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith; since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nMore than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery after World War II when the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the standard school system. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 4.1 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 5.0 percent. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth.  In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent. In addition, 60.4 percent Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Japan has a high suicide rate; suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30. Another significant public health issue is smoking. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.\n\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n\nJapanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz\u014d Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.During the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were the first \"modern\" novelists of Japan, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors \u2013 Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers. Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar\u014d Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan.The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku. Noh and ky\u014dgen theater traditions are among the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.\n\n\n=== Customs and holidays ===\n\nIshin-denshin (\u4ee5\u5fc3\u4f1d\u5fc3) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. Isagiyosa (\u6f54\u3055) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world. Hansei (\u53cd\u7701) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (\u8a00\u970a) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names. There are many annual festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese matsuri (\u796d). There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H\u014dritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nJapanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staple of Japanese cuisine, typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Dishes inspired by foreign food\u2014in particular Chinese food\u2014like ramen and gy\u014dza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nTelevision and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. Over the 1990s, television surpassed newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium. There are six nationwide television networks: NHK (public broadcasting), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi (EX) and TV Tokyo Network (TXN). Television networks were mostly established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television shows. According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.Japanese readers have a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers, with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspapers are the Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in 1999, 85.4 percent of men and 75 percent of women read a newspaper every day.Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; movies have been produced in Japan since 1897. Ishir\u014d Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times, more than any other Asian country. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced. Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.Japan has significant involvement in motorsport. Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan also have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series. The country also hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix, Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka 10 Hours, 6 Hours of Fuji, FIA WTCC Race of Japan and the Indy Japan 300.\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. Further, the country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record six times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan also hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Japan-related articles\nOutline of Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Government\n\nJapanGov \u2013 The Government of Japan (in English)\nPrime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet Official website (in English)\nThe Imperial Household Agency, official site of the Imperial House of Japan\nNational Diet Library General information\n\nJapan from UCB Libraries GovPubs\nJapan Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica entry\nJapan profile from BBC News\nJapan from the OECD\n Geographic data related to Japan at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Japanese Americans (Japanese: \u65e5\u7cfb\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba, Hepburn: Nikkei Amerikajin) are Americans who are fully or partially of Japanese descent, especially those who identify with that ancestry and its cultural characteristics. Japanese Americans were among the three largest Asian American ethnic communities during the 20th century; but, according to the 2000 census, they have declined in number to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 773,000, including those of partial ancestry. According to the 2010 census, the largest Japanese American communities were found in California with 272,528, Hawaii with 185,502, New York with 37,780, Washington with 35,008, Illinois with 17,542, and Ohio with 16,995. Southern California has the largest Japanese American population in North America and the city of Gardena holds the densest Japanese American population in the 48 contiguous states.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\nPeople from Japan began migrating to the US in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the Meiji Restoration in 1868. These early Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka and most of them settled in either Hawaii or along the West Coast. The Japanese population in the United States grew from 148 in 1880 (mostly students) to 2,039 in 1890 and 24,326 by 1900.In 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement between the governments of Japan and the United States ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US. Prior to the Gentlemen's Agreement, about seven out of eight ethnic Japanese in the continental United States were men.  By 1924, the ratio had changed to approximately four women to every six men. Japanese immigration to the U.S. effectively ended when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 which banned all but a token few Japanese people. The earlier Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized United States citizenship to free white persons, which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws.  Due to these restrictions, Japanese immigration to the United States between 1931-1950 only totaled 3,503 which is strikingly low compared to the totals of 46,250 people in 1951\u20131960, 39,988 in 1961-70, 49,775 in 1971-80, 47,085 in 1981-90, and 67,942 in 1991-2000.Because no new immigrants from Japan were permitted after 1924, almost all pre-World War II Japanese Americans born after this time were born in the United States. This generation, the Nisei, became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the Sansei. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries.\nIn recent years, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the US from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration.\n\n\n=== Internment and redress ===\n\nDuring World War II, an estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals or citizens residing on the West Coast of the United States were forcibly interned in ten different camps across the Western United States. The internment was based on the race or ancestry, rather than the activities of the interned. Families, including children, were interned together.\nFour decades later, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 officially acknowledged the \"fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights\" of the internment. Many Japanese-Americans consider the term internment camp a euphemism and prefer to refer to the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans as imprisonment in concentration camps. Webster's New World Fourth College Edition defines a concentration camp: \"A prison camp in which political dissidents, members of minority ethnic groups, etc. are confined.\"\n\n\n== Cultural profile ==\n\n\n=== Generations ===\nThe nomenclature for each of their generations who are citizens or long-term residents of countries other than Japan, used by Japanese Americans and other nationals of Japanese descent are explained here; they are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (sei \u4e16). The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like Issei, Nisei, and Sansei, which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called Yonsei (\u56db\u4e16), and the fifth is called Gosei (\u4e94\u4e16). The term Nikkei (\u65e5\u7cfb) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.\n\nThe kanreki (\u9084\u66a6), a pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of Japanese American Nisei. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this traditional Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nIssei and many nisei speak Japanese in addition to English as a second language. In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese characters are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many nisei and sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nJapanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education. Math and reading scores on the SAT and ACT may often exceed the national averages. Japanese Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide Advanced Placement testing each year.A large majority of Japanese Americans obtain post-secondary degrees. Japanese Americans often face the \"model minority\" stereotype that they are dominant in math- and science-related fields in colleges and universities across the United States. In reality, however, there is an equal distribution of Japanese Americans between the arts and humanities and the sciences. Although their numbers have declined slightly in recent years, Japanese Americans are still a prominent presence in Ivy League schools, the top University of California campuses including UC Berkeley and UCLA, and other elite universities. The 2000 census reported that 40.8% of Japanese Americans held a college degree.\n\n\n==== Schools for Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals ====\n\nA Japanese school opened in Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for temporary settlers in North America followed. In the years prior to World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might go through the same discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.There are primary school-junior high school Japanese international schools within the United States. Some are classified as nihonjin gakk\u014d or Japanese international schools operated by Japanese associations, and some are classified as Shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu (\u79c1\u7acb\u5728\u5916\u6559\u80b2\u65bd\u8a2d) or overseas branches of Japanese private schools. They are: Seigakuin Atlanta International School, Chicago Futabakai Japanese School, Japanese School of Guam, Nishiyamato Academy of California near Los Angeles, Japanese School of New Jersey, and New York Japanese School. A boarding senior high school, Keio Academy of New York, is near New York City. It is a Shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu.There are also supplementary Japanese educational institutions (hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d) that hold Japanese classes on weekends. They are located in several US cities. The supplementary schools target Japanese nationals and second-generation Japanese Americans living in the United States. There are also Japanese heritage schools for third generation and beyond Japanese Americans. Rachel Endo of Hamline University, the author of \"Realities, Rewards, and Risks of Heritage-Language Education: Perspectives from Japanese Immigrant Parents in a Midwestern Community,\" wrote that the heritage schools \"generally emphasize learning about Japanese American historical experiences and Japanese culture in more loosely defined terms\".Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School (shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu) and International Bilingual School (unapproved by the Japanese Ministry of Education or MEXT) were full-time Japanese schools that were formerly in existence.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nJapanese Americans practice a wide range of religions, including Mahayana Buddhism (J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b, J\u014ddo-sh\u016b, Nichiren, Shingon, and Zen forms being most prominent) their majority faith, Shinto, and Christianity. In many ways, due to the longstanding nature of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japanese society, many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with Japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms.\n\nA large number of the Japanese American community continue to practice Buddhism in some form, and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around Buddhist institutions. For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual Obon Festival, which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as Southern California and Hawaii. A reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans.\nMany Japanese Americans also practice Christianity. Among mainline denominations the Presbyterians have long been active. The First Japanese Presbyterian Church of San Francisco opened in 1885. Los Angeles Holiness Church was founded by six Japanese men and women in 1921. There is also the Japanese Evangelical Missionary Society (JEMS) formed in the 1950s. It operates Asian American Christian Fellowships (AACF) programs on university campuses, especially in California. The Japanese language ministries are fondly known as \"Nichigo\" in Japanese American Christian communities. The newest trend includes Asian American members who do not have a Japanese heritage.\n\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nAn important annual festival for Japanese Americans is the Obon Festival, which happens in July or August of each year. Across the country, Japanese Americans gather on fair grounds, churches and large civic parking lots and commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food. Carnival booths are usually set up so Japanese American children have the opportunity to play together.\nJapanese American celebrations tend to be more sectarian in nature and focus on the community-sharing aspects.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nJapanese Americans have shown strong support for candidates in both political parties. Shortly prior to the 2004 US presidential election, Japanese Americans narrowly favored Democrat John Kerry by a 42% to 38% margin over Republican George W. Bush. In the 2008 US presidential election, the National Asian American Survey found that Japanese American favored Democrat Barack Obama by a 62% to 16% margin over Republican John McCain, while 22% were still undecided.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe distribution of the Y-chromosome among Japanese males is a lot different from the males of neighboring countries, such as in Taiwanese males. The Y chromosome is directly correlated to Asian populations, especially in Japanese Americans. The chromosome addition of Y Alu polymorphic element is only displayed in Japanese American men. People of Japanese descent show the highest frequency of the haplogroup O3a5. Haplogroups are groups of genetic populations that share a common ancestor, paternally or maternally. The frequency of this haplogroup is about 5% higher than its frequency in other Asian groups such as Koreans, Manchus, and other Northeast Asians. The Japanese DNA sequence consists of 24.2% Korean, 16.1% Okinawa, 4.8% Uniquely Japanese, 25.8% Chinese, 8.1% Ainu, and 21% Unidentified. The Ainu people were the key to the Japanese genetic origins because researchers found an exact DNA match with the Ainu and the J\u014dmon Japanese to conclude the Ainu rooted all the way back to the J\u014dmon. From mainland Japanese people, the MtDNA haplogroup frequencies are most occurring in the D4 haplogroup, with about 33%, with the second largest frequency in the B4 haplogroup, containing about 9%, and the third largest frequency in the M7a haplogroup, occurring at about 8%. The rest of the other haplogroup frequencies are much smaller than D4, with frequencies ranging from about 3-5%, consisting of mostly N9a, M8, and M9 haplogroups. Between the different Japanese populations, the Yayoi population has the highest haplogroup frequencies of the D4 haplogroup. The J\u014dmon Japanese group has the highest frequency of the N9b haplogroup. In modern Japanese Americans, the highest haplogroup frequency is in the D4 haplogroup, the same as the Yayoi Japanese population. In Okinawa Japanese populations, the highest frequency of haplogroups is the D haplogroup, with the M7a haplogroup frequency directly behind. Of the Ainu Japanese population, the highest haplogroup frequency occurs in the Y haplogroup, followed closely by an even distribution of frequency in the D, M7a, and G haplogroups. Lastly, for mainland Japanese populations, the D haplogroup presents the highest frequency. In Japanese Americans, the biggest components are Chinese, Korean, and Okinawan. People of Japanese descent show two pre-Yayoi ancestral Y chromosome lineages descended from Paleolithic people who had been isolated on the mainland of Japan. Studies of the mitochondrial component of Japanese American genes of haplogroup M12 shows a direct correlation of Japanese haplotypes with Tibetans. Other haplotypes that early descents of Japanese people were thought to be carried into include C-M8, which is another Y-chromosome haplotype. Also going back to the J\u014dmon, that gene is displayed in high frequencies in people of Japanese descent. The estimated percentage of this type of gene in Japanese Americans is about 34.7%. The highest frequencies occur in Okinawans and Hokkaidos. Overall, the genetic makeup of Japanese Americans show very mixed origins of genes, all due to the result of migrations of the Japanese ancestors in the past.\n\n\n=== Risk for inherited diseases ===\nStudies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to Japanese Americans, specifically in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer's disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based on a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60 mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding \"bad genes\" denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.\n\n\n== Japanese Americans by state ==\n\n\n=== California ===\n\nIn the early 1900s, Japanese Americans established fishing communities on Terminal Island and in San Diego. By 1923, there were two thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of Los Angeles Harbor. By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen. Still, areas like San Francisco's Japantown managed to thrive.\nDue to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, historically Japanese areas fell into disrepair or became adopted by other minority groups (in the case of Black and Latino populations in Little Tokyo). Boats owned by Japanese Americans were confiscated by the U.S. Navy. One of the vessels owned by a Japanese American, the Alert, built in 1930, became YP-264 in December 1941, and was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2014. When Japanese Americans returned from internment, many settled in neighborhoods where they set up their own community centers in order to feel accepted. Today, many have been renamed cultural centers and focus on the sharing of Japanese culture with local community members, especially in the sponsorship of Obon festivals.The city of Torrance in Greater Los Angeles has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies. Because of the abundance of Japanese restaurants and other cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A. Weekly wrote that Torrance was \"essentially Japan's 48th prefecture\".\n\n\n=== Connecticut ===\nThe Japanese School of New York is located in Greenwich, Connecticut in Greater New York City; it had formerly been located in New York City.\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nThe Seigakuin Atlanta International School is located in Peachtree Corners in Greater Atlanta.\n\n\n=== Hawaii ===\n\n\n=== Illinois ===\nAs of 2011 there is a Japanese community in Arlington Heights, near Chicago. Jay Shimotake, the president of the Mid America Japanese Club, an organization located in Arlington Heights, said \"Arlington Heights is a very convenient location, and Japanese people in the business environment know it's a nice location surrounding O'Hare airport.\" The Chicago Futabakai Japanese School is located in Arlington Heights.

        "wiki": "Japanese gardens (\u65e5\u672c\u5ead\u5712, nihon teien) are traditional gardens whose designs are accompanied by Japanese aesthetics and philosophical ideas, avoid artificial ornamentation, and highlight the natural landscape. Plants and worn, aged materials are generally used by Japanese garden designers to suggest an ancient and faraway natural landscape, and to express the fragility of existence as well as time's unstoppable advance.Ancient Japanese art inspired past garden designers. By the Edo period, the Japanese garden had its own distinct appearance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe idea of these unique gardens began during the Asuka period. Japanese merchants witnessed the gardens that were being built in China and brought many of the Chinese gardening techniques and styles back to Japan. Today, the tradition of Japanese garden art is still popular around the world, with many eastern and western practitioners expressing themselves through the medium.\n\nJapanese gardens first appeared on the island of Honshu, the large central island of Japan. Their aesthetic was influenced by the distinct characteristics of the Honshu landscape: rugged volcanic peaks, narrow valleys, mountain streams with waterfalls and cascades, lakes, and beaches of small stones. They were also influenced by the rich variety of flowers and different species of trees, particularly evergreen trees, on the islands, and by the four distinct seasons in Japan, including hot, wet summers and snowy winters.Japanese gardens have their roots in the Japanese religion of Shinto, with its story of the creation of eight perfect islands, and of the shinchi, the lakes of the gods. Prehistoric Shinto shrines to the kami, the gods and spirits, are found on beaches and in forests all over the island. Prehistoric shrines often took the form of unusual rocks or trees marked with cords of rice fiber (shimenawa) and surrounded with white stones or pebbles, a symbol of purity. The white gravel courtyard became a distinctive feature of Shinto shrines, Imperial Palaces, Buddhist temples, and Zen gardens.Japanese gardens were also strongly influenced by the Chinese philosophy of Daoism and Amida Buddhism, imported from China in or around 552. Daoist legends spoke of five mountainous islands inhabited by the Eight Immortals, who lived in perfect harmony with nature. Each Immortal flew from his mountain home on the back of a crane. The islands themselves were located on the back of an enormous sea turtle. In Japan, the five islands of the Chinese legend became one island, called Horai-zen, or Mount Horai. Replicas of this legendary mountain, the symbol of a perfect world, are a common feature of Japanese gardens, as are rocks representing turtles and cranes.\n\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nThe earliest recorded Japanese gardens were the pleasure gardens of the Japanese Emperors and nobles. They are mentioned in several brief passages of the Nihon Shoki, the first chronicle of Japanese history, published in 720. In the spring of the year 74, the chronicle recorded: \"The Emperor Keik\u014d put a few carp into a pond, and rejoiced to see them morning and evening\". The following year, \"The Emperor launched a double-hulled boat in the pond of Ijishi at Ihare, and went aboard with his imperial concubine, and they feasted sumptuously together\". And in 486, \"The Emperor Kenz\u014d went into the garden and feasted at the edge of a winding stream\".The Chinese garden had a very strong influence on early Japanese gardens. In or around 552, Buddhism was officially installed from China, via Korea, into Japan. Between 600 and 612, the Japanese Emperor sent four legations to the Court of the Chinese Sui Dynasty. Between 630 and 838, the Japanese court sent fifteen more legations to the court of the Tang Dynasty. These legations, with more than five hundred members each, included diplomats, scholars, students, Buddhist monks, and translators. They brought back Chinese writing, art objects, and detailed descriptions of Chinese gardens.\nIn 612, the Empress Suiko had a garden built with an artificial mountain, representing Shumi-Sen, or Mount Sumeru, reputed in Hindu and Buddhist legends to be located at the centre of the world. During the reign of the same Empress, one of her ministers, Soga no Umako, had a garden built at his palace featuring a lake with several small islands, representing the islands of the Eight Immortals famous in Chinese legends and Daoist philosophy. This Palace became the property of the Japanese Emperors, was named \"The Palace of the Isles\", and was mentioned several times in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the \"Collection of Countless Leaves\", the oldest known collection of Japanese poetry.\nIt appears from the small amount of literary and archaeological evidence available that the Japanese gardens of this time were modest versions of the Imperial gardens of the Tang Dynasty, with large lakes scattered with artificial islands and artificial mountains. Pond edges were constructed with heavy rocks as embankment. While these gardens had some Buddhist and Daoist symbolism, they were meant to be pleasure gardens, and places for festivals and celebrations.\n\n\n=== Nara period (710\u2013794) ===\n\nThe Nara Period is named after its capital city Nara. The first authentically Japanese gardens were built in this city at the end of the eighth century. Shorelines and stone settings were naturalistic, different from the heavier, earlier continental mode of constructing pond edges. Two such gardens have been found at excavations, both of which were used for poetry-writing festivities. One of these gardens, the East Palace garden at Heijo Palace, Nara, has been faithfully reconstructed using the same location and even the original garden features that had been excavated.\n\n\n=== Heian period (794\u20131185) ===\nIn 794, at the beginning of the Heian Period, the Japanese court moved its capital to Heian-ky\u014d (present-day Kyoto). During this period, there were three different kinds of gardens: palace gardens and the gardens of nobles in the capital, the gardens of villas at the edge of the city, and the gardens of temples.\nThe architecture of the palaces, residences and gardens in the Heian period followed Chinese practice. Houses and gardens were aligned on a north-south axis, with the residence to the north and the ceremonial buildings and main garden to the south, there were two long wings to the south, like the arms of an armchair, with the garden between them. The gardens featured one or more lakes connected by bridges and winding streams. The south garden of the imperial residences had a specially Japanese feature: a large empty area of white sand or gravel. The Emperor was the chief priest of Japan, and the white sand represented purity, and was a place where the gods could be invited to visit. The area was used for religious ceremonies and dances for the welcoming of the gods.The layout of the garden itself was strictly determined according to the principles of traditional Chinese geomancy, or Feng Shui. The first known book on the art of the Japanese garden, the Sakuteiki (Records of Garden Keeping), written in the 11th century, said:\n\nIt is a good omen to make the stream arrive from the east, to enter the garden, pass under the house, and then leave from the southeast. In this way, the water of the blue dragon will carry away all the bad spirits from the house toward the white tiger.\nThe Imperial gardens of the Heian period were water gardens, where visitors promenaded in elegant lacquered boats, listening to music, viewing the distant mountains, singing, reading poetry, painting, and admiring the scenery of the garden. The social life in the gardens was memorably described in the classic Japanese novel The Tale of Genji, written in about 1005 by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress. The traces of one such artificial lake, Osawa no ike, near the Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto, still can be seen. It was built by the Emperor Saga, who ruled from 809 to 823, and was said to be inspired by Dongting Lake in China.A scaled-down replica of the Kyoto Imperial Palace of 794, the Heian-jing\u016b, was built in Kyoto in 1895 to celebrate the 1100th birthday of the city. The south garden is famous for its cherry blossom in spring, and for azaleas in the early summer. The west garden is known for the irises in June, and the large east garden lake recalls the leisurely boating parties of the 8th century.  Near the end of the Heian period a new garden architecture style appeared, created by the followers of Pure Land Buddhism. These were called \"Paradise Gardens\", built to represent the legendary Paradise of the West, where the Amida Buddha ruled. These were built by noblemen who wanted to assert their power and independence from the Imperial household, which was growing weaker.\n\nThe best surviving example of a Paradise Garden is By\u014dd\u014d-in in Uji, near Kyoto. It was originally the villa of Fujiwara Michinaga (966\u20131028), who married his daughters to the sons of the Emperor. After his death, his son transformed the villa into a temple, and in 1053 built the Hall of Phoenix, which still stands.\nThe Hall is built in the traditional style of a Chinese Song Dynasty temple, on an island in the lake. It houses a gilded statue of the Amit\u0101bha Buddha, looking to the west. In the lake in front of the temple is a small island of white stones, representing Mount Horai, the home of the Eight Immortals of the Daoists, connected to the temple by a bridge, which symbolized the way to paradise. It was designed for mediation and contemplation, not as a pleasure garden. It was a lesson in Daoist and Buddhist philosophy created with landscape and architecture, and a prototype for future Japanese gardens.\n\nNotable existing or recreated Heian gardens include:\n\nDaikaku-ji\nBy\u014dd\u014d-in\nKyoto Imperial Palace\nJ\u014druri-ji\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kamakura and Muromachi periods (1185\u20131573) ===\n\nThe weakness of the Emperors and the rivalry of feudal warlords resulted in two civil wars (1156 and 1159), which destroyed most of Kyoto and its gardens. The capital moved to Kamakura, and then in 1336 back to the Muromachi quarter of Kyoto. The Emperors ruled in name only; real power was held by a military governor, the sh\u014dgun. During this period, the Government reopened relations with China, which had been broken off almost three hundred years earlier. Japanese monks went again to study in China, and Chinese monks came to Japan, fleeing the Mongol invasions. The monks brought with them a new form of Buddhism, called simply Zen, or \"meditation\". The first zen garden in Japan was built by a Chinese priest in 1251 in Kamakura. Japan enjoyed a renaissance in religion, in the arts, and particularly in gardens.Many famous temple gardens were built early in this period, including Kinkaku-ji, The Golden Pavilion, built in 1398, and Ginkaku-ji, The Silver Pavilion, built in 1482. In some ways they followed Zen principles of spontaneity, extreme simplicity and moderation, but in other ways they were traditional Chinese Song-Dynasty Temples; the upper floors of the Golden Pavilion were covered with gold leaf, and they were surrounded by traditional water gardens.\nThe most notable garden style invented in this period was the zen garden, or Japanese rock garden. One of the finest examples, and one of the best-known of all Japanese gardens is Ry\u014dan-ji in Kyoto. This garden is just 9 meters wide and 24 meters long. It is composed of white sand carefully raked to suggest water, and fifteen rocks carefully arranged, like small islands. It is meant to be seen from a seated position on the porch of the residence the abbot of the monastery. There have been many debates about what the rocks are supposed to represent, but, as garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote, \"The garden at Ry\u014dan-ji does not symbolize. It does not have the value of representing any natural beauty that can be found in the world, real or mythical. I consider it as an abstract composition of \"natural\" objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite mediation.\"Several of the famous zen gardens of Kyoto were the work of one man; Mus\u014d Soseki (1275\u20131351). He was a monk, a ninth-generation descendant of the Emperor Uda. He was also a formidable court politician, writer and organizer, who armed and financed ships to open trade with China, and founded an organization called the Five Mountains, made up of the most powerful Zen monasteries in Kyoto. He was responsible for the building of the zen gardens of Nanzen-ji; Saih\u014d-ji (The Moss Garden); and Tenry\u016b-ji.\nNotable gardens of the Kamakura and Muromachi Periods include:\n\nKinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion)\nGinkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion)\nNanzen-ji\nSaih\u014d-ji (The Moss Garden)\nTenry\u016b-ji\nDaisen-in\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Momoyama period (1568\u20131600) ===\n\nThe Momoyama period was short, just 32 years, and was largely occupied with the wars between the daimy\u014ds, the leaders of the feudal Japanese clans. The new centers of power and culture in Japan were the fortified castles of the daimy\u014ds, around which new cities and gardens appeared. The characteristic garden of the period featured one or more ponds or lakes next to the main residence, or shoin, not far from the castle. These gardens were meant to be seen from above, from the castle or residence. The daimy\u014ds had developed the skills of cutting and lifting large rocks to build their castles, and they had armies of soldiers to move them. The artificial lakes were surrounded by beaches of small stones and decorated with arrangements of boulders, with natural stone bridges and stepping stones. The gardens of this period combined elements of a promenade garden, meant to be seen from the winding garden paths, with elements of the zen garden, such as artificial mountains, meant to be contemplated from a distance.The most famous garden of this kind, built in 1592, is situated near the Tokushima castle on the island of Shikoku. Its notable features include a bridge 10.5 meters long made of two natural stones.\nAnother notable garden of the period still existing is Sanb\u014d-in, rebuilt by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598 to celebrate the festival of the cherry blossom and to recreate the splendor of an ancient garden. Three hundred garden-builders worked on the project, digging the lakes and installing seven hundred boulders in a space of 540 square meters. The garden was designed to be seen from the veranda of the main pavilion, or from the \"Hall of the Pure View\", located on a higher elevation in the garden.\nIn the east of the garden, on a peninsula, is an arrangement of stones designed to represent the mythical Mount Horai. A wooden bridge leads to an island representing a crane, and a stone bridge connects this island to another representing a tortoise, which is connected by an earth-covered bridge back to the peninsula. The garden also includes a waterfall at the foot of a wooded hill. One characteristic of the Momoyama period garden visible at Sanb\u014d-in is the close proximity of the buildings to the water.The Momoyama period also saw the development of the chanoyu (tea ceremony), the chashitsu (teahouse), and the roji (tea garden). Tea had been introduced to Japan from China by Buddhist monks, who used it as a stimulant to keep awake during long periods of meditation. The first great tea master, Sen no Riky\u016b (1522\u20131591), defined in the most minute detail the appearance and rules of the tea house and tea garden, following the principle of wabi (\u4f98\u3073) \"sober refinement and calm\".Following Sen no Riky\u016b's rules, the teahouse was supposed to suggest the cottage of a hermit-monk. It was a small and very plain wooden structure, often with a thatched roof, with just enough room inside for two tatami mats. The only decoration allowed inside a scroll with an inscription and a branch of a tree. It did not have a view of the garden.\nThe garden was also small, and constantly watered to be damp and green. It usually had a cherry tree or elm to bring color in the spring, but otherwise did not have bright flowers or exotic plants that would distract the attention of the visitor. A path led to the entrance of the teahouse. Along the path was waiting bench for guests and a privy, and a stone water-basin near the teahouse, where the guests rinsed their hands and mouths before entering the tea room through a small, square door called nijiri-guchi, or \"crawling-in entrance\", which requires bending low to pass through. Sen no Riky\u016b decreed that the garden should be left unswept for several hours before the ceremony, so that leaves would be scattered in a natural way on the path.Notable gardens of the period include:\n\nTokushima Castle garden on the island of Shikoku.\nTai-an tea house at My\u014dki-an Temple in Kyoto, built in 1582 by Sen no Riky\u016b.\nSanb\u014d-in at Daigo-ji, in Kyoto Prefecture (1598)\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Edo period (1615\u20131867) ===\n\nDuring the Edo period, power was won and consolidated by the Tokugawa clan, who became the Shoguns, and moved the capital to Edo, which became Tokyo. During this time, Japan, except for the port of Nagasaki, was virtually closed to foreigners, and Japanese were not allowed to travel to any country except China or the Netherlands. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead leader, with authority only over cultural and religious affairs. While the political center of Japan was now Tokyo, Kyoto remained the cultural capital, the center for religion and art. The Shoguns provided the Emperors with little power, but with generous subsidies for building gardens.The Edo period saw the widespread use of a new kind of Japanese architecture, called Sukiya-zukuri, which means literally \"building according to chosen taste\". The term first appeared at the end of the 16th century referring to isolated tea houses. It originally applied to the simple country houses of samurai warriors and Buddhist monks, but in the Edo period it was used in every kind of building, from houses to palaces.\nThe Sukiya style was used in the most famous garden of the period, the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. The buildings were built in a very simple, undecorated style, a prototype for future Japanese architecture. They opened up onto the garden, so that the garden seemed entirely part of the building. Whether the visitor was inside or outside of the building, he always had a feeling he was in the center of nature. The garden buildings were arranged so that were always seen from a diagonal, rather than straight on. This arrangement had the poetic name ganko, which meant literally \"a formation of wild geese in flight\".Most of the gardens of the Edo period were either promenade gardens or dry rock zen gardens, and they were usually much larger than earlier gardens. The promenade gardens of the period made extensive use of borrowing of scenery (\"shakkei\"). Vistas of distant mountains are integrated in the design of the garden; or, even better, building the garden on the side of a mountain and using the different elevations to attain views over landscapes outside the garden. Edo promenade gardens were often composed of a series of meisho, or \"famous views\", similar to postcards. These could be imitations of famous natural landscapes, like Mount Fuji, or scenes from Taoist or Buddhist legends, or landscapes illustrating verses of poetry. Unlike zen gardens, they were designed to portray nature as it appeared, not the internal rules of nature.\nShugakuin Imperial Villa\nShisen-d\u014d (1641)\nSuizen-ji\nHama Rikyu\nK\u014draku-en (Okayama)\nRitsurin Garden (Takamatsu)\nKoishikawa K\u014draku-en (Tokyo) (1629)\nNinna-ji, Kyoto\nEnman-in, Otsu\nSanzen-in, north of Kyoto\nSengan-en, Kagoshima (1658)\nChishaku-in, southeast of Kyoto\nJ\u014dju-in, in the temple of Kiyomizu, southeast of Kyoto (1688\u20131703)\nManshu-in, northeast of Kyoto (1656)\nNanzen-ji, east of Kyoto (1688\u20131703)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji period (1868\u20131912) ===\nThe Meiji period saw the modernization of Japan, and the re-opening of Japan to the west. Many of the old private gardens had been abandoned and left to ruin. In 1871, a new law transformed many gardens from the earlier Edo period into public parks, preserving them. Garden designers, confronted with ideas from the West experimented with western styles, leading to such gardens as Kyu-Furukawa Gardens, or Shinjuku Gyoen. Others, more in the north of Japan kept to Edo period blueprint design. A third wave was the naturalistic style of gardens, invented by captains of industry and powerful politicians like Aritomo Yamagata. Many gardeners soon were designing and constructing gardens catering to this taste. One of the gardens well-known for his technical perfection in this style was Ogawa Jihei VII, also known as Ueji.Notable gardens of this period include:\n\nKyu-Furukawa Gardens\nKenroku-en, 18th and 19th centuries, finished in 1874.\nChinzan-so in Tokyo in 1877.\nMurin-an in Kyoto, finished 1898.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Japanese gardens (1912 to present) ===\nDuring the Showa period (1926\u20131989), many traditional gardens were built by businessmen and politicians. After World War II, the principal builders of gardens were no longer private individuals, but banks, hotels, universities and government agencies. The Japanese garden became an extension of the landscape architecture with the building. New gardens were designed by landscape architects, and often used modern building materials such as concrete.\nSome modern Japanese gardens, such as T\u014dfuku-ji, designed by Mirei Shigemori, were inspired by classical models. Other modern gardens have taken a much more radical approach to the traditions. One example is Awaji Yumebutai, a garden on the island of Awaji, in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, designed by Tadao Ando. It was built as part of a resort and conference center on a steep slope, where land had been stripped away to make an island for an airport.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Garden elements ==\nThe ability to capture the essence of nature makes the Japanese gardens distinctive and appealing to observers. Traditional Japanese gardens are very different in style from occidental gardens. The contrast between western flower gardens and Japanese gardens is profound. \"Western gardens are typically optimised for visual appeal while Japanese gardens are modelled with spiritual and philosophical ideas in mind.\" Japanese gardens have always been conceived as a representation of a natural setting. The Japanese have always had a spiritual connection with their land and the spirits that are one with nature, which explains why they prefer to incorporate natural materials in their gardens. Traditional Japanese gardens can be categorized into three types: tsukiyama (hill gardens), karesansui (dry gardens) and chaniwa gardens (tea gardens). The main purpose of a Japanese garden is to attempt to be a space that captures the natural beauties of nature.\nThe small space given to create these gardens usually poses a challenge for the gardeners. Due to the absolute importance of the arrangement of natural rocks and trees, finding the right material becomes highly selective. The serenity of a Japanese landscape and the simple but deliberate structures of the Japanese gardens are what truly make the gardens unique. \"The two main principles incorporated in a Japanese garden are scaled reduction and symbolization.\"\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nJapanese gardens always have water, either a pond or stream, or, in the dry rock garden, represented by white sand. In Buddhist symbolism, water and stone are the yin and yang, two opposites that complement and complete each other. A traditional garden will usually have an irregular-shaped pond or, in larger gardens, two or more ponds connected by a channel or stream, and a cascade, a miniature version of Japan's famous mountain waterfalls.\nIn traditional gardens, the ponds and streams are carefully placed according to Buddhist geomancy, the art of putting things in the place most likely to attract good fortune. The rules for the placement of water were laid out in the first manual of Japanese gardens, the Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\"), in the 11th century. According to the Sakuteiki, the water should enter the garden from the east or southeast and flow toward the west because the east is the home of the Green Dragon (seiryu) an ancient Chinese divinity adapted in Japan, and the west is the home of the White Tiger, the divinity of the east. Water flowing from east to west will carry away evil, and the owner of the garden will be healthy and have a long life. According to the Sakuteiki, another favorable arrangement is for the water to flow from north, which represents water in Buddhist cosmology, to the south, which represents fire, which are opposites (yin and yang) and therefore will bring good luck.The Sakuteiki recommends several possible miniature landscapes using lakes and streams: the \"ocean style\", which features rocks that appear to have been eroded by waves, a sandy beach, and pine trees; the \"broad river style\", recreating the course of a large river, winding like a serpent; the \"marsh pond\" style, a large still pond with aquatic plants; the \"mountain torrent style\", with many rocks and cascades; and the \"rose letters\" style, an austere landscape with small, low plants, gentle relief and many scattered flat rocks.\nTraditional Japanese gardens have small islands in the lakes. In sacred temple gardens, there is usually an island which represents Mount Penglai or Mount H\u014drai, the traditional home of the Eight Immortals.\nThe Sakuteiki describes different kinds of artificial island which can be created in lakes, including the \"mountainous island\", made up of jagged vertical rocks mixed with pine trees, surrounded by a sandy beach; the \"rocky island\", composed of \"tormented\" rocks appearing to have been battered by sea waves, along with small, ancient pine trees with unusual shapes; the \"cloud island\", made of white sand in the rounded white forms of a cumulus cloud; and the \"misty island\", a low island of sand, without rocks or trees.\nA cascade or waterfall is an important element in Japanese gardens, a miniature version of the waterfalls of Japanese mountain streams. The Sakuteiki describes seven kinds of cascades. It notes that if possible a cascade should face toward the moon and should be designed to capture the moon's reflection in the water. It is also mentioned in Sakuteiki that cascades benefit from being located in such a manner that they are half-hidden in shadows.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Rocks and sand ===\nRock, sand and gravel are an essential feature of the Japanese garden. A vertical rock may represent Mount Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals, or Mount Sumeru of Buddhist teaching, or a carp jumping from the water. A flat rock might represent the earth. Sand or gravel can represent a beach, or a flowing river. Rocks and water also symbolize yin and yang (in and y\u014d in Japanese) in Buddhist philosophy; the hard rock and soft water complement each other, and water, though soft, can wear away rock.\nRough volcanic rocks (kasei-gan) are usually used to represent mountains or as stepping stones. Smooth and round sedimentary rocks (suisei-gan) are used around lakes or as stepping stones. Hard metamorphic rocks are usually placed by waterfalls or streams. Rocks are traditionally classified as tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat. Rocks should vary in size and color but from each other, but not have bright colors, which would lack subtlety. Rocks with strata or veins should have the veins all going in the same direction, and the rocks should all be firmly planted in the earth, giving an appearance of firmness and permanence. Rocks are arranged in careful compositions of two, three, five or seven rocks, with three being the most common. In a three-arrangement, a tallest rock usually represents heaven, the shortest rock is the earth, and the medium-sized rock is humanity, the bridge between heaven and earth. Sometimes one or more rocks, called suteishi (\"nameless\" or \"discarded\"), are placed in seemingly random locations in the garden, to suggest spontaneity, though their placement is carefully chosen.In ancient Japan, sand (suna) and gravel (jari) were used around Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Later it was used in the Japanese rock garden or Zen Buddhist gardens to represent water or clouds. White sand represented purity, but sand could also be gray, brown or bluish-black.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSelection and subsequent placement of rocks was and still is a central concept in creating an aesthetically pleasing garden by the Japanese. During the Heian period, the concept of placing stones as symbolic representations of islands \u2013 whether physically existent or nonexistent \u2013 began to take hold, and can be seen in the Japanese word shima, which is of \"particular importance ... because the word contained the meaning 'island'\"  Furthermore, the principle of kowan ni shitagau, or \"obeying (or following) the request of an object\", was, and still is, a guiding principle of Japanese rock design that suggests \"the arrangement of rocks be dictated by their innate characteristics\". The specific placement of stones in Japanese gardens to symbolically represent islands (and later to include mountains), is found to be an aesthetically pleasing property of traditional Japanese gardens.\nHere are some of the aesthetic principles, as stated by Thomas Heyd:\n\nStones, which constitute a fundamental part of Japanese gardens, are carefully selected for their weathering and are placed in such a way that they give viewers the sense that they \u2018naturally\u2019 belong where they are, and in combinations in which the viewers [sic] find them. As such, this form of gardening attempts to emblematically represent (or present) the processes and spaces found in wild nature, away from city and practical concerns of human lifeRock placement is a general \"aim to portray nature in its essential characteristics\" \u2013 the essential goal of all Japanese gardens. Furthermore,\n\nwhile the cult of stones is also central to Japanese gardening \u2026 as stones were part of an aesthetic design and had to be placed so that their positions appeared natural and their relationships harmonious. The concentration of the interest on such detail as the shape of a rock or the moss on a stone lantern led at times to an overemphatic picturesqueness and accumulation of minor features that, to Western eyes accustomed to a more general survey, may seem cluttered and restless.Such attention to detail can be seen at places such as Midori Falls in Kenroku-en Garden in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, as the rocks at the waterfall's base were changed at various times by six different daimy\u014ds.\nIn Heian-period Japanese gardens, built in the Chinese model, buildings occupied as much or more space than the garden. The garden was designed to be seen from the main building and its verandas, or from small pavilions built for that purpose. In later gardens, the buildings were less visible. Rustic teahouses were hidden in their own little gardens, and small benches and open pavilions along the garden paths provided places for rest and contemplation. In later garden architecture, walls of houses and teahouses could be opened to provide carefully framed views of the garden. The garden and the house became one.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Garden bridges ===\nBridges first appeared in the Japanese garden during the Heian period. At By\u014dd\u014d-in garden in Kyoto, a wooden bridge connects the Phoenix pavilion with a small island of stones, representing the Mount Penglai or Mount Horai, the island home of the Eight Immortals of Daoist teaching, The bridge symbolized the path to paradise and immortality.Bridges could be made of stone (ishibashi), or of wood, or made of logs with earth on top, covered with moss (dobashi); they could be either arched (soribashi) or flat (hirabashi). Sometimes if they were part of a temple garden, they were painted red, following the Chinese tradition, but for the most part they were unpainted.During the Edo period, when large promenade gardens became popular, streams and winding paths were constructed, with a series of bridges, usually in a rustic stone or wood style, to take visitors on a tour of the scenic views of the garden.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Stone lanterns and water basins ===\n\nJapanese stone lanterns (\u53f0\u706f\u7c60, dai-d\u014dr\u014d, \"platform lamp\") date back to the Nara period and the Heian period. Originally they were located only at Buddhist temples, where they lined the paths and approaches to the temple, but in the Heian period they began to be used at Shinto shrines as well. According to tradition, during the Momoyama period they were introduced to the tea garden by the first great tea masters, and in later gardens they were used purely for decoration.\nIn its complete and original form, a dai-doro, like the pagoda, represents the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. The piece touching the ground represents chi, the earth; the next section represents sui, or water; ka or fire, is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while f\u016b (air) and k\u016b (void or spirit) are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky. The segments express the idea that after death our physical bodies will go back to their original, elemental form.Stone water basins (tsukubai) were originally placed in gardens for visitors to wash their hands and mouth before the tea ceremony. The water is provided to the basin by a bamboo pipe, or kakei, and they usually have a wooden ladle for drinking the water. In tea gardens, the basin was placed low to the ground, so the drinker had to bend over to get water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Garden fences, gates, and devices ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Trees and flowers ===\n\nNothing in a Japanese garden is natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen according to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, to serve as a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their season of flowering. Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the lotus, sacred in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.\nThe trees are carefully trimmed to provide attractive scenes, and to prevent them from blocking other views of the garden. Their growth is also controlled, in a technique called niwaki, to give them more picturesque shapes, and to make them look more ancient. It has been suggested that the characteristic shape of pruned Japanese garden trees resemble trees found naturally in savannah landscapes. This resemblance has been used to motivate the so called Savannah hypothesis. Trees are sometimes constrained to bend, in order to provide shadows or better reflections in the water. Very old pine trees are often supported by wooden crutches, or their branches are held by cords, to keep them from breaking under the weight of snow. \nIn the late 16th century, a new art was developed in the Japanese garden; that of \u014dkarikomi (\u5927\u5208\u8fbc), the technique of trimming bushes into balls or rounded shapes which imitate waves. According to tradition this art was developed by Kobori Ensh\u016b (1579\u20131647), and it was most frequently practiced on azalea bushes. It was similar to the topiary gardens made in Europe at the same time, except that European topiary gardens tried to make trees look like geometric solid objects, while \u014dkarkikomi sought to make bushes look as if they were almost liquid, or in flowing natural shapes. It created an artistic play of light on the surface of the bush, and, according to garden historian Michel Baridon, \"it also brought into play the sense of 'touching things' which even today succeeds so well in Japanese design.\"The most common trees and plants found in Japanese gardens are the azalea (tsutsuji), the camellia (tsubaki), the oak (kashiwa), the elm (nire), the Japanese apricot (ume), cherry (sakura), maple (momiji), the willow (yanagi), the ginkgo (ich\u014d), the Japanese cypress (hinoki), the Japanese cedar (sugi), pine (matsu), and bamboo (take).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Fish ===\n\nThe use of fish, particularly nishiki-goi (colored carp), or goldfish as a decorative element in gardens was borrowed from the Chinese garden. Goldfish were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding Prussian carp for color mutations. By the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), yellow, orange, white and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Koi were developed from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Japan in the 1820s. Koi are domesticated common carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely. In addition to fish, turtles are kept in some gardens. Natural environments in the gardens offer habitats that attract wild animals; frogs and birds are notable as they contribute with a pleasant soundscape.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Aesthetic principles ==\nThe early Japanese gardens largely followed the Chinese model, but gradually Japanese gardens developed their own principles and aesthetics. These were spelled out by a series of landscape gardening manuals, beginning with Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\") in the Heian Period (794\u20131185). The principles of sacred gardens, such as the gardens of Zen Buddhist temples, were different from those of pleasure or promenade gardens; for example, Zen Buddhist gardens were designed to be seen, while seated, from a platform with a view of the whole garden, without entering it, while promenade gardens were meant to be seen by walking through the garden and stopping at a series of view points. However, they often contain common elements and used the same techniques. Some basic principles are:\nMiniaturization. The Japanese garden is a miniature and idealized view of nature. Rocks can represent mountains, and ponds can represent seas. The garden is sometimes made to appear larger by placing larger rocks and trees in the foreground, and smaller ones in the background.\nConcealment (miegakure, \"hide and reveal\"). The Zen Buddhist garden is meant to be seen all at once, but the promenade garden is meant to be seen one landscape at a time, like a scroll of painted landscapes unrolling. Features are hidden behind hills, trees groves or bamboo, walls or structures, to be discovered when the visitor follows the winding path.\nBorrowed scenery (shakkei). Smaller gardens are often designed to incorporate the view of features outside the garden, such as hills, trees or temples, as part of the view. This makes the garden seem larger than it really is.\nAsymmetry. Japanese gardens are not laid on straight axes, or with a single feature dominating the view. Buildings and garden features are usually placed to be seen from a diagonal, and are carefully composed into scenes that contrast right angles, such as buildings with natural features, and vertical features, such as rocks, bamboo or trees, with horizontal features, such as water.According to garden historians David and Michigo Young, at the heart of the Japanese garden is the principle that a garden is a work of art. \"Though inspired by nature, it is an interpretation rather than a copy; it should appear to be natural, but it is not wild.\"Landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto wrote that the Japanese generate \"the best of nature's handiwork in a limited space\".\n\n\n== Differences between Japanese and Chinese gardens ==\nJapanese gardens during the Heian period were modeled upon Chinese gardens, but by the Edo period there were distinct differences.\nArchitecture. Chinese gardens have buildings in the center of the garden, occupying a large part of the garden space. The buildings are placed next to or over the central body of water. The garden buildings are very elaborate, with much architectural decoration. In later Japanese gardens, the buildings are well apart from the body of water, and the buildings are simple, with very little ornament. The architecture in a Japanese garden is largely or partly concealed.\nViewpoint. Chinese gardens are designed to be seen from the inside, from the buildings, galleries and pavilions in the center of the garden.  Japanese gardens are designed to be seen from the outside, as in the Japanese rock garden or zen garden; or from a path winding through the garden.\nUse of rocks. In a Chinese garden, particularly in the Ming dynasty, rocks were selected for their extraordinary shapes or resemblance to animals or mountains, and used for dramatic effect. They were often the stars and centerpieces of the garden. In later Japanese gardens, rocks were smaller and placed in more natural arrangements. integrated into the garden.Marine landscapes. Chinese gardens were inspired by Chinese inland landscapes, particularly Chinese lakes and mountains, while Japanese gardens often use miniaturized scenery from the Japanese coast. Japanese gardens frequently include white sand or pebble beaches and rocks which seem to have been worn by the waves and tide, which rarely appear in Chinese gardens.\n\n\n== Garden styles ==\n\n\n=== Chisen-shoy\u016b-teien or pond garden ===\nThe chisen-shoy\u016b-teien (\"lake-spring-boat excursion garden\") was imported from China during the Heian period (794\u20131185). It is also called the shinden-zukuri style, after the architectural style of the main building. It featured a large, ornate residence with two long wings reaching south to a large lake and garden. Each wing ended in a pavilion from which guests could enjoy the views of the lake. Visitors made tours of the lake in small boats. These gardens had large lakes with small islands, where musicians played during festivals and ceremonies worshippers could look across the water at the Buddha. No original gardens of this period remain, but reconstructions can be seen at Heian-jing\u016b and Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\n\n=== The Paradise Garden ===\nThe Paradise Garden appeared in the late Heian period, created by nobles belonging to the Amida Buddhism sect. They were meant to symbolize Paradise or the Pure Land (J\u014ddo), where the Buddha sat on a platform contemplating a lotus pond. These gardens featured a lake island called Nakajima, where the Buddha hall was located, connected to the shore by an arching bridge. The most famous surviving example is the garden of the Phoenix Hall of By\u014dd\u014d-in Temple, built in 1053, in Uji, near Kyoto. Other examples are J\u014druri-ji temple in Kyoto, Enro-ji temple in Nara Prefecture, the Hokongoin in Kyoto, M\u014dts\u016b-ji Temple in Hiraizumi, and Shiramizu Amidado Garden in Iwaki City.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Karesansui dry rock gardens ===\nKaresansui gardens (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34) or Japanese rock gardens, became popular in Japan in the 14th century thanks to the work of a Buddhist monk, Mus\u014d Soseki (1275\u20131351) who built zen gardens at the five major monasteries in Kyoto. These gardens have white sand or raked gravel in place of water, carefully arranged rocks, and sometimes rocks and sand covered with moss. Their purpose is to facilitate meditation, and they are meant to be viewed while seated on the porch of the residence of the h\u014dj\u014d, the abbot of the monastery. The most famous example is Ry\u014dan-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Roji, or tea gardens ===\nThe tea garden was created during the Muromachi period (1333\u20131573) and Momoyama period (1573\u20131600) as a setting for the Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu. The style of garden takes its name from the roji, or path to the teahouse, which is supposed to inspire the visitor to meditation to prepare him for the ceremony. There is an outer garden, with a gate and covered arbor where guests wait for the invitation to enter. They then pass through a gate to the inner garden, where they wash their hands and rinse their mouth, as they would before entering a Shinto shrine, before going into the teahouse itself. The path is always kept moist and green, so it will look like a remote mountain path, and there are no bright flowers that might distract the visitor from his meditation. Early teahouses had no windows, but later teahouses have a wall which can be opened for a view of the garden.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kaiy\u016b-shiki-teien, or promenade gardens ===\nPromenade or stroll gardens (landscape gardens in the go-round style) appeared in Japan during the Edo period (1600\u20131854), at the villas of nobles or warlords. These gardens were designed to complement the houses in the new sukiya-zukuri style of architecture, which were modeled after the teahouse. These gardens were meant to be seen by following a path clockwise around the lake from one carefully composed scene to another. These gardens used two techniques to provide interest: borrowed scenery (\"shakkei\"), which took advantage of views of scenery outside the garden such as mountains or temples, incorporating them into the view so the garden looked larger than it really was, and miegakure, or \"hide-and-reveal\", which used winding paths, fences, bamboo and buildings to hide the scenery so the visitor would not see it until he was at the best view point.\nEdo period gardens also often feature recreations of famous scenery or scenes inspired by literature; Suizen-ji J\u014dju-en Garden in Kumamoto has a miniature version of Mount Fuji, and Katsura Villa in Kyoto has a miniature version of the Ama-no-hashidate sandbar in Miyazu Bay, near Kyoto. The Rikugi-en Garden in Tokyo creates small landscapes inspired by eighty-eight famous Japanese poems.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Small urban gardens ===\n\nSmall gardens were originally found in the interior courtyards (naka-niwa, \"inner garden\") of Heian period palaces, and were designed to give a glimpse of nature and some privacy to the residents of the rear side of the building. They were as small as one tsubo, or about 3.3 square meters, whence the name tsubo-niwa. During the Edo period, merchants began building small gardens in the space behind their shops, which faced the street, and their residences, located at the rear. These tiny gardens were meant to be seen, not entered, and usually had a stone lantern, a water basin, stepping stones and a few plants. Today, tsubo-niwa are found in many Japanese residences, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings. A good example from the Meiji period is found in the villa of Murin-an in Kyoto. Totekiko is a famous courtyard rock garden.\n\n\n=== Hermitage garden ===\n\nA hermitage garden is a small garden usually built by a samurai or government official who wanted to retire from public life and devote himself to study or meditation. It is attached to a rustic house, and approached by a winding path, which suggests it is deep in a forest. It may have a small pond, a Japanese rock garden, and the other features of traditional gardens, in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. An example is the Shisen-d\u014d garden in Kyoto, built by a bureaucrat and scholar exiled by the shogun in the 17th century. It is now a Buddhist temple.\n\n\n== Literature and art of the Japanese garden ==\n\n\n=== Garden manuals ===\nThe first manual of Japanese gardening was the Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\"), probably written in the late eleventh century by Tachibana no Tohshitsuna (1028\u20131094). Citing even older Chinese sources, it explains how to organize the garden, from the placement of rocks and streams to the correct depth of ponds and height of cascades. While it was based on earlier Chinese garden principles, it also expressed ideas which were unique to Japanese gardens, such as islands, beaches and rock formations imitating Japanese maritime landscapes.Besides giving advice, Sakuteiki also gives dire warnings of what happens if the rules are not followed; the author warns that if a rock that in nature was in a horizontal position is stood upright in a garden, it will bring misfortune to the owner of the garden. And, if a large rock pointed toward the north or west is placed near a gallery, the owner of the garden will be forced to leave before a year passes.Another influential work about the Japanese garden, bonseki, bonsai and related arts was Rhymeprose on a Miniature Landscape Garden (around 1300) by the Zen monk Kokan Shiren, which explained how meditation on a miniature garden purified the senses and the mind and led to understanding of the correct relationship between man and nature.\nOther influential garden manuals which helped to define the aesthetics of the Japanese garden are Senzui Narabi ni Yagyo no Zu (Illustrations for Designing Mountain, Water and Hillside Field Landscapes), written in the fifteenth century, and Tsukiyama Teizoden (Building Mountains and Making Gardens), from the 18th century. The tradition of Japanese gardening was historically passed down from sensei to apprentice. The opening words of Illustrations for designing mountain, water and hillside field landscapes (1466) are \"If you have not received the oral transmissions, you must not make gardens\" and its closing admonition is \"You must never show this writing to outsiders. You must keep it secret\".These garden manuals are still studied today.\n\n\n=== Gardens in literature and poetry ===\nThe Tale of Genji, the classic Japanese novel of the Heian period, describes the role of the Japanese garden in court life. The characters attend festivals in the old Kyoto imperial palace garden, take boat trips on the lake, listen to music and watch formal dances under the trees.Gardens were often the subject of poems during the Heian period. A poem in one anthology from the period, the Kokin-Shu, described the Kiku-shima, or island of chrystanthemums, found in the Osawa pond in the great garden of the period called Saga-in.\n\nI had thought that here\nonly one chrysanthmum can grow.\nWho therefore has planted\nthe other in the depths\nof the pond of Osawa?Another poem of the Heian period, in the Hyakunin isshu, described a cascade of rocks, which simulated a waterfall, in the same garden:\n\nThe cascade long ago\nceased to roar,\nBut we continue to hear\nThe murmur\nof its name.\n\n\n=== Philosophy, painting, and the Japanese garden ===\n\nIn Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, equal to the arts of calligraphy and ink painting. Gardens are considered three-dimensional textbooks of Daoism and Zen Buddhism. Sometimes the lesson is very literal; the garden of Saih\u014d-ji featured a pond shaped like the Japanese character shin (\u5fc3) or x\u012bn in Chinese, the heart-spirit of Chinese philosophy, the newspaper character is \u5fc3 but it's the full cursive, the sousho style (\u8349\u66f8) for shin that would be used; sousho, this well-named \"grass writing\", would be appropriate for gardening purpose indeed, for in cursive writing the character shapes change depending on the context and of course, since it is cursive, depending on the person -that is to say that the character would be done in a single pencil stroke, it would match the state of mind and the context rather than the newspaper print.\nHowever, usually the lessons are contained in the arrangements of the rocks, the water and the plants. For example, the lotus flower has a particular message; Its roots are in the mud at the bottom of the pond, symbolizing the misery of the human condition, but its flower is pure white, symbolizing the purity of spirit that can be achieved by following the teachings of the Buddha.\nThe Japanese rock gardens were intended to be intellectual puzzles for the monks who lived next to them to study and solve. They followed the same principles as the suiboku-ga, the black-and-white Japanese inks paintings of the same period, which, according to Zen Buddhist principles, tried to achieve the maximum effect using the minimum essential elements.\n\nOne painter who influenced the Japanese garden was Josetsu (1405\u20131423), a Chinese Zen monk who moved to Japan and introduced a new style of ink-brush painting, moving away from the romantic misty landscapes of the earlier period, and using asymmetry and areas of white space, similar to the white space created by sand in zen gardens, to set apart and highlight a mountain or tree branch or other element of his painting. He became chief painter of the Shogun and influenced a generation of painters and garden designers.Japanese gardens also follow the principles of perspective of Japanese landscape painting, which feature a close-up plane, an intermediate plane, and a distant plane. The empty space between the different planes has a great importance, and is filled with water, moss, or sand. The garden designers used various optical tricks to give the garden the illusion of being larger than it really is, by borrowing of scenery (\"shakkei\"), employing distant views outside the garden, or using miniature trees and bushes to create the illusion that they are far away.\n\n\n== Noteworthy Japanese gardens ==\n\n\n=== In Japan ===\n\nThe Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of the government of Japan designates the most notable of the nation's scenic beauty as Special Places of Scenic Beauty, under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. As of March 2007, 29 sites are listed, more than a half of which are Japanese gardens (boldface entries specify World Heritage Sites):\n\nT\u014dhoku region\nM\u014dts\u016b-ji Garden (Hiraizumi, Iwate)\nKant\u014d region\nKairaku-en (Mito, Ibaraki)\nRikugi-en (Bunky\u014d, Tokyo)\nKyu Hamarikyu Gardens (Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo)\nCh\u016bbu region\nKenroku-en (Kanazawa, Ishikawa)\nIchij\u014ddani Asakura Family Gardens (Fukui, Fukui)\nKansai region\nBy\u014dd\u014d-in Garden (Uji, Kyoto)\nJisho-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nNij\u014d Castle Ninomaru Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nRokuon-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nRy\u014dan-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nTenry\u016b-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe garden of Sanb\u014din in Daigo-ji (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe moss garden of Saih\u014d-ji (the \"Moss Temple\") (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nDaitoku-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe garden of Daisen-in in Daitoku-ji (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nMurin-an garden, Kyoto, Kyoto\nNegoro-ji Garden (Iwade, Wakayama)\nCh\u016bgoku region\nAdachi Museum of Art Garden (Yasugi, Shimane)\nK\u014draku-en (Okayama, Okayama)\nMatsue Vogel Park (Matsue)\nSh\u016braku-en (Tsuyama)\nShikoku Region\nRitsurin Garden (Takamatsu, Kagawa)\nNakatsu Banshoen (Marugame, Kagawa)\nTensha-en (Uwajima, Ehime)\nKyushu Region\nSuizen-ji J\u014dju-en (Kumamoto, Kumamoto)\nSengan-en (Kagoshima, Kagoshima)\nRy\u016bky\u016b Islands\nShikina-en (Naha, Okinawa)However, the Education Minister is not eligible to have jurisdiction over any imperial property. These two gardens, administered by Imperial Household Agency, are also considered to be great masterpieces.\n\nKatsura Imperial Villa\nShugaku-in Imperial Villa\n\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\n\nSeveral Japanese gardens were built during Japanese Taiwan period.\n\nTaipei Guest House\nBeitou Plum Garden, in Beitou, Taipei\nBeitou Museum, in Beitou, Taipei\n\n\n=== In English-speaking countries ===\n\nThe aesthetic of Japanese gardens was introduced to the English-speaking community by Josiah Conder's Landscape Gardening in Japan (Kelly & Walsh, 1893). It sparked the first Japanese gardens in the West. A second edition was required in 1912. Conder's principles have sometimes proved hard to follow:\n\nRobbed of its local garb and mannerisms, the Japanese method reveals aesthetic principles applicable to the gardens of any country, teaching, as it does, how to convert into a poem or picture a composition, which, with all its variety of detail, otherwise lacks unity and intent.\nSamuel Newsom's Japanese Garden Construction (1939) offered Japanese aesthetic as a corrective in the construction of rock gardens, which owed their quite separate origins in the West to the mid-19th century desire to grow alpines in an approximation of Alpine scree.\nAccording to the Garden History Society, Japanese landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto was involved in the development of around 200 gardens in the UK. In 1937 he exhibited a rock garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, and worked on the Burngreave Estate at Bognor Regis, and also on a Japanese garden at Cottered in Hertfordshire. The lush courtyards at Du Cane Court \u2013 an art deco block of flats in Balham, London, built between 1935 and 1938 \u2013 were designed by Kusumoto. All four courtyards there may have originally contained ponds. Only one survives, and this is stocked with koi. There are also several stone lanterns, which are meant to symbolise the illumination of one's path through life; similarly, the paths through the gardens are not straight. Japanese maple, Japanese anemone, cherry trees, evergreens, and bamboo are other typical features of Du Cane Court's gardens.According to David A. Slawson, many of the Japanese gardens that are recreated in the US are of \"museum-piece quality\". He also writes, however, that as the gardens have been introduced into the Western world, they have become more Americanized, decreasing their natural beauty.\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nAdelaide Himeji Garden\nAuburn Botanical Gardens, in Sydney, New South Wales\nCanberra Nara Peace Park in Lennox Gardens, Canberra\nCowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre, Cowra, New South Wales\nMelbourne Zoo\nNerima Gardens, Ipswich\nRoyal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, Hobart\n\"Tsuki-yama-chisen\" Japanese Garden, Brisbane\nUniversity of Southern Queensland Japanese Garden, \"Ju Raku En\", Toowomba, Queensland\n\n\n==== Canada ====\n\nNitobe Memorial Garden, Vancouver, British Columbia\nThe University of Alberta Botanic Garden, Edmonton, Alberta, formerly named the Devonian Botanic Garden, which contains an extensive Japanese garden\nNikka Yuko Japanese Garden, Lethbridge, Alberta\nThe Japanese Garden and Pavilion, Montreal Botanical Garden, Quebec\nKariya Park, Mississauga, Ontario\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nEngland\n\nCompton Acres, Dorset\nDartington Hall, Devon\nHall Park, Leeds\nHarewood House, Leeds\nHolland Park, London\nSt Mawgan in Pydar, Cornwall\nTatton Park, Cheshire\nSchool of Oriental and African Studies, LondonNorthern Ireland\n\nSir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park, Belfast\nFujiyama Japanese GardenScotland\n\nLauriston Castle, Edinburgh \u2013 garden opened 2002\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\n\nThe Japanese Gardens at the Irish National Stud, Kildare, Co.

        "wiki": "Staff Sergeant Reckless (c. 1948 \u2013 May 13, 1968), a decorated war horse who held official rank in the United States military, was a mare of Mongolian horse breeding.  Out of a race horse dam, she was purchased in October 1952 for $250 from a Korean stableboy at the Seoul racetrack who needed money to buy an artificial leg for his sister.  Reckless was bought by members of the United States Marine Corps and trained to be a pack horse for the Recoilless Rifle Platoon, Anti-Tank Company, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. She quickly became part of the unit and was allowed to roam freely through camp, entering the Marines' tents, where she would sleep on cold nights, and was known for her willingness to eat nearly anything, including scrambled eggs, beer, Coca-Cola and, once, about $30 worth of poker chips.\nShe served in numerous combat actions during the Korean War, carrying supplies and ammunition, and was also used to evacuate wounded.  Learning each supply route after only a couple of trips, she often traveled to deliver supplies to the troops on her own, without benefit of a handler. The highlight of her nine-month military career came in late March 1953 during the Battle for Outpost Vegas when, in a single day, she made 51 solo trips to resupply multiple front line units. She was wounded in combat twice, given the battlefield rank of corporal in 1953, and then a battlefield promotion to sergeant in 1954, several months after the war ended.  She also became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing, and following the war was awarded two Purple Hearts, a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, was included in her unit's Presidential Unit Citations from two countries, as well as other military honors.\nHer wartime service record was featured in The Saturday Evening Post, and LIFE magazine recognized her as one of America's 100 all-time heroes. She was retired and brought to the United States after the war, where she made appearances on television and participated in the United States Marine Corps birthday ball. She was officially promoted to staff sergeant in 1959 by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  She gave birth to four foals in America and died in May 1968. A plaque and photo were dedicated in her honor at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton stables and a statue of her was dedicated on July 26, 2013 at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia. On May 12, 2018, a bronze statue of Sergeant Reckless was placed and dedicated in the Kentucky Horse Park, Lexington Kentucky.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nSergeant Reckless was chestnut colored with a blaze and three white stockings. Her date of birth and parentage are unconfirmed, but she was estimated to be around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk-moon (\uae40\ud601\ubb38 or \uae40\ud751\ubb38), though that was not his real name. The horse was known as originally named \"\uc544\uce68\ud574\" (Ah Chim Hai, Korean pronunciation: [a tsim h\u00e6]) in Korean, which translates to \"Morning Sun\" or \"Sun-of-the-Morning\", also known as \"\uc5ec\uba85\" (Yeo Myeong) in Korean, which translates to \"light of dawn\", \"Morning Flame\" or \"Flame-of-the-Morning\" also reputed to be the name of her dam, a racehorse at the track in Seoul. Kim Huk-moon sold the horse, whom he had nicknamed \"Flame\", to Lieutenant Eric Pedersen for $250 in order to buy a leg prosthesis for his sister, who had stepped on a land mine. The horse's breeding was thought to be primarily Mongolian though she did have some features, particularly the shape of her head, that were similar to horses of Thoroughbred lineage. She was small, standing only 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm) and weighing 900 pounds (410 kg).\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\nIn October 1952, Pedersen received permission from Colonel Eustace P. Smoak to purchase a horse for his platoon. Based in mountainous terrain, Pederson needed a pack animal capable of carrying up to nine of the heavy 24-pound shells needed to supply the recoilless rifles used by his unit, the Recoilless Rifle Platoon of the 5th Marine Regiment. The day after he received permission, on  October 26, 1952, Pedersen, Sergeant Willard Berry, and Corporal Philip Carter drove a jeep with a trailer to the Seoul racetrack. Pedersen paid for the horse with his own money. Moon was reluctant to sell the horse, though he needed to, and cried when \"Flame\" departed.  The Marines renamed her \"Reckless\" as a contraction of the name of the Recoilless rifle and a nod to the daredevil attitude associated with those who used the gun.Her primary trainer and the person Reckless was closest to was platoon Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Latham. Private First Class Monroe Coleman was her primary caretaker. In addition to Pedersen, Latham, and Coleman, Lieutenant Bill Riley and Sergeant Elmer Lively were also involved with the training and care of Reckless. Pedersen had his wife ship a pack saddle from their home in California so Reckless could better fulfill her primary role as a pack animal. The recoilless rifle platoon had its own medical corpsman, Navy Hospitalman First Class George \"Doc\" Mitchell, who provided the majority of medical care for Reckless.The Marines, especially Latham, taught Reckless battlefield survival skills such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, \"incoming!\" The platoon called it her \"hoof training\" and \"hoof camp\". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond of a wide variety of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day.  Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.\n\nReckless's baptism under fire came at a place called Hedley's Crotch, near the villages of Changdan and Kwakchan. Though loaded down with six  recoilless rifle shells, she initially \"went straight up\" and all four feet left the ground the first time the Recoilless Rifle was fired. When she landed she started shaking, but Coleman, her handler, calmed her down.  The second time the gun fired she merely snorted, and by the end of the mission that day appeared calm and was seen trying to eat a discarded helmet liner. She even appeared to take an interest in the operation of the weapon. When learning a new delivery route, Reckless would only need someone to lead her a few times. Afterwards she would make the trips on her own. There was a standing order not to ride Reckless, but in early December 1952, someone violated that order and took Reckless on a ride that included a sprint through a minefield. She was not injured during the unauthorized ride.Her most significant accomplishment came during the Battle of Panmunjom-Vegas (also known as the Battle of Outpost Vegas/Vegas Hill) over the period March 26\u201328, 1953, when she made 51 solo trips in a single day, carrying a total of 386 recoilless rounds (over 9,000 pounds, carrying 4 to 8 24-pound shells on each trip) covering over 35 miles that day. The whole Battle of Vegas lasted 3 days. She was wounded twice during the battle: once when she was hit by shrapnel over the left eye and another time on her left flank.  For her accomplishments during the Battle of Vegas Hill, Reckless was promoted to corporal.\n\nWhen not on the front lines, Reckless packed other items for the platoon, and was particularly useful for stringing telephone wire. Carrying reels of wire on her pack that were played out as she walked, she could string as much wire as twelve men on foot. She became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing when the 5th moved from Camp Casey to Inchon, planning to participate in amphibious landings hundreds of miles south of Inchon. The commanding officer of the transport halted loading operations when he saw the platoon on the dock with Reckless. He refused to take her on board his clean ship, which had won an award for being the cleanest ship in the previous two years. She was allowed on board after the Marines produced the loading plan, approved by him, which specifically listed Reckless and her equipment. Once the ship was underway, she became sick, making a mess on the ship's decks during the first part of the voyage. She could not be disembarked due to a storm, but soon became accustomed to the motion of the ship at sea and had no more problems. The 1st Marine Division was moved to a rest area soon after the move, and while there some platoon members posed with Reckless and a sign challenging the Thoroughbred Native Dancer to a race. They called their race the \"Paddy Derby\", the field \"Upsan Downs\", and the conditions differed from a typical horse race: 1.5 miles over paddies and hills, carrying 192 pounds of ammunition, and no riders. The Marines never received a reply; Native Dancer came in second in the Kentucky Derby, and went on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.Randolph M. Pate, then the commander of the 1st Marine Division, gave Reckless a battlefield promotion from corporal to sergeant in a formal ceremony, complete with reviewing stand, on April 10, 1954, several months after the war ended. She was also given a red and gold blanket with insignia. Reckless was promoted again, to staff sergeant (E-6), on August 31, 1959, at Camp Pendleton, California. This promotion was also awarded by Pate, then the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Pate personally presided over the ceremony, and Reckless was honored with a 19-gun salute and a 1,700-man parade of Marines from her wartime unit. She was an early example of an animal holding official rank in a branch of the United States military.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\n\nFor her exemplary service to the Marine Corps, Reckless was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds received during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation with bronze star, the National Defense Service Medal, a Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Korea Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. She would wear these awards on her horse blanket, plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.An article in The Saturday Evening Post, published on April 17, 1954, while Reckless was still in Korea, resulted in a campaign by American supporters to get the Marines to bring her to the United States. An executive at Pacific Transport Lines, Stan Coppel, read the article and offered to let Reckless ride free on one of his company's ships from Yokohama to San Francisco. Prior to her departure for America, a ceremony, including a band, for Reckless' rotation to the United States was held during half time of a football game between the Marine Corps and Army. Reckless left Korea  for Japan aboard a 1st Marine Aircraft Wing transport plane. She then sailed from Yokohama on October 22 aboard the SS Pacific Transport, due in San Francisco on November 5, 1954. A typhoon delayed the ship's arrival until the evening of November 9. Reckless and her caretakers stayed aboard until the next morning. Reckless got sick during the storm and was once knocked out of her stall onto the deck by the storm, which happened near the end of the trip. \n\nReckless's entry into the United States was not without its challenges. The Customs Bureau was not much of a problem but the United States Department of Agriculture insisted a medical check and lab tests be completed before she disembarked from the ship once it reached San Francisco, which would make her late for the Marine banquet where she was to be the guest of honor. The Marines contacted Agriculture Department officials in Washington, D.C. who agreed to allow her off the ship after her blood was drawn for lab tests, with the understanding that if she had glanders or dourine, she would be destroyed or sent back to Japan. Many of the Marines who actually knew her were incensed at what they considered an affront to her honor when they learned that dourine was an equine sexually transmitted disease. The night before she arrived, she once again ate her blanket, but a new one with ribbons and insignia was made just in time for her disembarkation. She was led off the ship by Lieutenant Pedersen and set foot on American soil in San Francisco on November 10, 1954, coincidentally the birthday of the  Marine Corps. For the Marine Corps Birthday Ball held that day, she rode an elevator, and then ate both cake and the flower decorations.\n\nReckless was kept by Pedersen's family for a brief time before moving to a more permanent home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.Reckless was well cared for and treated as a VIP during her time at Camp Pendleton. The Marine Corps was also careful not to allow her to be exploited by commercial interests. She produced four foals there: colts Fearless (1957), Dauntless (1959), and Chesty (1964); her last foal, a filly born circa 1965\u20131966, died a month after birth and was unnamed. Her offspring Chesty was named after Chesty Puller, one of the few Marines ever allowed to ride Reckless. Puller was a Marine Corps lieutenant general and the most decorated United States Marine of all time. Reckless retired from active service with full military honors at Camp Pendleton on November 10, 1960. She was provided free quarters and feed in lieu of retirement pay, per Marine Corps documents.\n\nReckless developed arthritis in her back as she aged and injured herself on May 13, 1968, by falling into a barbed wire fence. She died under sedation while her wounds were being treated. At the time of her death, she was estimated to be 19 or 20 years old. There is a plaque and photo commemorating her at the Camp Pendleton stables. The first race at Aqueduct racetrack, New York, was designated \"The Sgt Reckless\" on November 10, 1989. In 1997, Reckless was listed by LIFE magazine as one of America's 100 all-time heroes.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nA statue by sculptor Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition shells and other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, one day before the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her tail hair in the base of the statue. The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: \"The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, was something else to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted in my head and heart forever.\"A memorial to Sergeant Reckless at Camp Pendleton was dedicated on October 26, 2016.  The monument was created by Jocelyn Russell.  It is similar to the one located at the National Museum of the Marine Corps.A memorial to Sergeant Reckless at Yeoncheon Gorangpogu History Park (Near Battlefield of Outpost Vegas Battle) was dedicated in 2018\n\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\nSource:\n\n \nOn 28 July 2016, Sergeant Reckless was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal for her service between 1952 and 1953.In November 2019 she became one of the first recipients of the new American equivalent of the Dickin Medal, the Animals in War & Peace Medal of Bravery.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nReckless 1953: Horse Musical Show by Korea Racing Authority\nBrooklyn Nine Nine: Sergeant Peanut Butter from S01E13 is inspired by Reckless\n\n\n== See also ==\nHorses in warfare\nJudy (dog)\nWojtek (bear)\nUnsinkable Sam\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBarrett, Janet (2014).

        "wiki": "Kanazawa-ku (\u91d1\u6ca2\u533a) is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward had an estimated population of 209,565 and a density of 6,760 persons per km\u00b2. The total area was 31.01 km2 (11.97 sq mi). The ward symbol, established 1987, expresses the image of sea, waves, and a sea gull.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area around present-day Kanazawa Ward has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the J\u014dmon period at numerous locations in the area. Under the Nara period Ritsury\u014d system, it became part of Kuraki District in Musashi Province. By the Kamakura period it was part of a sh\u014den controlled by the H\u014dj\u014d clan, who established a major seaport for the Kamakura shogunate at Mutsuura, and a noted library and educational center at Kanazawa Bunko.\nDuring the Edo period, much of the area was part of the tenry\u014d territory in Musashi Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. In 1726, a large portion of the present ward came under the control of the newly established Mutsuura Domain ruled by the Yonekura clan.  The area consisted of small farming and fishing villages. During the Bakumatsu period, the area offshore Kanazawa was an anchorage for the American black ships under command of Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and 1854. After the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858, it was one of the first areas in Japan opened to foreign trade. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system following the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of Kuraki District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1887, It\u014d Hirobumi and a group of political scholars completed the final drafts of the Meiji Constitution while secluded in an inn in Kanazawa.  In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. The area was connected by rail to Yokohama with the opening of the Sh\u014dnan Electric Railway (the predecessor of the modern Keihin Electric Express Railway in 1930. In October 1936, Kuraki District was abolished, and the area was absorbed into Yokohama City, becoming part of Isogo Ward.  A large railway carriage factory was established in Kanazawa Ward in 1946 by the Tokyu Corporation on the site of a former Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Center. Kanazawa Ward gained its independence from Isogo Ward in May 1948.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKanazawa Ward is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and in the southeast corner of the city of Yokohama.

        "wiki": "Kawasaki (\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02, Kawasaki-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the 8th most populated city in Japan (including the Tokyo Metropolitan Area) and one of the main cities forming the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihin Industrial Area.As of October 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 1,503,690, with 716,470 households, and a population density of 10,000 persons per km2. Kawasaki is the only city in Japan with more than one million inhabitants that is not a prefectural capital. The total area is 142.70 km2 (55.10 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and Ancient era ===\nArchaeological evidence from the Japanese Paleolithic and J\u014dmon period can only be found in the northwest Tama Hills. The course of the Tama and the coast of the Bay of Tokyo have also changed in historical times, so that large parts of the urban area are geologically young.\n\n\n=== Classical era ===\n\n\n==== Nara period to the Sengoku period ====\nWith the introduction of the Ritsury\u014d legal system, the area came to the Musashi Province in the 7th century. In the Nara period, the center of the Tachibana district was probably in the area of today's Takatsu district. Since the Heian period, the domain of the Inage clan has expanded here. Around the Heiken-ji Buddhist temple (better known as Kawasaki-Daishi), founded in 1128, a monzen-machi, a busy district for the supply of pilgrims, soon emerged. Between the Kamakura period and Sengoku period, smaller feudal lords ruled the area until it finally came under the control of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan.\n\n\n=== Early Modern ===\nIn 1611, Koizumi Jiday\u016b had Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui built, a canal system on the right bank of the Tama for irrigating the fields, which in some cases still runs through the densely built-up city. On the long-distance Kaid\u014d roads T\u014dkaid\u014d and Nakaharakaid\u014d built by Edo-Bakufu, stations were built in the area of what would later become Kawasaki, which increased its importance. The Kawasaki station (Kawasaki-juku, near today's Kawasaki station) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d was not officially recognized until 1623 as the last of the 53 T\u014dkaid\u014d stations. The Bakufu let the bridges over the Tama collapse and there were ferry connections to nearby Edo in several places in today's Kawasaki, which laid the foundation for the development of the city.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nThe rapid urbanization of the area, which continues to this day, began in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras. In 1872, Kawasaki Station was established on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line which was Japan's first railway line. In 1889, the city (machi) Kawasaki in the district (gun) Tachibana was created according to the Japanese municipal system introduced the year before. In 1912 the border between Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures was established in the Tama. On July 1, 1924, the independent city (shi-) of Kawasaki with 48,394 inhabitants was formed through a merger with the city of Daishi (formerly Daishigawara) and the village of Miyuki.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAs part of World War II, the city was bombed three times by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between April 1945 and July 1945. The most serious attack was an area bombing with Napalm bombs on April 15, 1945. The attacks destroyed around 35% of the urban area and claimed 1,520 dead and 8,759 injured. The attacks burned down 9.3 km\u00b2 of the city (see Bombing of Tokyo).\n\n\n=== Contemporary period ===\n\n\n==== Sh\u014dwa era (1945\u20131989) ====\nOn April 15, 1945, large parts of the area around the train station and the industrial area at the port were destroyed by air raids. Since the 1950s, residential areas for commuters have been created in the northeastern part of the city, which are connected directly to the centers of Tokyo by new railway lines. On April 1, 1972, Kawasaki became a decree-designated city (seirei shitei toshi) with 5 districts. 1973 the population exceeded the million mark. In 1982 the new districts of Miyamae and Asao were created by splitting off from the districts of Takatsu and Tama. In the course of deindustrialization, industrial areas have recently been increasingly converted into residential areas (mostly Multi-family residential), so that a further increase in population density can be expected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nKawasaki is located on the right bank of the Tama River, which flows into the Tokyo Bay here. The city lies like a narrow band between Tokyo in the northeast and Yokohama in the southwest. The city connects the two major cities and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world.\nThe eastern area along the coast of Tokyo Bay is a densely populated industrial zone, part of the Keihin Industrial Zone. In contrast, the western districts in the Tama Hills consist largely of residential areas for commuters in the Tokyo / Yokohama region.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKawasaki has seven wards (ku):\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and towns ===\nIn the northeast, Kawasaki borders the Special wards of Tokyo (starting at Tokyo Bay) \u014cta and Setagaya, in the northwest the cities (-shi) belonging to Tokyo Prefecture (-shi) Komae, Chofu, Machida, Inagi, Tama enclose the place. The opposite southwest side is entirely occupied by the districts of Tsurumi, K\u014dhoku, Tsuzuki and Aoba in the city of Yokohama. With the completion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, the city of Kisarazu, located on the opposite side of the Tokyo Bay in Chiba Prefecture, also became a neighbor in December 1997.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nTwo rivers cross the urban area. The Tama unites with the tributaries Misawa, Yamashita, Gotanda, Nikary\u014d main river and Hirase; Katahira, Asao, Shimpukuji, Arima, E, Shibu and Yabumi flow into the Tsurumi.\nThe land on the coast of the city is crossed by a network of canals (Tama Canal, Suehiro Canal, Chidori Canal, Yak\u014d Canal, Daishi Canal, Mizue Canal, Shiohama Canal, Iriesaki Canal, Asano Canal, Ikegami Canal, Minami-Watarida Canal, Tanabe Canal, Shiraishi Canal and the Sakai Canal). In addition, the historic Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui canal still exists in the hinterland.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\nKawasaki is governed by Mayor Norihiko Fukuda, an independent elected on 27 October 2013. The city assembly has 63 elected members. Mayor Fukuda was re-elected to a second term in office on 22 October 2017 with support from LDP and K\u014dmeit\u014d against former municipal MP Akiko Yoshizawa and KPJ-supported former primary school teacher Hirokazu Ichiko.The 60-member city parliament of Kawasaki was re-elected in the unified elections in April 2019. The LDP remained the strongest with 19 seats.Kawasaki was in June 2008 the second Japanese \"government-designated city\" (seirei shitei toshi) after Hiroshima, which allowed foreigners to participate in municipal referendums.In the 105-member prefectural parliament of Kanagawa, the districts of Kawasaki used as constituencies together choose 18 deputies.For the House of Representatives (Japan), Kawasaki comprises the constituencies Kanagawa 9 (in the west), 10 (in the east) and 18 (in the middle). In the 2017 election, these went unchanged to Liberal Democrats Kazunori Tanaka and Daishir\u014d Yamagiwa and ex-Democrat Hirofumi Ry\u016b for the Kib\u014d no T\u014d (Party of Hope, later to the Mirai Nippon faction).\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2005 Kawasaki mayoral election\n\n\n=== List of Mayors of Kawasaki (from 1924) ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nKawasaki Stadium: Located in Kawasaki-ku.

        "wiki": "Mikasa (\u4e09\u7b20) is a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. Named after Mount Mikasa in Nara, Japan, the ship served as the flagship of Vice Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. Days after the end of the war, Mikasa's magazine accidentally exploded and sank the ship. She was salvaged and her repairs took over two years to complete. Afterwards, the ship served as a coast-defence ship during World War I and supported Japanese forces during the Siberian Intervention in the Russian Civil War.\nAfter 1922, Mikasa was decommissioned in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty and preserved as a museum ship at Yokosuka. She was badly neglected during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s. She has been partially restored, and is now a museum ship located at Mikasa Park in Yokosuka. Mikasa is the last remaining example of a pre-dreadnought battleship anywhere in the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nCombat experience in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the \u00a330,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.As with the earlier Fuji and Shikishima-class battleships, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. Mikasa, the last of these ships, was ordered from the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in 1898 at the cost of \u00a3880,000 (8.8 million yen at that time). Although she closely resembled several of the other ships ordered in this program, she was the only ship in her class.\n\n\n== Design and description ==\n\nThe design of Mikasa was a modified version of the Formidable-class battleships of the Royal Navy with two additional 6-inch (152 mm) guns. Mikasa had an overall length of 432 feet (131.7 m), a beam of 76 feet (23.2 m), and a normal draught of 27 feet 2 inches (8.3 m). She displaced 15,140 long tons (15,380 t) at normal load. The crew numbered about 830 officers and enlisted men.The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at 15,000 indicated horsepower (11,000 kW), using forced draught, and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) although Mikasa proved to be faster during her sea trials in December 1901, reaching 18.45 knots (34.17 km/h; 21.23 mph) from 16,341 indicated horsepower (12,185 kW). She carried a maximum of 2,000 tonnes (2,000 long tons) of coal which allowed her to steam for 9,000 nautical miles (17,000 km; 10,000 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).Mikasa's main battery consisted of the same four Elswick Ordnance Company 40-calibre twelve-inch guns used in all of the preceding Japanese battleships. They were mounted in twin-gun barbettes fore and aft of the superstructure that had armoured hoods to protect the guns and were usually called gun turrets. The hydraulically powered mountings could be loaded at all angles of traverse while the guns were loaded at a fixed angle of +13.5\u00b0. They fired 850-pound (386 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,400 ft/s (730 m/s).The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 40-calibre 6-inch (152 mm) quick-firing guns mounted in casemates. Ten of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other four guns were placed above them at the corners of the superstructure. They fired 100-pound (45 kg) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 ft/s (700 m/s). Protection against torpedo boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. The 12-pounders fired 3-inch (76 mm), 12.5-pound (5.7 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,359 ft/s (719 m/s). Lighter guns consisted of eight 47-millimetre (1.9 in) three-pounder Hotchkiss guns and eight 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The three-pounder gun fired 3.19-pound (1.45 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 1,927 ft/s (587 m/s) while the 2.5-pounder fired 2.5-pound (1.1 kg) shells at a muzzle velocity of 1,420 ft/s (430 m/s). The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.The waterline armour belt of Mikasa consisted of Krupp cemented armour that had a maximum thickness of 9 inches (229 mm) over the middle of the ship. It was only 4 inches (102 mm) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch strake of armour that ran between the barbettes. The barbettes were 14 inches (356 mm) thick, but reduced to six inches at the level of the lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a thickness of 8\u201310 inches (203\u2013254 mm). The casemates protecting the secondary armament were 2\u20136 inches (51\u2013152 mm) thick and the deck armour was 2\u20133 inches (51\u201376 mm) in thickness. The forward conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour, but the aft conning tower only had four inches of armour.Mikasa, like all the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four Barr & Stroud FA3 coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of 7,300 metres (8,000 yd). In addition the ships were also fitted with 24-power magnification telescopic gunsights.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\n\nMikasa, named after Mount Mikasa, was laid down by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 24 January 1899. She was launched on 8 November 1900 and completed on 1 March 1902. After a visit to Devonport, she left Plymouth on 13 March, bound for Yokohama, under the command of Captain Hayasaki.At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Mikasa, commanded by Captain Hikojir\u014d Ijichi, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T\u014dg\u014d had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser Boyarin which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. T\u014dg\u014d chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese 8-inch (203 mm) and six-inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before T\u014dg\u014d disengaged. Mikasa was hit by two ten-inch shells during the engagement that wounded seven crewmen.The ship participated in the action of 13 April when T\u014dg\u014d successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship Petropavlovsk. When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T\u014dg\u014d resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields which sank two Japanese battleships the following month.During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, Mikasa was at the head of the column of Japanese battleships and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was hit twenty times, two of which knocked out her aft 12-inch gun turret, and suffered 125 casualties among her crew. In turn, she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships Poltava and Tsesarevich although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact.\n\n\n=== Battle of Tsushima ===\n\nAt the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, Mikasa again led the 1st Fleet into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons detached from the Baltic Fleet. The ship opened fire at the battleship Knyaz Suvorov, the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by the battleship Asahi and the armoured cruiser Azuma shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear twelve-inch gun turret, and jammed Knyaz Suvorov's steering so that she fell out of formation. During this time, Mikasa was the focus of the Russian fire as the leading ship in the Japanese column and was hit by 6 twelve-inch and 19 six-inch shells. They did very little damage and T\u014dg\u014d was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. Knyaz Suvorov's steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and Mikasa fired three torpedoes at her to no avail. Later in the battle, the ship appears to have fired mostly on the battleship Borodino although Fuji fired the shots that caused the Russian ship's magazines to explode and sink her. At 18:04, a twelve-inch shell detonated prematurely in the barrel of the right gun of the forward turret, disabling the gun and knocking out the left gun until 18:40. Another twelve-inch shell had exploded in that same barrel almost two hours earlier, but had not damaged the gun. One six-inch gun jammed after firing 19 rounds, but the only other damage to any of the ship's guns was one six-inch gun that was disabled by a Russian shell of the same size that entered through the gunport. She fired 124 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship except Asahi's 142. In total, Mikasa was hit more than 40 times during the battle, including 10 twelve-inch and 22 six-inch shells, but none of them seriously damaged her. While Mikasa's casualties are not precisely known, the entire Japanese force combined only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle.\n\nSix days after the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war was signed, Mikasa sank at her moorings after a fire and magazine explosion at Sasebo on the night of 11/12 September 1905 that killed 251 crewmen. She was refloated on 7 August 1906, reconstructed and repaired at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her existing armament with more powerful 45-calibre twelve-inch and six-inch guns during the two years it took to repair the ship. Mikasa was restored to active service on 24 August 1908. During World War I, she served on coast-defence duties, based at Maizuru, during 1914\u201315 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, for the rest of the war. The ship supported the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War during 1921 and was reclassified on 1 September 1921 as a first-class coast-defence ship. On 17 September, Mikasa ran aground near Askold Island off Vladivostok, but was not seriously damaged.\n\n\n=== Preservation ===\n\nThe ship was decommissioned on 23 September 1923 following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and scheduled for destruction. However, at the request of the Japanese government, each of the signatory countries to the treaty agreed that Mikasa could be preserved as a memorial ship with her hull encased in concrete. On 12 November 1926, Mikasa was opened for display in Yokosuka in the presence of Crown Prince Hirohito and T\u014dg\u014d. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the ship deteriorated under control of the occupation forces. In 1955, Philadelphia businessman John Rubin, formerly of Barrow, England, wrote a letter to the Japan Times about the state of the ship, which was the catalyst for a new restoration campaign. With the support of the Japanese public, and also Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the restored battleship reopened in 1961. On 5 August 2009, Mikasa was repainted by sailors from USS Nimitz.Mikasa is remembered in Barrow-in-Furness, the town of its construction, by Mikasa Street on Walney Island.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRussian cruiser Aurora, a surviving Russian warship of the Battle of Tsushima\nUSS Olympia, a U.S. Navy protected cruiser preserved in Philadelphia\nUSS Texas, sole surviving dreadnought battleship\nGreek cruiser Georgios Averof, the only armored cruiser still afloat\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrook, Peter (1999).

        "wiki": "Chinese people in Japan include any people self-identifying as ethnic Chinese or people possessing Chinese citizenship living in Japan. People aged 22 or older cannot possess dual-citizenship in Japan, so Chinese possessing Japanese citizenship typically no longer possess Chinese citizenship. The term \"Chinese people\" typically refers to the Han Chinese, the main ethnic group living in China (PRC) (including Hong Kong and Macau SARs), Taiwan (ROC) and Singapore. Officially, China (PRC) is home to 55 additional ethnic minorities, including people such as Tibetans, though these people might not self-identify as Chinese. Han Chinese people have had a long history in Japan as a minority.\n\n\n== Population and distribution ==\nMost Chinese people, or descendants of Chinese immigrants, who are living in Japan reside in major cities such as Osaka, Yokohama, and Tokyo, although there are increasingly also significant populations in other areas as government immigration policies increasingly attract workers to 'training programs', universities seek increasing numbers of international students and Chinese people see business opportunities. Japan's first recognised Chinatown was in Nagasaki, developing in the 1680s when economic prerogatives meant that the Shogunal government needed to restrict and control trade to a greater extent than previously. Before this, there had been a large number of Chinese communities in the west of the country, made up of pirates, merchants and also people who fitted into both categories. In the 19th century, the well-known Chinatowns of Yokohama and Kobe developed, and they are still thriving today, although the majority of Chinese people in Japan live outside Chinatowns in the regular community. The communities are served by Chinese schools that teach the Chinese language, and a small but increasing number of Japanese people study Chinese in both public schools and private academies.\nThe Chinese community has undergone a dramatic change since the PRC allowed more freedom of movement of its citizens, but citizens of Taiwan (ROC), Singapore and Hong Kong nationality are not counted in these figures. A study that was conducted in 1995 estimated that the Chinese population of Japan numbered 150,000, among whom between 50,000 and 100,000 could speak Chinese. In 2000, Japanese governmental statistics revealed that there were 335,575 Chinese people in Japan. Current demographic statistics reveal that these numbers have reached over 600,000 legal immigrants, although there is probably also a significant population, although of unknown number, of undocumented immigrants. A significant number of Chinese people take Japanese citizenship each year and therefore disappear from these figures. As Japanese citizenship, like France, does not record ethnicity, once a person has naturalised, they are simply Japanese, so the category of Chinese-Japanese does not exist in the same way as it would in a country which recognises ethnicity. Therefore, the numbers of Japanese people who are of Chinese descent is unclear.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-modern era ===\nIt is believed that a substantial component of the Yayoi people migrated from China to Japan. The Yayoi people who introduced wet rice cultivation to Japan may have come from Jiangnan near the Yangtze River Delta in ancient China. This is supported by archeological research and bones found in modern southeastern China and western Japan. According to several Japanese historians, the Yayoi and their ancestors, the Wajin, originated in the today Yunnan province in southern China. Suwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku (Wajin) to be part of the Baiyue (\u767e\u8d8a). It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (today ~36%), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3) (today ~23%) and Haplogroup O-M119 (O1) (today ~4%), which are typical for East- and Southeast-Asians. Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, and O1 are one of the carriers of Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined, several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. It is suggested that the linguistic homeland of Japonic is located somewhere in south-eastern or eastern China before the proto-Japanese migrated to the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. According to linguist, Alexander Vovin, the urheimat of the Japonic languages may have been located in Southern China. Japanese linguist, Miyamoto Kazuo, instead has suggested a homeland further north in China, around modern day Beijing and Liaoning.Ambassadorial visits to Japan by the later Chinese dynasties Wei and Jin recorded that the Wajin of Japan claimed to be descendants of Taibo of Wu, traditionally believed to be the founder of Wu. Several scholars in Japan suggested that the Yamato people and the Imperial House of Japan are descendants of the Wu and possibly Taibo. Many Japanese historians also link the early Japanese Yayoi people to the Baiyue tribes that also include the Wu people.A Chinese legend of uncertain provenance states that Xu Fu, a Qin Dynasty court sorcerer, was sent by Qin Shi Huang to Penglai Mountain (Mount Fuji) in 219 BC to retrieve an elixir of life. Xu could not find any elixir of life and was reluctant to return to China because he knew he would be sentenced to death, Xu instead stayed in Japan. Other immigrants are also thought to include major population movements such as that of the Hata clan. The Hata clan claimed to be the descendants of Qin Shi Huang.\nIn 499 CE, a Chinese Buddhist missionary Hui Shen, paid visit to an island east of China known as Fusang, typically identified with modern-day Japan, which was described in the 7th-century Liang Shu.\nAccording to the Shinsen Sh\u014djiroku (815), 176 Chinese aristocratic families lived in the Kinai area of Honshu, around the modern-day Kansai region. These immigrant clans were referred to as Toraijin (\u6e21\u6765\u4eba).During the Mongol invasions of China, many Chinese refugees fled to Japan. Some of these Chinese refugees became immensely powerful, for example, Mugaku Sogen, a Chinese Zen Buddhist who fled to Japan after the fall of the Song dynasty. After fleeing Japan, Mugaku Sogen became an advisor to the then ruler of Japan, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune.  The Chinese refugees who fled the Mongols warned the Japanese that the Mongols would also intend to invade Japan. Mugaku Sogen gave a bad report to Tokimune about the barbarity and cruelty of the Mongols after witnessing Mongol soldiers killing his fellow monks at a monastery. This encouraged Tokimune to not pay tribute to the Mongols as the emissaries Kublai Khan sent to Japan demanded, and instead resist the Mongols in their later attempted invasions of Japan. During the second Mongol invasion of Japan, many Chinese soldiers landed in Japan. After the Mongol defeat, the Japanese defenders killed all the Koreans, Mongols, and Jurchen soldiers they found, except for the Southern Chinese, who the Japanese felt had been coerced by the Mongols into joining the attack on Japan.  The Southern Chinese soldiers were spared from being killed by the Japanese, but instead forced to become slaves. During the Ming dynasty, Japan became decentralized without a central government and with many local daimyo reigning the country, in what would be called the Sengoku Period. Many of these daimyo encouraged Chinese immigration to Japan due to their skills and boost to the local economy. Many Chinese communities would be established in Japan, especially on the island of Kyushu. Many Chinese pirates would set up their bases in Japan in order to launch raid and attacks on mainland China as part of the wokou. For example, the powerful Chinese pirate, Wang Zhi, who became known as the \"king of the wokou\", established his base of operation in Japanese islands, in order to launch raids against the Ming government. Many of the Chinese pirates were supported by Japanese daimyo themselves.Chinese people are also known to have settled in Okinawa during the Sanzan period at the invitation of the Ryukyuan kings; these were high level royal advisors who lived in the village of Kumemura, for example, claim to all be descended from Chinese immigrants.During the Manchu conquest of China, many Chinese refugees would again flee to Japan to escape Manchu rule. For example, the Chinese scholar, Zhu Zhiyu, was one of the greatest scholars of Confucianism in the Ming dynasty and Edo Japan. Zhu remains the best remembered of the Ming political refugees in Tokugawa Japan and the one who contributed most to Japanese education and intellectual history.One of the most well-known Chinese folk heroes was the Ming loyalist Koxinga, who conquered the island of Taiwan from the hands of the Dutch, in order to establish the Tungning Kingdom, the last remnant of the fallen Ming dynasty, where he could continue to fight against the Manchu invaders of China. Despite being a Chinese folk hero, Koxinga was actually born in Japan, to a Chinese merchant father and a Japanese mother. Koxinga is still worshiped as a folk deity, especially in Fujian and Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nDuring the Meiji and Taisho eras, it is estimated that up to 100 000 Chinese students came to study in Japan. Japan was both closer to China culturally and in distance than the American and European alternatives. It was also much cheaper. In 1906 alone, more than six thousand Chinese students were in Japan. Most of them resided in the district of Kanda in Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\nThe term shin-kaky\u014d refers to people of Chinese descent who immigrated to Japan from Taiwan and mainland China.\n\n\n== Groups ==\n\n\n=== Foreign students ===\n\nMany famous Chinese intellectuals and political figures have studied in Japan, among them Sun Yat-sen, Zhou Zuoren, Lu Xun, Zhou Enlai and Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n=== Workers ===\nThe industrial 'training scheme' used to bring Chinese workers to Japan has been criticized by lawyers as exploitation, after several deaths.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nMany Japanese war orphans left behind in China after World War II have migrated to Japan with the assistance of the Japanese government, bringing along their Chinese spouses and children.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nChinese restaurants in Japan serve a fairly distinct style of Chinese cuisine. Though in the past Chinese cuisine would have been primarily available in Chinatowns such as those in port cities of Kobe, Nagasaki, or Yokohama, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is now commonly available all over Japan. As Japanese restaurants often specialise in just one sort of dish, cuisine is focused primarily on dishes found within three distinct types of restaurants: ramen restaurants, dim sum houses, and standard Chinese-style restaurants.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2008 there are five Chinese day schools in Japan: two in Yokohama and one each in Kobe, Osaka, and Tokyo. Three are oriented towards the Republic of China on Taiwan while two are oriented towards mainland China. In Japanese the PRC-oriented schools are called tairiku-kei, and the ROC-oriented schools are taiwan-kei. The ROC-oriented schools teach Traditional Chinese and Bopomofo while the mainland-oriented schools teach Simplified Chinese and Hanyu Pinyin. The ROC-oriented schools, by 2008, also began teaching Simplified Chinese.As of 1995 most teachers at these schools are ethnic Chinese persons who were born in Japan. By that year there were increasing numbers of Japanese families sending their children to Chinese schools. Other students at Chinese schools are Japanese with mixed Chinese-Japanese parentage, Japanese children with Chinese parents, and returnees from abroad.\n\nSun Yat-sen established the Yokohama Chinese School in 1898. In 1952 it split into the mainland-aligned Yokohama Yamate Chinese School and the ROC-aligned Yokohama Overseas Chinese School. The Kobe Chinese School is also oriented towards mainland China. The Osaka Chinese School is located in Naniwa-ku, Osaka. There is also the Tokyo Chinese School.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Ch\u016bnichi Shinpo, a biweekly paper, is published in Chinese and Japanese. The Ch\u016bbun and Zhongwen Dabao, both weekly newspapers, and about 28 other Chinese newspapers are published in Tokyo. In addition the Kansai Kabun Jih\u014d, published in Chinese and Japanese, is based in the Osaka area.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Ethnic relations ===\nDuring his time in office, former Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara publicly used controversial terms such as sangokujin to refer to Taiwanese Benshengren staying illegally in Japan, and implied that they might engage in rioting and looting in the aftermath of a disaster.\nI referred to the \"many sangokujin who entered Japan illegally.\" I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used gaikokujin, or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.\n... After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.\n\n... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nThis is a list of Chinese expatriates in Japan and Japanese citizens of Chinese descent.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nChen Kenmin, chef regarded as the \"father of Sichuan cuisine\" in Japan and father of Chen Kenichi\nGo Seigen, professional Go player\nSun Yat-sen, politician\nLu Xun, writer\nQiu Jin, feminist\nShosei Go, professional baseball player\nChiang Kai-shek, politician and general\nSong Jiaoren, revolutionary and political figure, founder of Tongmenghui\nJiang Baili, general\nGuo Moruo, poet and political figure\nHe Yingqin, general\nWang Jingwei, revolutionary and political figure\nDai Jitao, political figure\nChen Duxiu, co-founder of Chinese Communist Party\nLi Dazhao, co-founder of Chinese Communist Party\nZhou Zuoren, writer\nHuang Fu, general and politician\nChen Qimei, revolutionary\nZhou Enlai, politician\n\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\nMomofuku Ando, founder of Nissin Foods, with Japanese Formosa origins and ROC citizenship.\nChen Kenmin, Sichuan-born Sichuan-style chef in Japan\nChen Kenichi, son of Chen Kenmin, also a Sichuan-style chef and longest-serving participant on Japanese cooking show Iron Chef\nChire Koyama, table tennis player, formerly known as He Zhili\nAgnes Chan, pop singer, professor, and writer\nLou Zhenggang, artist\nLee Teng-hui, politician\nRissei \u014c, professional Go player\nO Meien, professional Go player\nSadaharu Oh, professional baseball player\nRin Kaiho, professional Go player\nCho U, professional Go player\nChin Shunshin, novelist\nJudy Ongg, actress, singer, author, and woodblock-print artist\nTeresa Teng, Taiwanese (ROC) pop singer\nYinling, swimsuit model, race queen, singer and former professional wrestler\nKimiko Yo, award-winning Japanese actress of Republic of China nationality\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nMo Bangfu, author\nEmi Suzuki, female model (immigrant)\nKaito Nakahori, composer (1/2 Chinese, 1/2 Japanese)\nWei Son, female model (immigrant)\nLeena, female model (immigrant)\nQian Lin & Li Chun, singers\nRola Chen, gravure idol\nZheng Yongshan, murderer\nJian Kabe, con artist\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment in China\nAnti-Chinese sentiment in Japan\nChinatown\nChinatowns in Asia\nYokohama Chinatown\nKobe Chinatown\nNagasaki Chinatown\nIkebukuro Chinatown\nKoreans in Japan\nKumemura\nJapanese orphans in China\nJapanese people in China\nAinu people\nRyukyuans\nYamato people\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJansen, Marius B.

        "wiki": "Kawasaki (\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02, Kawasaki-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the 8th most populated city in Japan (including the Tokyo Metropolitan Area) and one of the main cities forming the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihin Industrial Area.As of October 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 1,503,690, with 716,470 households, and a population density of 10,000 persons per km2. Kawasaki is the only city in Japan with more than one million inhabitants that is not a prefectural capital. The total area is 142.70 km2 (55.10 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and Ancient era ===\nArchaeological evidence from the Japanese Paleolithic and J\u014dmon period can only be found in the northwest Tama Hills. The course of the Tama and the coast of the Bay of Tokyo have also changed in historical times, so that large parts of the urban area are geologically young.\n\n\n=== Classical era ===\n\n\n==== Nara period to the Sengoku period ====\nWith the introduction of the Ritsury\u014d legal system, the area came to the Musashi Province in the 7th century. In the Nara period, the center of the Tachibana district was probably in the area of today's Takatsu district. Since the Heian period, the domain of the Inage clan has expanded here. Around the Heiken-ji Buddhist temple (better known as Kawasaki-Daishi), founded in 1128, a monzen-machi, a busy district for the supply of pilgrims, soon emerged. Between the Kamakura period and Sengoku period, smaller feudal lords ruled the area until it finally came under the control of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan.\n\n\n=== Early Modern ===\nIn 1611, Koizumi Jiday\u016b had Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui built, a canal system on the right bank of the Tama for irrigating the fields, which in some cases still runs through the densely built-up city. On the long-distance Kaid\u014d roads T\u014dkaid\u014d and Nakaharakaid\u014d built by Edo-Bakufu, stations were built in the area of what would later become Kawasaki, which increased its importance. The Kawasaki station (Kawasaki-juku, near today's Kawasaki station) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d was not officially recognized until 1623 as the last of the 53 T\u014dkaid\u014d stations. The Bakufu let the bridges over the Tama collapse and there were ferry connections to nearby Edo in several places in today's Kawasaki, which laid the foundation for the development of the city.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nThe rapid urbanization of the area, which continues to this day, began in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras. In 1872, Kawasaki Station was established on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line which was Japan's first railway line. In 1889, the city (machi) Kawasaki in the district (gun) Tachibana was created according to the Japanese municipal system introduced the year before. In 1912 the border between Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures was established in the Tama. On July 1, 1924, the independent city (shi-) of Kawasaki with 48,394 inhabitants was formed through a merger with the city of Daishi (formerly Daishigawara) and the village of Miyuki.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAs part of World War II, the city was bombed three times by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between April 1945 and July 1945. The most serious attack was an area bombing with Napalm bombs on April 15, 1945. The attacks destroyed around 35% of the urban area and claimed 1,520 dead and 8,759 injured. The attacks burned down 9.3 km\u00b2 of the city (see Bombing of Tokyo).\n\n\n=== Contemporary period ===\n\n\n==== Sh\u014dwa era (1945\u20131989) ====\nOn April 15, 1945, large parts of the area around the train station and the industrial area at the port were destroyed by air raids. Since the 1950s, residential areas for commuters have been created in the northeastern part of the city, which are connected directly to the centers of Tokyo by new railway lines. On April 1, 1972, Kawasaki became a decree-designated city (seirei shitei toshi) with 5 districts. 1973 the population exceeded the million mark. In 1982 the new districts of Miyamae and Asao were created by splitting off from the districts of Takatsu and Tama. In the course of deindustrialization, industrial areas have recently been increasingly converted into residential areas (mostly Multi-family residential), so that a further increase in population density can be expected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nKawasaki is located on the right bank of the Tama River, which flows into the Tokyo Bay here. The city lies like a narrow band between Tokyo in the northeast and Yokohama in the southwest. The city connects the two major cities and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world.\nThe eastern area along the coast of Tokyo Bay is a densely populated industrial zone, part of the Keihin Industrial Zone. In contrast, the western districts in the Tama Hills consist largely of residential areas for commuters in the Tokyo / Yokohama region.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKawasaki has seven wards (ku):\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and towns ===\nIn the northeast, Kawasaki borders the Special wards of Tokyo (starting at Tokyo Bay) \u014cta and Setagaya, in the northwest the cities (-shi) belonging to Tokyo Prefecture (-shi) Komae, Chofu, Machida, Inagi, Tama enclose the place. The opposite southwest side is entirely occupied by the districts of Tsurumi, K\u014dhoku, Tsuzuki and Aoba in the city of Yokohama. With the completion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, the city of Kisarazu, located on the opposite side of the Tokyo Bay in Chiba Prefecture, also became a neighbor in December 1997.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nTwo rivers cross the urban area. The Tama unites with the tributaries Misawa, Yamashita, Gotanda, Nikary\u014d main river and Hirase; Katahira, Asao, Shimpukuji, Arima, E, Shibu and Yabumi flow into the Tsurumi.\nThe land on the coast of the city is crossed by a network of canals (Tama Canal, Suehiro Canal, Chidori Canal, Yak\u014d Canal, Daishi Canal, Mizue Canal, Shiohama Canal, Iriesaki Canal, Asano Canal, Ikegami Canal, Minami-Watarida Canal, Tanabe Canal, Shiraishi Canal and the Sakai Canal). In addition, the historic Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui canal still exists in the hinterland.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\nKawasaki is governed by Mayor Norihiko Fukuda, an independent elected on 27 October 2013. The city assembly has 63 elected members. Mayor Fukuda was re-elected to a second term in office on 22 October 2017 with support from LDP and K\u014dmeit\u014d against former municipal MP Akiko Yoshizawa and KPJ-supported former primary school teacher Hirokazu Ichiko.The 60-member city parliament of Kawasaki was re-elected in the unified elections in April 2019. The LDP remained the strongest with 19 seats.Kawasaki was in June 2008 the second Japanese \"government-designated city\" (seirei shitei toshi) after Hiroshima, which allowed foreigners to participate in municipal referendums.In the 105-member prefectural parliament of Kanagawa, the districts of Kawasaki used as constituencies together choose 18 deputies.For the House of Representatives (Japan), Kawasaki comprises the constituencies Kanagawa 9 (in the west), 10 (in the east) and 18 (in the middle). In the 2017 election, these went unchanged to Liberal Democrats Kazunori Tanaka and Daishir\u014d Yamagiwa and ex-Democrat Hirofumi Ry\u016b for the Kib\u014d no T\u014d (Party of Hope, later to the Mirai Nippon faction).\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2005 Kawasaki mayoral election\n\n\n=== List of Mayors of Kawasaki (from 1924) ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nKawasaki Stadium: Located in Kawasaki-ku.

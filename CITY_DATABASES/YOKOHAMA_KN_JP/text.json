A Scotsman, Marshall Martin, advisor to Mayor Ariyoshi Chuichi, is credited with persuading the city government to use rubble from the Kannai commercial district to reclaim the former waterfront as a park.Yamashita Park was formally opened on March 15, 1930.\nThe park was requisitioned in 1945 during the Occupation of Japan for military housing, reverting to Japanese control in 1960.  Across the street from the park is the Hotel New Grand where General Douglas MacArthur spent his first night on his arrival in Japan on August 30, 1945.\n\n\n== Park attractions ==\nAs well as public green space with trees, flower beds, fountains and memorials, Yamashita Park is also noted as the location of:\n\nThe Hikawa Maru, a Japanese ocean liner built in 1929 for Nippon Y\u016bsen Kabushiki Kaisha (\"NYK Line\") now a museum ship.\nThe Port Service, an operator of seabuses, excursion and restaurant ships, operating from the park pier. Ship services include scheduled public lines as far as Yokohama Station as well as larger charter ships.\nThe Guardian of Water, a Donal Hord sculpture gifted by Yokohama's sister city San Diego in 1960. A replica of the sculpture located in front of the San Diego County Administration Center.\nYokohama Indian Water Fountain. Donated by the local Indian community to show its gratitude to the Japanese for aiding the Indian survivors after the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, as well as to remember those who perished in the disaster.\nGirl Scout Statue - Dedicated March 18, 1962 on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts. (two of the three models for the statue are Libby Watson and Hiroko Tanaka)\nStatue of the Girl with Red Shoes (Akai Kutsu)\nMonument of the Children's Song \"Seagull Sailor Man\"\nMonument of General Artemio Ricarte - Philippine General, erected in 1972\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Sankei-en (\u4e09\u6eaa\u5712, Three Creeks Garden) is a traditional Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan, which opened in 1906. Sankei-en was designed and built by Tomitaro Hara (\u539f\u5bcc\u592a\u90ce) (1868\u20131939), known by the pseudonym Sankei Hara, who was a silk trader. Almost all of its buildings are historically significant structures bought by Hara himself in locations all over the country, among them Tokyo, Kyoto, Kamakura, Gifu Prefecture, and Wakayama prefecture. Ten have been declared Important Cultural Property, and three more are Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan designated by the City of Yokohama. Badly damaged during World War II, the garden was donated in 1953 to the City of Yokohama, which entrusted it to the Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai Foundation (\u4e09\u6eaa\u5712\u4fdd\u52dd\u4f1a, Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai). Sankei-en was then restored almost to its pre-war condition.\n\n\n== Features ==\nSankei-en has a total surface of 175 thousand square meters and features ponds, streams, and undulating paths designed by Sankei Hara himself, plus many historic buildings, such as T\u014dmy\u014d-ji former three-story pagoda (\u65e7\u71c8\u660e\u5bfa\u4e09\u91cd\u5854), originally constructed in Kyoto in 1457 and relocated in 1914, and the Former Yanohara House (\u65e7\u77e2\u7b86\u539f\u5bb6\u4f4f\u5b85), originally the private residence of the Yanohara family.Work on the garden started in 1902 and ended in 1908, two years after it was opened to the public. During Hara's own lifetime, the place became an aggregation point for Meiji period artists. World War II caused great damage to the buildings. In 1953 the garden was donated by the Hara family to the City of Yokohama, which created the Sankeien Hosh\u014dkai Foundation for its repair and maintenance. The Foundation started the restoration in 1953 and, five years later, the garden was back almost to its original form and reopened to the public.The Japanese government has designated ten structures in Sankei-en as Important Cultural Properties, while three more are Tangible Cultural Properties designated by the City of Yokohama. The garden is popular for its cherry blossoms, ume blossoms, and the changing leaves in autumn.\n\n\n=== Kakush\u014dkaku ===\nNext to the entrance, the Kakush\u014dkaku (\u9db4\u7fd4\u95a3) was formerly the private residence of the Hara family. Today it can be rented by the public and used for meetings and parties. It is one of the three buildings on the premises designated as Tangible Cultural Properties by the City of Yokohama. Only during the summer, the Kakush\u014dkaku is open to the public.\n\n\n=== Sankei Memorial ===\nLocated immediately after the Kakush\u014dkaku, the Sankei Memorial (\u4e09\u6eaa\u8a18\u5ff5\u9928, Sankei Kinenkan) was built to introduce the public to the garden and its creator through exhibits, images and works of art. A Gifu Prefecture native, Hara was the eldest son of Yanaizuch\u014d village's headman. From childhood he liked and studied the fine arts, Sinology and poetry, finally beginning formal studies in 1885 in what is now Tokyo's Waseda University. After graduation, he became a teacher at the Atomi School for Girls. Born Aoki, he changed it later after marrying one of his students and being adopted by her family. He became the head of the family trading business and was very successful. After moving to Sankei-en's present location in Honmoku, he started collecting old buildings, rebuilding them in his garden. He then decided to open the garden to the public for free in 1906.\n\n\n=== Outer Garden ===\nThe Outer Garden, that is, the area next to the Main Pond, was the first part of the garden to open to the public in 1906. The buildings it contains are T\u014dmy\u014d-ji former three-storied pagoda, a tea room called Rind\u014d-an (\u6797\u6d1e\u5eb5), a tea hut called Yokobue-an (\u6a2a\u7b1b\u5eb5), T\u014dkei-ji's former butsuden (\u65e7\u6771\u6176\u5bfa\u4ecf\u6bbf, Ky\u016b-T\u014dkei-ji butsuden) and T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former hon-d\u014d (Main Hall) (\u65e7\u71c8\u660e\u5bfa\u672c\u5802, Ky\u016b-T\u014dmy\u014d-ji hon-d\u014d).T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former main hall (Important National Cultural Property) was brought here from Kyoto and is an example of Muromachi period (1336\u20131557) architecture. Bought in 1988, it was completely restored with intensive work of restoration and reconstruction that lasted five years.T\u014dmy\u014d-ji's former three-storied pagoda (Important National Cultural Property) is visible from any point of the garden and is its symbol. It was moved to Sankei-en in 1914.\nT\u014dkei-ji's former butsuden (Important National Cultural Property) used to be the main hall of a Rinzai Zen temple in Kamakura. Its structure and name are typical of that sect. It was bought and moved to Sankei-en in 1907.\n\n\n==== Former Yanohara House ====\nThe Former Yanohara House (\u65e7\u77e2\u7b86\u539f\u5bb6\u4f4f\u5b85, Ky\u016b-Yanohara-ke Sh\u016btaku) (Important National Cultural Property) used to be the private home of an Edo period (1603\u20131868) wealthy family, the Yanohara. It is the only building whose interior is open to the public all year. It was brought here from Gifu Prefecture's Shirakawago, an area listed among the World Heritage sites. The house contains the original hearth, bathroom and kitchen used by the Yanohara. The second floor houses an exhibition of Japanese folk articles.\n\n\n=== Inner Garden ===\nThe Inner Garden, north of the Main Pond, was opened to the public in 1958, and was until then the Hara family's private garden. Its buildings are the Gomon Gate (\u5fa1\u9580) (Tangible Cultural Property), the Hakuun-tei (\u767d\u96f2\u90b8) (Tangible Cultural Property), the Rinshunkaku (\u81e8\u6625\u95a3), Tenzui-ji's former Jut\u014d \u014cid\u014d (\u65e7\u5929\u745e\u5bfa\u5bff\u5854\u8986\u5802, Ky\u016b-Tenzui-ji Jut\u014d \u014cid\u014d), the Shuns\u014dro (\u6625\u8349\u5eec), the Kinmokutsu (\u91d1\u6bdb\u7a9f), the Gekkaden (\u6708\u83ef\u6bbf), the Tenju-in (\u5929\u6388\u9662), the Ch\u014dsh\u016bkaku (\u8074\u79cb\u95a3), and the Renge-in. Only during the summer, the Rinshunkaku and the Hakuun-tei are open to the public.Of particular value is the Rinshunkaku (Important National Cultural Property, see photo below), formerly belonging to the Kii House of Tokugawa. It is often compared in beauty to the World famous Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. Originally the summer residence of Tokugawa Yorinobu, the first head of the Kii House, it used to stand in Iwade, Wakayama prefecture. Acquired by Hara in 1906, it was rebuilt over a period of three years between 1915 and 1917. Divided in three sections, it was decorated by famous artists Kan\u014d Tany\u016b and Kan\u014d Yasunobu. The transoms between pavilions are decorated with sculpted waves (first pavilion) and special paper containing poetry (second pavilion). The third pavilion's transom is decorated with real gagaku instruments like sh\u014d and flutes.\nThe Gekkaden (Important National Cultural Property) was built in 1603 by Ieyasu, the first of the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns within Kyoto's Fushimi Castle. It was bought in 1918 together with the Shuns\u014dro and moved to Sankei-en. Hara then connected it to a pavilion he built, the Kinmokutsu. The paintings on the room partitions are attributed to Momoyama period artist Kaih\u014d Y\u016bsh\u014d. The Gekkaden can be rented by the public.\nThe Tenju-in (Important National Cultural Property) was originally a Jiz\u014d-d\u014d in Kita-Kamakura near the great Kench\u014d-ji Zen temple and was bought in 1916. Tenju-in was Hara's Jibutsu-d\u014d (\u6301\u4ecf\u5802), the temple which enshrined his tutelary gods.Tenzui-ji's former Jut\u014d \u014ci-d\u014d (Important National Cultural Property, see image above) was built in 1591 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi as a resting place for his mother, and is one of the few extant buildings attributable with certainty to him.The construction of the Ch\u014dsh\u016bkaku (Important National Cultural Property, see photo below) is traditionally attributed to Iemitsu, third of the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns. The pavilion is open to the public in spring and in November for the traditional viewing of the autumn colors.The Shuns\u014dro (Important National Cultural Property) is a tea room believed to have been built for Oda Urakusai, brother of the more famous Oda Nobunaga. Urakusai was a well-known practitioner of the tea ceremony.\n\n\n== Getting there ==\nFrom Yokohama, take the Negishi Line to Negishi.\nFrom bus stop No. 1, take any of the buses numbered 58, 99 or 101 and get off in Honmoku.\nCross the street, walk to the convenience store, turn right and walk straight to the garden (about 500 meters)\n\n\n== Other information ==\nOpening hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (entrance allowed until 16:30)\nTicket price (as of December 2017): 700 Yen\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u014czone Oshitayashiki\nKatsura Imperial Villa\nMa (negative space)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto gallery\nPamphlet in English (pdf)\n(in Japanese) Official website\nRemembering Tomitaro Hara by Satyasri Ukil\nMukul Dey's Letter from Sankeien, Yokohama\nSankeien and its Architectural Treasures",

          "We took our kids to the Cupnoodle museum with a local friend that had recommended it. We weren't sure what to expect but we all definitely had a fun time albeit short. There isn't much to do without extra costs but we did make our own noodle cups. Our kids had a blast doing",

          "We took a pleasant 15-minute walk from \u014csanbashi Pier one sunny morning. While it was midweek, the waterfront was fairly lively. So was the museum - a distinctly simple building with an understated entrance. The main lobby is anchored by a grandly magnificent minimalist",

          "Great family fun place to visit. You make your own personal noodles in a cup from selected flavour bar. Then you get a carry case for safe transportation. It's an interesting place and history of how noodles is packaged was fascinating!!",
          "Take my son everytime he is here. Place is awesome for young children. Lots of history of Momofuku and how he built his biz empire w simple concepts. There is also a place where you can customize your own cup noodle",
          "We paid for both the Cup Noodle experience and the Chicken Ramen experience and both were fun. For the Cup Noodle experience you can color and design a cup, then select your soup and up to 4 toppings. The workers put it all together and shrink wrap it and you get a cool blow up",
          "Not bad. But little expensive. There are a lot of lot of children so noisy. In fourth stair the view was good. In museum it is not familiar to foreigner. Almost sentence is written in japanese.",
          "We were traveling with some cup noodles fanatics so this was an obvious must see for us. It was easy to get to and there were nice places to walk around and explore nearby so well worth the day trip. The building looks unassuming from the inside but it's pretty neat inside.",
          "Very interesting and perfect day trip attraction. It's a \u00a5500 entrance fee for adults and free for high school students and younger, as long as you can show some form of ID. It's an extra \u00a5300 to do the cup noodle \"making\" and another \u00a5300 to buy the cup in which it is \"made.\"",
          "I went to experience how a ramen (an instant traditional Japanese noodle ) is made. The overall experience in making your own noodle is around 45 min but it is well worthy. You need to reserve a slot well in advance since it is a very popular attraction. But the experience is",
          "I was there on weekday in June. It's not too many ppl if you plan to go there in the morning. The exhibition is great, especially the collection of worldwide instant noodle. You can also design your own cupnoodle or if you wanna make your own noodle, you can book early to do it",
          "The process is actually simple. We were expecting a more personalized experience but was let down with a colour your own cup for the noodle. The next thing that happened was that you get to choose your flavor and ingredients and they just sealed it up. Dun over expect anything",
          "Perhaps this was our fault for arriving so late or perhaps it was our mistake for planning a trip to Yokohama during Spring Break for Japanese school children. Either way, by the time we arrived at the Cup Noodle Museum, all the Make-Your-Own-Cup-Noodle tickets were sold out.",
          "Easily accessible from subway station and it is only 30 minutes from Tokyo. Very suitable for people who love cup noodles. The exhibits are limited and the shortcoming is compensated by the customised cup noodles and the noodles making workshop. We spent 2-3 hours in this place.",
          "Would this work in a western country? Probably not. I couldn't get over the cost of the infrastructure. The building is insanely big for what it houses. I'd hate to think how much the real estate is worth. I went in with an open mind and two other adults. I must admit I got into",
          "Fun to visit. The movie tells a story of how cup noodles was created. Best part is creating your own cup noodle , customizing it and taking it back with you.",
          "There were a lot of people when I visited. I enjoyed making my own noodles. I also like the short video about how the instant noodles and cup noodles were created. There were different languages available for the movie. So far all the staff were very helpful. Even thought",
          "You get to decorate your cup and decide what freeze dried ingredients to add. It is then sealed and enveloped in an air-filled bag.",

          "Visited the cup noodles museum during a day trip to Yokohama from Tokyo (just 35-45 mins by train). I would highly recommend the day trip to Yokohama - especially to the Minato Mirai 21 area. It was certainly interesting to learn about the history of cup noodles, how it",

          "Overall okay to visit if you happen to be by the neighbourhood.not worth making the way just to pay 500yen per entry to decorate your noodle cup + everything is chargeable there. Just to go into the kids park it cost another 300 yen for 30 min which i feel should be included in",
          "It was a fun family activity! We wanted to learn more about ramen and thought we would get a lot from it. We got to take home our own souvenir: a customized cup of noodle ramen! Which was something fun to do. But I wouldn't come back to the museum to make one. They charged us",

          "Ever had cup noodles? Most of us have. Well this museum, in what seems a fairly new building, tells the story of how it all started and how its popularity has grown. Theatre was well presented with audio guide. Staff very helpful. Fun designing my personalised cup noodles.",
          "Great museum that explains the story and the preparation of Cup Noodles. The best thing is the laboratory where you can personalize your cup and decide what taste of noodles you bring home. We went with our two olde son who enjoyed himself a lot! Great time in Cup Noodlea Museum!",
          "We are no fans of cup noodles, but that did not matter at all, because the Cup Noodle Museum is one of a kind. It starts with the fact, that you get to make your own cup noodles - decorating the cup, choosing the ingredients and then putting your cup into an inflatable,",
          "This visit allows a hands on experience. There is an entry fee. For an additional fee you can design your own cup, then have them fill the cup with custom selected ingredients. The cup will be vacuum sealed. You can also place the cup into a cushioned carry plastic bag to avoid",
          "We spent 2.5 hours at the museum, not that it has much to see but I spent an hour making my own cup noodle! It cost 300 yen only and you get to draw whatever you want on it and it makes a perfect personalized gift. The cup noodle is good for a month but my boyfriend couldn't",
          "A gem if a small museum and curiously uplifting and informative. It's more about the creator of cup noodle's vision and philosophy of life and actually quite inspiring. Enjoyed making my own cup noodle that cost more than the modest $4.90 entrance fee. The exhibits were fun",
          "Spend about 2 hours there. Wonderful experience to be able to let you participate in making your own cup noodle. Certainly inspiration on entrepreneurship. Overall just a must see and learn about the history of Nissin instant noodles.",
          "Poor as a museum. Since its food related, sample tasting area would have been excellent. Also sales of mini cup noodles of various kinds would be attractive. Novelty goods are pricey. Can make your own noodles but pricey as well. Avoid school holiday seasons.",
          "The cup noodles museum is a lot of fun. Try to get there early so you can custom make your own cup of noodles (tickets sell-out). If you have time to plan in advance, reserve a spot in one of the noodle making classes. My daughter was able to do that on a separate visit and",
          "I miss this cup noodles museum in Osaka, so must go when I at Tokyo. If you holding JR pass, just take a train to Sakuragicho Station by Negeshi Line, and walk about 15 mins you will see the red color building, just beside Cosmo Clock 21. This cup noodle is my favorite brand",
          "We enjoyed this more than we expected. The philosophy of innovation is emphasized and creativity is encouraged. And we ate our custom made cup of noodles at 4:30 am before leaving for our flight home. Delicious!",
          "The history presentations and displays are informative. Need to walk along in the right order to follow correctly. Was very crowded. Suggest making arrangement to reserve slots to make your own Cup Noodle or preparing noodles workshop. The food court area can be a bit",
          "We visited on a Saturday during Japanese school holiday, so the place was packed, and the noodle making I was looking forward to had a long queue even with pre-booked tickets. The museum was interesting but I was bit overwhelmed with the crowd.",
          "I didnt get to make my own cup noodle since the museum was way too crowded on the day we went. I would assume that that is the highlight of the place. Other than that, it is pretty typical museum-y where you walk around and look at the history of cup noodles and some interesting",
          "This sounds like a corny idea, but is actually was quite a rewarding visit. A number of nice exhibits but the really fun thing was to make our own cup noodles. There is a large play area for older kids too.",

          "This a great museum for both adults and kids, there are exhibits covering the history of the cupnoodle, probably better known as a Pot Noodle in the uk. The short movie is very good and English audio is available and afterwards there is a chance to design and make your own",
          "Brilliant time had by my family. We booked on the making ramen course and that was great fun. Great place for kids and adults who think they are big kids. Value for money",

          "I had a nice time visiting the Cupnoodles Museum. It was a lot more fun than Ramen Museum. A very clean and open design. It was interesting learning about Momofuku Ando, instant noodles and cup noodles. Too bad I came too late and tickets for Make your Own Cup Noodles class was",

Through trains between Shimbashi Station and K\u014dzu Station required a switchback at Yokohama Station.\nOn August 1, 1898, a line bypassing Yokohama Station was opened to avoid the switchback. Through trains stopped at Kanagawa Station or Hodogaya Station instead of Yokohama Station, and shuttle trains connected Yokohama and Hodogaya until Hiranuma Station opened near present-day Hiranumabashi Station on October 10, 1901. Hiranuma Station had no connection to public transport such as trams, so that major part of the passengers for the city continued to use trains that stopped at Yokohama Station.\n\n\n=== Second station ===\n\nOn August 15, 1915, the second Yokohama Station opened close to the present day Takashimach\u014d Station to allow T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line trains to call at Yokohama Station. The original Yokohama Station was renamed Sakuragich\u014d Station. JR East uses this date as the opening date of the current Yokohama Station.\nThe terminal of the Keihin Line (present-day Keihin-T\u014dhoku Line) had been in Takashimach\u014d since 1914 and was merged to the new station. The government-run electric line was later this year extended to Sakuragich\u014d.\nOn 1 September 1923, the station was destroyed by a fire in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake.\nSix days later, the station reopened with a temporary building.\nThe city of Yokohama and the Ministry of Railways agreed in February 1924 that the station would be relocated.On May 18, 1928, the Tokyo Yokohama Railway (now the Tokyu Toyoko Line) extended from its former terminal of Kanagawa Station was connected to the station. The extension line passed through the construction site of the new Yokohama Station of the government railways.\n\n\n=== Third station ===\n\nOn October 15, 1928, the third (current) Yokohama Station opened on the north side of the second station. The T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line also moved to its current route, which was the route of the bypass line opened in 1898. The government railways and the Toyoko Line shared the station from the beginning.\nOn February 5, 1930, the Keihin Electric Railway (now the Keikyu Main Line) was connected to the station.\nOn December 27, 1933, the Jinch\u016b Railway (now the Sotetsu Main Line) was connected to the station. On December 9, 1957, the north side underground entrance opened. On December 1, 1965, the MARS on-line ticket reservation system was introduced at the station. On September 4, 1976, the Yokohama City Subway Line No. 3 was connected to Yokohama Station. On November 7, 1980, the new east station building and east-west passage opened. On January 31, 2004, The T\u014dky\u016b T\u014dyoko Line platform reopened underground, and on February 1, 2004, the Minatomirai Line opened.\n\n\n=== Future ===\nOn August 26, 2010, JR East announced the development of a new station building to replace the current West Entrance, tentatively named the Yokohama Station West Station Building (\u6a2a\u6d5c\u99c5 \u897f\u53e3\u99c5\u30d3\u30eb, Yokohama-eki Nishiguchi-eki biru).  Scheduled to open in 2020 before the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, the development will include a 26-story retail and office building, Station-front tower (\u99c5\u524d\u68df, Ekimae-t\u014d), on the site of the current West Entrance and a nine-story building to the north-east, Tsuruya-cho tower (\u9db4\u5c4b\u753a\u68df, Tsuruyamachi-t\u014d), which will include parking and childcare facilities.\n\n\n== Passenger statistics ==\nIn fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 406,594 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the busiest JR East station in Kanagawa Prefecture and the fourth-busiest on the JR East network as a whole.The JR East passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of East Japan Railway Company stations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJR-East Yokohama Station information\nKeikyu Railway Train and Bus information\nTokyu Railway information\nYokohama Minatomirai railway information\nS\u014dtetsu Line Yokohama Station Map\nTransportation Bureau, City of Yokohama (Municipal Subway and Bus)",

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds.

          "Expensive but beautiful. The sauna is a funny set up, me and her thought we\u2019d get to spend time together but it\u2019s split into male and female areas. Was here for a wedding and the Japanese people were tremendous. Yokohama and Tokyo are amazing. The hotel was fantastic. Definitely",
          "Amazing views from the observation deck and lots of good places to eat in the food court at the 3rd floor. About $10 US per person which is fair.",
          "Landmark Tower is a hive of activities for the young, teens and adults. Loads of shopping center and lots of eateries...make your choice and view the bill boards at every eatery. All kinds of foods to choice from, Italian, American, Indian dishes, Japanese is the choice if",
          "If the weather permits, you will enjoy the stunning views from the top of the 296m tower. The fastest elevator in Japan will reach the speed of the 750/m per minute and will bring you to the observation deck. Loved everything about the tower, elevator, observation deck, and",
          "you will definitely pass this area from the station all the way to the seaside near minato mirai mall",
          "Once arriving at the JR Yokohama station change for the JR train to Sakuragichco. You will be right near the Landmark Building. Look for the outside escalator. It will be out to your left. It is covered. Then walk to the building and look for signs to the Landmark Tower Sky",
          "The whole tower is a good place to find food and do some shopping. They offer covered walk ways for pedestrians and moving walk ways that open at 7am from one of the stations. The trip to the top is nice but make sure it will be a clear day to see everything. There is a",

          "This building is along the waterfront of Yokohama. There a small amusement park right next to hit with a large ferris wheel, there is a sailing ship museum, You can go upstairs into the Tower to get a view of the city. Honestly, nothing special unless you like to take sky",
          "This looks impressive from afar and just huge when up close next to the Tower which shows off the impressive architecture here amongst the local skyline",
          "A typical high rise viewing platform. However Yokohama has a surprisingly impressive skyline which on a clear day you can see Tokyo. There is an extensive gift shop and a bar so you can chill out and enjoy the view with a beer. Good value.",
          "The landmark tower is an excellent place to use as a point of focus when walking around the Minato Mirai disctrict and figuring out your location. Apparently the place is loaded with various shopping and eating establishments as well. If you want to get a nice view of Yokohama",
          "The views were great, altough Mt. Fuji stayed hidden. The tower is right on the water so the view of the ocean is phenomenal. Depending on the weather you can see for miles even to Tokyo Tower. My wife keeps taking me up these towers.",
          "It is a little pricy but the views are nice and everything is labeled above the window so you know what you are looking at. There is a small bar on the viewing deck and a gift shop. The only other thing to see is some history about the building while waiting to go up.",
          "Fabulous modern building offerings lots of shops and eateries. If you like shopping this is the place for you. Worth checking out.",
          "I stayed at the hotel in this building. The views from the 70th floor were excellent. The attached mall was a typical mall.",

          "Landmark Tower is so centrally located that tourists can easily use it as \u2018the landmark\u2019 when they walk around Yokohama. When approach the tower, the wide platforms along the elevated walkway are well decorated with various seasonal booths. The elevated walkways are amazingly",

          "It's surrounded by nice are, park, old ship, mall and other areas to stroll and take nice picture. It's walking distance from Sakuragicho station and Minato Mirai area. C U Around",
          "We went up the tower to the observation deck on the 69th floor. There are great views across Yokohama. Well worth going up the tower. There is also a souvenir shop. We also had a wander around the shopping mall on the lower levels after we had been up the tower. There was quite",
          "the elevator ride is an experience of itself. It is more a catapult than elevator! The views are good, but why there is such meagre information on the story boards beats me. A big draw is the selfie area- shaped like a heart, with lineups of people eager to photograph",
          "Lots of shops, eateries and fun to be had. My partner used to work in the upper floors. There's also a very good observation deck on the roof where on a clear day fui can be viewed resulting in some great photos.",
          "The tallest building in Yokohama. Great views during the evening especially from Minato Mirai. The building is also visible from Tokyo Haneda airport observation decks.",
          "The Landmark Tower is a must-visit in Tokyo. The Tower features the fastest elevator in Japan, and you will be transported to the top floor in the blink of an eye. From the top of the tower you can see not only Minato Mirai, but most of the South-Eastern part of Japan. It's",
          "The true landmark of ultimate premium shopping in Tokyo starts in this mall. Very elegant and fashionable way to enjoy your shopping in Yokohama.",

          "The tower is part of a shopping centre, a hotel and a great observation deck to look over the city. The tower is visible from most parts of the city and so if lost just look for it. We caught the bus to Haneda Airport from this tower.",
          "No crowds, just bought our tickets aNd straight to the 69th floor in 40 seconds. The view is spectacular but unfortunately couldn\u2019t quite see mt Fuji. We spent about 15 minutes looking as far as the eye could see then took 5he lift back down.",
          "Not much to say really. Another city, another high vantage point in a fairly unique looking building. I tend to find these places look better if you\u2019re looking at it from afar as to being inside! On a clear day though, you can apparently see as far as Tokyo and Fuji so bring",
          "This tower observatory is where to see the best view of Mt. Fuji. But since it is so often covered in clouds, the ticket counter has an update on viewing. So if Mt. Fuji isn't visible, you won't waste you money traveling to the top. The downstairs mall is like the US - hardrock",
          "A great point of reference in this area. Magnificent granite structure with soothing waterfalls beside the endless staircases.",
          "Amazing view all over Tokyo, also you can see the Mount Fuji (good weather)! Fastest elevator to the 69 floor! One of the highest buildings from Japan. You can reach the tower for Free with the JR-Pass. There are 2 different train stations so be aware where you go back. In",

          "30 minute walk from Yokohama Station, passing thru the Nisson World Gallery, modern shopping streets, the art museum, fountains for kids to play in, and finally the vast shopping area below the Landmark Tower. Or a 10 minute walk from Sakuraguicho Station, which is just as",
          "I've spent a surprising amount of time in the Landmark Tower. My company's offices are about halfway up the tower and I've stayed at the Royal Park Hotel which occupies around 25 of the upper floors. The view out of the building is nothing short of spectacular. On a clear",
          "This is a combination of the breathtaking view of the Yokohama bay area and an exhilarating elevator ride.",

          "We visited here to see the Christmas decorations, but were a little disappointed. The mall and surrounding area is supposed to be decorated for the holidays with a Nutcracker theme. Inside, there are only 3 areas that are set up as photo spots, plus the a couple of large trees.",
          "Take the lift up for 500 Yen, and enjoy the view. Fast lift and very good service here. If you are lucky then you can see to Tokyo",

          "Met my wife in Japan at end of her business trip on April 2014. The tower is the 2nd tallest building in Japan and it has all the latest tech that you can imagine. Staff is exceptionally efficient and friendly. Convenient location in the middle of the Minato Mirai 21",
          "This building has lots of artwork to view, esp. mosaics. There is a convenient beer garden on the bottom floor. To get a table outdoors, must order the BBQ meal because of the smoke.",

          "This is a rather dull building from the outside but from the top it is amazing! Well worth the cost to go up on the world's fastest lift. It was sooo smooth that it was only the fact that my ears popped that told me I was going up!",
          "The adventure begins when you reach the 69th floor by Japan's fastest elevator just in seconds. The Yokohama port and Minato-Mirai area are under your foot. I recommend to visit this tower at sunset after visiting all other palaces around (Red brick warehouse, Yokohama Int.",
          "I been Up different towers and building yes love the view from all of them but this one I really liked it has ocean view, city, and mountains. If you like or love Godzilla movie poster in the view up top but probably because the movie just opened so not sure those will stay for",
          "Compare to Sky Tree Tower in Tokyo, it`s not that much attractions like Senjio Ji or some buildings to be seen from a tower, but still, it`s quite fascinating and half the price cheaper though~ XD When it gets dark at around 7 or 8pm, the lights around is beautiful, especially",
          "Going up the tallest building in the fastest lift in the world was great fun and the views at the top were just amazing as the skies were really clear and we could see for miles. Being able to have views from different vantage points was great. There is a cafe and also drinks",
          "Well, I have observed in Japan, they have connected malls. Landmark is connected to Queen's Square. Landmark is very huge and has a moving walkway connected to Sakuragicho station, it is very convenient to tourists.",
          "This used to be the tallest building in japan..apparently built on wheels to cope with the seismic activity. Beautiful restaurant on the last floor and lovely hotel on the upper end of the tower. There is a nice mall underground and the hotel is linked to sakuragicho station.",
          "If you are going to be in Yokohama and near the harbor, the Landmark Tower is a must to see. Try and visit on a beautiful sunny day, if you are lucky you will see Mt. Fuji, Tokyo Tower in the distance and if you are there when the sun sets, it's amazing, it's like Mt. Fuji is",

          "Landmark tower is not only central to Minato Mirai, but full of atractions: great restaurants - you will be spoilt by choice, great shops - though certainly expensive and famous 69th floor observation deck. One sushi restaurant is exceptionally good - Uogishi zushi on 5th floor,",
          "Basically that is what it is. Lots of brand name shops, very very nice restaurants. Probably more choice than Queen tower.",
          "Great view of Yokohama and bay. Price is very reasonable. It depends on weather, but this is true for all observation decks.",
          "You get to experience the fastest elevator in Japan if only for just under 40 seconds... until you reach sky garden on the 69th floor of the Landmark Tower, where you can enjoy 360-degree panoramic views over Yokohama and on clear days you can see Mount Fuji. Time your visit",

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds. The elevators' speed record was surpassed by elevators of Taipei 101 (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h) in 2004.\nThe building was designed by the architecture and engineering division of Mitsubishi Estate, now Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei and Hugh Stubbins and Associates, later KlingStubbins.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Japan\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest freestanding steel structures\nList of records of Japan\nList of public observation decks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Landmark Tower official site\n Geographic data related to Yokohama Landmark Tower at OpenStreetMap",

          "We went in June 2020. Absolutely no one was up there. The bar/cafe serves great stuff. Nothing better than a beer or coffee looking at a stunning view. When it was empty it was amazing, I'm sure it would lose its appeal as it gets more crowded.",

          "After missing out on seeing Fuji for the majority of my trip, it was a beautiful and clear day the morning of my flight. I wandered around taking some Sakura photos and then I saw the sign indicating that you could see Mt. Fuji from the Sky Garden! I hurried, bought a ticket",
          "It was totally worth the money to get to the top! We were able to see sunset over Mt Fuji and watch Yokohama light up for the night.",
          "At Landmark Tower you have a nice view around the Yokohama bay. Inside there are a lot of shops and restaurants. I had a great time.",
          "Simply the best place to visit in the winter, with clear skies in Japan, make sure you see Mt Fuji with a covering of snow, and no cloud. The 69th floor caf\u00e9 faces the direction of Fuji, so you can have a seat, and eat/drink and watch the fabulous Winter sunsets behind Fuji.",
          "After a ride up a fast elevator, you're greeted with a great view of Yokohama and the surrounding areas.",
          "Priced right on the right nights, or consecutive nights, and worth the price. Good view day or night. Good amenities. Attached to Queen Square mall, high end shopping and always a display, event, and art to see.",
          "The food was nice, slightly pricey. The only reason didn't give 5 stars is because they got my order wrong and I had to wait for the correct order to be brought out The cocktails were great (and cheap)",
          "It's a 1000Yen trip to the top of the highest skyscraper in the Kanto region. And it's worth it. I haven't enjoyed anything the skygarden, but the view. In winter there is often a great view to the snow capped Mt. Fuji.",
          "The building has the fastest elevator to the top floor 69th within 10 secs. I love the view and ice-cream there.",
          "Well worth the trip to the top to get 360 degrees of Yokohama from some 270m up in the sky. On a clear day not only you can see the suburbs of Tokyo which are highlighted / identified in matching photos above the viewing windows but also of Mount Fuji. Local landmarks and",
          "Amazing views from this building, including in the elevator. Going at night is definitely better with all the lights of the attractions around it and colours reflecting off the water.",
          "Had to ride the high speed elevator & see the grand view, got to see Fugisan with snow. Well worth the charge for the ride. Also wonderful high quality shopping in the tower. Enjoy!!",
          "I would highly recommend a trip to the top of the landmark tower when you\u2019re in Yokohama. Breathtaking views whichever way you turn and small lessons of history dotted on the walls of the viewing deck.",
          "Japan was quiet hot during July and then rainy as well, finding this area was great as you could sit have a beverage and then look around the city and mt fuji Fabulous.",
          "The Sky Garden can provide wonderful 360 degree views from Yokohama Bay. If it is hazy or raining, don't bother as you won't see much, but when it's clear, you'll see for miles. There are signs above the windows pointing out important landmarks.",
          "Fast elevator to the top, Great view on a clear day. A few good wall maps show the keypoints and places nearby. Some interesting gift shops as you walk around. A nice touch for photographers is that the ceiling lights are recessed so that they don't appear as reflections in the",
          "Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden is definitely worth visiting if you want to see Mount Fuji without having to travel to Mount Fuji. The Sky Garden is so high up that you can see Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Sky Tree as well as Mount Fuji by looking out the window. The fee to go to",
          "Its amazing tower and have world fastest elevater. it go up 64 blocks withing seconds..marvelous pictures square when we observed top of the tower.",
          "Went up here in the early evening and really enjoyed the experience, Great views over the city in every direction. No cues and not too expensive either.",
          "I have been here before but believe the view is worth the charge. I can't remember exact fee but around 1000 yen for adults and less for pensioners,kids. Taken up to viewing platform within seconds. you can spend as long as you like talking photos from four different angles",
          "The entry fee is 1,000 yen and we arrived at about 5:30pm to see the views at day time, sunset and night time. It was truly incredible! We even saw Mount Fuji and parts of Tokyo in the distance. There is also a restaurant/bar and a shop with souvenirs. I think we ended up",
          "You have to pay a fee to go up to the observatory. Best time to go up is between 5pm - 6.30pm because you'll get day shots and night shots of Yokohama bay area. Yokohama is one of the most beautiful city at night. Overlooking the iconic view of the Cosmo World and",
          "Top views but not sure if worth the money to see. Given we were staying at the Park Royal Hotel the views from our hotel room were spectacular without spending the extra for the Sky Garden. Annoying to be staying in the actual hotel and not being allowed to the bar to purchase a",
          "On a clear sunny day, you will be able to see up to Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree. If you are really lucky, you can get a fantastic view of Mt. Fuji. You can ask the staff before buying tickets if the skies are clear or not. Sometimes they give discounts if the weather is bad",
          "This place is one the best place to have some drinks while enjoying the view of Yokohama and, if your lucky, Mt. Fuji!",
          "The Landmark Tower can be seen from almost anywhere in Yokohama-shi. The area around it is pretty cool in its own right, but the view of it from this observation deck is fairly spectacular. I went at night, and the 360 degree view of downtown Yokohama is breathtaking. There were",
          "Towers can tend to be too pricey for what they offer, but not the Landmark Tower. Not only were the views impressive, but the photos showing the views in 1993, and 2012, allows the viewer to get a feel for the development in the city over time. Even though we didn't see Mt. Fuji",
          "This is a beautiful landmark in Yokohama, full of shops and restaurants. A nice building when viewed at night from the bay.",
          "The observation deck is on the 69th floor and is free to enter. You can get great 360 degree views looking over Yokohama city and the bay with its impressive bridges. Definitely the best viewing spot in Yokohama",
          "I honestly thought this was going to be a minor curiosity. Go up, take a look at the view and go back down. Done and dusted in 10 minutes. Boy was I wrong. First of all, the view is AMAZING. Maybe it helped that the weather was clear and sunny when I was there. In the",
          "This tower has the fastest elevator in Japan. It is in the Guinness book of records! Cool. The view from the deck is great and in sunny weather you can see Fuji! The deck is never crowded you can enjoy it!",
          "fastest lift in the World (Guinness book) for a very beautiful view on Yokohama on its port.. I would recommend to go end of day to stay for the night lights as well...",
          "Lovely views over Yokohama at the Landmark tower, even better at night when everything is lit up. Great for some panaramic photography of the city",
          "Loved the mall and the plaza Everything clean but not clinical The lift ride fab and the view 360 amazing No crowds when we went on a Tuesday Really interesting",
          "I heard there was an observation deck in this building, so I thought I would check it out. To get here you have to go into the Landmark Plaza, which has a lot of cool places to shop & eat. And just follow the signs, that will take you to get to the tower. I got here rather",
          "We got reduced entrance fee for my 65+ husband. The lift takes you up to the 69th floor very quickly. Great views all around Yokohama. Worth being on your list of things to do in Yokohama.",
          "Excellent location if you like taking photos. The trick is to get there just before the evening sun to catch the cross over to night view.",
          "Good view over Yokohama and a great chance to see the sun setting over Mt Fuji. A little disappointed that it's cash only but at 1000yen for an adult it's very good value.",
          "The lift takes you very quickly to the 69th Floor of this building at maximum speed of 750m/min for stunning views of Yokohama skyline, Yokohama and the surrounding areas.",
          "Yes, the view is awesome. There is a bar serving a limited choice of drinks and sofas in front of the large windows, making it a relaxing place to have a break from an hectic day.... However, if you wish to go to a real bar with the same -and less crowded- view, then just go the",
          "A great experience, from the ride in Japan's fastest lift up Japan's tallest building. Panoramic views of the whole Yokohama and Tokyo area, with Mt Fuji the main reason to visit/view. Restaurant on the observation level to get drink and food. Admission is \u00a51,000.",
          "This spot offers 360 degrees of overview of Yokohama and beyond. A nice time to go is the change over from day to night as the view changes so radically. On a good clear day you can see Mt.Fuji, which is always a bonus.",
          "The Landmark Tower Sky Gardens offer great 360 views of Yokohama. It's especially nice during sunset or at night once the theme parks light come on.",
          "Great view from the Sky Garden, on the north one can see Tokyo landmarks, on the south the bay bridge and on the west the Fuji-san. In cloudless weather people crowd for Fuji sunset view, and in my opinion it is completely worth it.",
          "The roof of the landmark tower offers some awesome views around the area and on a clear day Fuji-san can be snapped too. Definitely worth the visit on a clear and nice day.",
          "First make sure that day is clear before you go up unless all you want to see is the nearby city. Go up a bit before sunset so you can get both the day and night view. Winter time usually the best season for a clear view and the holiday season is extra special for viewing the",
          "free for tourist to entrance you can see the yokohama bay with diverse colors , it's very romantic! good for photography! (bring your tripod)",
          "Brilliant tower experience about $20AUS but worth it. Allow about 2 hours to view in detail each section. Clear day you can even see Mt Fuji in the distance.",
          "Perhaps the most most beautiful view from any building at night in Yokohama from the city's tallest building. If you are staying here at the hotel or just shopping in the mall below, I really recommend taking the super fast lift to the Sky Garden. From the top you can see across",
          "The lift to the top is super fast and then the views are fantastic. We spent quite a bit of time taking in the view and getting a feel for the layout of the town. Tokyo was visible in the distance. There were lots of school children there too.",
          "We were wowed by this view. More reasonably priced than the Tokyo Sky Tree (also an amazing view but (~3x the price) and a great way to take in the bay view. Would definitely recommend doing this if you go to Yokohama!",
          "At first I would recommend to visit here at night to get a better view (in my opinion) of Yokohama. Night view is super good. Access and information: It's hard for me to find the right way but just go straight into the building and ask for way to Sky Garden, friendly staff will",
          "This was a great view of Yokohama and well worth the small cost. I personally had a hard time finding the entrance, you have to be on a certain floor to catch the ticket office and elevator so look for the maps. The elevator is the fastest elevator in Japan as certified by",
          "The Landmark Tower is a must visit in Yokohama. The lift (elevator) to the 69th is blisteringly fast! Entry fee was 1000 yen which is reasonable. There is a nice restaurant/ bar on the observation floor with comfy seats so you can relax and enjoy the views. It has a relaxed",
          "The observation deck on the 69th floor offers impressive panaromic views of the whole of Yokohama. We went there at the night to avoid the lenghty line of visitors (which we did) and enjoyed the super fast elevator ride upto the deck and then a relatively less crowded deck to",
          "Very good height & price. Suprised not busier! It's fantastic. Better than SkyTree as you can walk around, not busy at all when we went, a cafe to sit on their sofas and chill out for abit. Look at the views, so good!! Go here!!",
          "Well worth the 1000 yen to get the 360\u00ba view of the skyline. Look at the old versus new pictures located along the periphery. Food in the building is just so-so.",
          "I loved going to the top of this tower. The view was spectacular. I went in the daytime, but I'm sure the nighttime view would be awesome as well. I also liked the shopping on the lower floors. It's a must if you're in Yokohama.",
          "Breathtaking view from 69th floor, especially in the night. Great architecture and technology used in this building. The elevator from ground floor to the 69th floor is one of the fastest in the world.",
          "Good place for shop and view all Yokohama and Fuji Sam from the Sky Tower, good experience and fun for all.",
          "My second visit to this 360 dregree view of Yokahama and Mount Fuji. I went on a clear day with a friend of mine and this time I was lucky enough to visit on a clear day so we had a wonderful view of Mount Fuji. The tower is situated in a large shopping mall - an added bonus",
          "We pretty much stumbled across this place but actually really enjoyed our visit. There's a great view from the top, as you would expect, and the shop sells some pretty cool stuff. The entrance is in a shopping centre - we bought some weird cheesecake cake which was so sweet it",
          "Yokohama land tower is one of the biggest in Yokohama it has a 65 floor building and there u can see a roof top of Yokohama. U will be given 15 minutes also 1000 yen is the cost. Going on weekends may be bit hectic. Overall a very nice place",
          "Don't go here looking for amazing service or excellent drinks...go for the stunning views. Expensive, service & drinks a let down, but it's worth seeing it at least once- 70th floor with views over Yokohama & on to Tokyo.",
          "The visit of a lifetime! Not to be missed. We visited the bar at the top of the tower and the views are stunning. It is not cheap but it is worth it especially if you are a King Kong fan as they have some original film adverts in the gallery.",
          "On our own in Yokohama from a cruise ship, Landmark Tower is a short walk across covered walkways, some moving from the main train station and shuttle bus drop off (about 5 minutes). The tower boasts the fastest elevator in Japan, 750meters per minute for the trip from the 2nd",
          "The landmark hotel in Yokohama , Japan is slightly unusual in that the lobby is on the ground floor and then the guest rooms start on the 59th Floor , so if your afraid of heights this isn't for you . The immediate impression is good . The lobby area is bright and there are",
          "1000 yen for adults 800 yen for students offers you a great view of the entire city and bay. You can see Mount Fuji on a clear day. Overall it's a decent value if the weather is great.",
          "Whilst the entry fee is a little expensive I am glad we went. Seeing Mt Fuji is always a risk in the summer as there are many hazy days. Happy we went.",
          "We saw that Mt. Fuji was visible so paid to go to the Sky Garden. It is pricey for just a good view in my opinion. The drinks were not great (even the waiter tried to discourage us from buying them) because they use low grade alcohol. The views are great if it is clear. I",
          "Visited here with my partner in June 2015 and it was a great experience. The bar at the top was really nice with spectacular views overlooking Tokyo Bay. The fast elevator ride to the sky garden at the top was an experience in itself. Great service from staff and beautiful",
          "passed by and walked on this area only to see a lot of sights to behold especially during night time!",
          "If you are into high buildings and great views I can recommend a visit to Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden. Go on a clear day and you will see Fuji San and Tokyo. There is a cafe where you can get refreshments and sit and enjoy the view. I spent about an hour.",
          "Pretty simple offering. Quick lift ride up. Wander around. Have a coffee and look all around. No surprises and worth a trip.",
          "We did a few observation decks in and around Tokyo and I really enjoyed this one. We were lucky to see Mt Fuji which was a great experience. They do tell you before you go up if you can see Mt Fuji. If that's what you're going to see, you don't have to pay and be disappointed.",
          "We have not climbed up to the Observation Deck on the top due to time limitation although it would offer visitors to have birds' eye view over the surrounding bay area. Instead we did certain shopping on lower floors and left for other parts of the town. If you have time,",
          "Good shopping with a wide range of shops to cater your needs. Plenty of restaurants, cheaper ones on the 1/F and basement but a lot of good deals throughout. A mini supermarket with good desserts and fruits.",
          "This was the second high building we had visited and it was so good. Access is good, the staff are so polite and helpful and the cafe up top is great for relaxing and taking in the marvellous vistas.",
          "One of the best viewpoints in the larger Yokohama and Tokyo areas. The 360 degree view enables one to observe most of Yokohama and have a good view of Mt. Fuji, better than what can be seen from Tokyo as the mountain-range covers part of the mountain.",
          "I went there on Friday late afternoon and the place wasn't crowded at all (Which is the reason I prefer this tower to any of the Tokyo towers). We stayed for an hour at the sofas in the garden cafe which is on the west side of the observatory. I would've given it 5 starts if",
          "There is an observation deck on top of the building. I have not enter due to it costs admission fee. But you can shopping next to this building.",
          "An unique place to the world. wonderful architecture in this building.the great thing is evening sunset with this building is very beautiful.I didn't wend up to the building because of the time I was not enough for me.But one day I will go there definitely",
          "The view is truly spectacular but does not merit the extremely high prices for the restaurant. Also, the food wasn't even good,",
          "We stopped in here on a Monday morning - was well worth it as we could hang out and have a drink while over looking the city. We barely could make out Mt Fuji. Would be spectacular to see on a clear day.",
          "This was ok but unlike Tokyo Tower or Tokyo Skytree, which we visited prior, there is no good signage explanation of what you're looking at. So it's a great view if you're local or know the area but if you're new to Yokohama, it's so so.",
          "The Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden is Japan's highest observatory deck. You get a 360-degree view of Yokohama city and beyond. It's worth a visit for the breathtaking view.",
          "Every big city must have a view tower this this. The view of Yokohama is nice but no surprises. People could spend 30 minutes for look around here and enjoy the food on the restaurant here.",
          "I visited Landmark tower with my family and it was not as great as I expected and pretty expensive, you can view similar scenes from any other building. Only elevator was impressive! It is not recommended to visit in the evening since you will not see the whole scene!",
          "Fair price for entrance. Fast lift and very good service from the staff. Clear day and then a good view over the whole harbour/city",
          "The highest building in Japan. A must-go landmark in Yokohama from where you can see the splendid panorama of Minato-Mirai.",
          "Highly recomend to go to the 69 floor at dusk when all the lights are on. Amazing view for every side of the city.",
          "Definitely gained the appreciation of the view once I made it to the top! The way up was exciting with the group I was in. The city is beautiful from the tower!!!!",
          "The view was magnificent and gave a great overview of the city. It was a pretty clear day and we could see Tokyo Tower in the distance but due to cloud we could not see Mount Fuji. Well worth the visit to see how big the city really is.",
          "We visited on a misty day but were not disapointed with 360degrees panoramic views all around. On a clear day you can see Mt Fuji and the ranges, Located on the 69th floor with a lift in under a minute and speed of 750 metres per minute.\\Outstanding views.",
          "I am always a big fan of lights. Christmas lights,illumination,city lights etc. And my boyfriend surprise me with this stunning view of city lights from 69floor Sky Garden Yokohama Landmark Tower.Great place to visit. You get to experience riding the fastest elevator in Japan to",
          "I enjoyed the views here, you can see the Minato Mirai ferris wheel which changes colors in time with the music in the tower. There are also a lot of vendo machines so you can grab a hot or cold drink while enjoying the views without breaking that bank!",
          "A bird's eye view cannot adequately describe the scenic beauty you are given when you reach the top floor. It's a must try and at a good day, you can take a peak of Mt. Fuji!",
          "This was amazing. Go up before dusk when the weather is clear. We saw the sunset with Mount Fuji and then the amazing city lights come on. We went in Summer on a Tuesday evening and it was not too crowded at all.",
          "We liked the view from the top however we didn't think anything special. Of course the crowd wasn't that crazy like Sky tree. At least you had better chance for a good view (not blocked by others).",
          "On an extremely hot and humid day, it was worth visiting the Landmark Tower just for the air conditioning! First we shopped in the mall on the lower floors[ a must for Studio Ghibli fans] and then queued for the lift to the observation deck. I had been pre-warned that the lift",
          "We managed to go there without any rush hour. there was no line at all. Payment is decent 1800 Yen. There was a gude at the elevator who spoke only japanese. So the story didnt tell us so much. Anyway the floorindicator and speedometer at the \"turbolift\" were amusing. It was",
          "Located in Minaro Mirai, Yokohama Landmark Tower bring to you the perfect observation desk. In clear day, you can see the top of Fujji Mountain from here.",
          "The Sky Garden of Yokohama Landmark Tower offers a stunningly beautiful view of Mt. Fuji, Yokohama, and the surrounding areas, which include Tokyo on a clear day. At night the bright lights from the surrounding are romantic as well. The super fast elevator ride up to the top was",
          "Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden - there's perfect view of Mt. Fuji, Yokohama harbour and Tokyo Metropolis. In march there were no queues, so in 3 minutes very fast elevator takes me to the top witch 360 degrees view. I can definitely recommend this attraction.",
          "Here you upload fastest elevator for 60 seconds to the top. The views are 360 * You can have a drink in Sky kafe.",
          "I enjoyed going to the top of the Tower. Great views and ride up was very quick with no lines. Compared to SkyTree in Tokyo it was much more relaxed.",
          "Nice views especially at night. Located on top floor of what used to be japan's tallest building. Drinks can be expensive however the views worth it.",
          "Though nothing much as attraction for a tourist, but you can visit this tower for shopping, eating, and having a look of whole Yokohama from the top.",
          "Thought we had probably had to try and see as much as we could as only in the city for the day and here we saw everything from a great height. The lift goes from first to sixty ninth floor in 35 seconds. The views are spectacular, you really can see Tokyo!",
          "We needed to be in Minato Mirai to see a friend of mine. We decided to check out the Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden since it was very sunny when we went. The tower's elevator that goes up to the Sky Garden speeds up to 12.5 m/s, making it the fastest elevator in Japan.",
          "The Landmark Tower is not among the tallest buildings in the world, but not far behind. Other than the Sky Tree in Tokyo, it is the tallest building in Japan and provides a fabulous view of the Yokohama waterfront and city. The cost of 1000 yen (less for seniors) is reasonable",
          "Very colourful city in the evening and there was plenty to do in the tower. We got our cartoonish portrait painted in the tower, which was quite a souvenir. However, we don't know if it was worth the trip from Tokyo as the area surrounding seemed like a business district.",
          "Though a bit pricey to get to the top on a clear day it's quite fantastic. One can see the entire Y bay and all the main buildings.",
          "Landmark Tower used to be the highest building in Japan. Now it is any more, but the view from its Sky Garden is still worth to admire. You can take a look of the entire Minato Mirai areas. Its night view is really impressive.",
          "The tower may not appeal to everyone, but the views certainly will. One of the fastest elevators in Japan will transport you up (or down) in around 40 seconds. Best time to go would be for a two-hour+ time slot just before dusk so that you get to appreciate the view in daylight",
          "When you get to the viewing floor of this you can enjoy a sight as far as the eye can see of the area. There is an entrance fee to get in, that is quite the only negative in this.",
          "I'm pretty sure this is the place we went. Not sure if there is a separate name for where we were, if it was a lounge or bar proper. But here goes... Our friends took us here after a swank dinner at Yokohama Serina (delicious beef). Men are both engineers, so they loved the",
          "The tallest structure in Yokohama, it offers great view of the Yokohama city and its adjoining bay area. There is an entry fee to be paid for getting to the view point atop the building but its worth spending.",
          "Great views from the top of the tower. You can more or less see all of Yokohama and even Mount Fuji during a clear day.",
          "We were amazingly surprised of the beautiful views that Landmark Tower Sky Garden offers to all tourist who decides to visit the building. The entrance is not free, but it is very worth to go up to the top and have a relaxing time as you can sit down on the couches and enjoy of",
          "Landmark Tower is the second tallest building (296.3 meters high) in Japan and boasts one of the highest observation decks in Japan. It also has a five-star hotel in addition to many businesses. But it's most famous for its 69th floor observatory, Sky Garden, where one has a",
          "A nice place to get a view of Yokohama. There are restaurants and a few things to do up there too - such as getting a fun caricature portrait or a little souvenir shopping in.",
          "This used to be the highest tower in Japan,until the Tokyo Skytree Tower opened recently.This is still a very worth while place to visit,and gives a wonderful panorama view to the City.It is also near Yokohamas China Town \"Chukagui\"",
          "We went here on a suggestion and loved it. The price was minimal for the time we spent looking at all of Yokohama and surrounding area from up high. We took lots of pictures and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",
          "We went to look out at the harbour and view and you will not be disappointed . So clear and the lights wow with the Ferris wheel right there . We had some cocktails and then dinner down stairs",
          "It is pretty high up alright and it offers a couple of good views from some of the vantage points but all in all it really wasn't that special or worth the ticket. I am sure if you have traveled you have seen city skylines before.",
          "I've been there several times. Every time I went there, I could enjoy the different beautiful views. During the day, I saw the whole city of Yokohama, the Tokyo Tower and the Sky Tree. I got chances to see the Mt. Fuji twice. It was amazing. (Of course, it depends on the weather",
          "This isn't noted by most reviewers, but the Sky Garden isn't a garden, it's totally indoors, but it does provide 360 degree views through panaormaic windows over the whole of Yokohama and beyond. We visited on a lovely clear and sunny day, and could easily see to and beyond",
          "One of the coolest places to shoot photos from a tall structure in Japan is in Yokohama at the Landmark Tower\u2019s Sky Garden. Located on the top in the 69th floor is the Landmark Tower Yokohama observation deck (Yokohama Sky Promenade) which is 273m high. The Landmark Tower has",
          "Landmark Tower offers a spectacular view of Yokohama! On a day with clear skies, such as when I went, you can even get a great of Tokyo and be able to see the Tokyo Skytree and Tokyo Tower. When your done beholding the view of the surrounding city you can literally shop until",

          "Great views (as you\u2019d expect) over Yokohama and even the silhouette of Mount Fuji appeared in the distance, out of the haze during sunset on my visit. The Sky Garden isn\u2019t a garden though; it\u2019s an indoors experience only. If you are keen on taking photos, something to shroud",

          "Between the express elevator that hit a top speed of 65 k.p.h. on the way to the 69th floor, and the forever views, this was a great experience. On the day I visited, Mt. Fuji was only just visit on the inland horizon and the urban sprawl north, west and south, wasn't that",

          "The views were nice, and the little shops were cute, but not for 1000 yen. This should have been 500 yen, tops. The Tokyo Tower at 800 yen was a much better experience. I know they can charge this much because it's the only observatory in Yokohama, but it's price-gouging. I say,",
          "This is one of the best towers I have been up, the view is amazing. From the 69th floor you see pretty much the whole city. We like the view of the harbour the best. The ride up is very quick. Overall it was well worth the admission. (April 2014)",

          "We went up to the viewing level on the 69th floor, the views were good, however I'm sure the views of Fuji at sunset on a clear day would be excellent from here. There is also a gift shop and bar on the viewing floor.",
          "The view from the top is impressive. The lift ride to go up is super fast. The only downfall was, that the lady at the ticket counter was not so friendly and did not understand/speak English to give information. Apart of her great staff :)",

          "A great view of Yokohama and the harbor. It's a great view of the harbor and amusement park at night. On a clear day (not too often) you can see Mt. Fuji.",
          "Beautiful 360 view of Yokohama. The bay and mountain views are spectacular. Have a snack and a drink at the cafe and enjoy the view while you sit on a leather couch. Elevator to the top is the fastest in Japan, 750meters per hour. You won't feel it though, but your ears will",
          "Great views from the top over the bay area with its multitude of new buildings, and also of the old town, and at \u00a51000 per adult not a bad price. Restaurant and souvenir shop also at the top plus plenty space just to sit and relax, not normally something you get in a viewing",
          "Even though it is by the sea, it didn't impress me as Tokyo Tower did. Still it worths to visit when you are there. But there are higher place now such as Landmark Tower, but I don't know how much it costs.",

          "The whole shopping plaza is huge - but we didn't have time to explore. It was hard to find the lift so recommend you allow more time. It would have been great to see the hotel and perhaps have something to eat there but eventually found the lift to the top so just went up. It",

          "Sadly Mt Fuji was concealed by mist. Good value visit. Same height as London's Shard - almost 20% of the price!",
          "The observation floor of this highest building in the Tokyo area offers amazing views. More even than the views, it offers comfort! the windows are plentiful and the viewing areas large. They even had seating. I felt we were welcome to stay as long as we wished.",
          "We went as a family (with a small child) and had a meal in the restaurant in the Landmark Tower. The views through the full length windows are outstanding across Tokyo and the bay. The lift is really fast. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the staff brilliant.",

          "The lift up is amazing, you don't even notice your moving, yet it goes very fast. When you step out at the top the view takes your breath away. In fact it is entertaining just watching people get out of the lift and their reaction to the view. Can see Fuji if it's clear",
          "Let me start out by saying we are from Seattle. A place where it costs you your first born to go to the stop of the space needle where you can buy a mediocre coffee with your second born and get some half decent views. THE LANDMARK TOWER IS AMAZING. It only costs 1000 YEN A",

          "I think this may be the highest building in Yokohama and is probably the highest viewpoint for tourists. There is nothing in particular more to say except the view is fantastic and you can look down on some of the best tourist attractions in the area. I liked Yokohama a lot and",

        "wiki": "The Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse (\u6a2a\u6d5c\u8d64\u30ec\u30f3\u30ac\u5009\u5eab, Yokohama Akarenga S\u014dko) is a historical building that is used as a complex that includes a shopping mall, banquet hall, and event venues. The complex, officially known as the Newport Pier Bonded Warehouse (\u65b0\u6e2f\u57e0\u982d\u4fdd\u7a0e\u5009\u5eab, Shink\u014d Fut\u014d Hozei S\u014dko), was originally used as customs buildings, and has two sections: Warehouse No.1 and No.2. It is operated by Yokohama Akarenga Co. Ltd., and located at the Port of Yokohama in Naka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Yokohama city government worked on constructing new harbour facilities, and the first reclamation work was begun in 1899. The work, completed in 1905, was followed by expansion work which ended a year later. Planned by a Japanese architect and a government official, Tsumaki Yorinaka, the current Building No. 2 was constructed in 1911, and the current Building No. 1 was erected in 1913. Both were to be used as customs houses.\n\nWhen the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake struck Yokohama, the red brick buildings were damaged, but suffered less than other buildings due to their reinforced structure with iron implanted between the bricks. Repair work continued until 1930, and after World War II, the buildings were requisitioned by the American occupation troops between 1945 and 1956. After the buildings were returned to Japan, their use decreased with the advent of containerization, and the buildings ended their role as customs houses in 1989.\nIn 1992, Yokohama city acquired jurisdiction over the buildings, and restoration work was carried out from 1994 to 1999. This work, in which the roof and structure of the buildings were strengthened, was conducted by Takenaka Corporation, a Japanese architectural company. After the inside of the buildings was renovated, they were opened as the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse on April 12, 2002.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe complex is divided into buildings No. 1 and No. 2. Both buildings are three stories high, and are 22.6 metres wide and 17.8 metres tall. The area of Building No. 1 is 5,575 m\u00b2, with a length of 76 metres, while Building No. 2 has a total area of 10,755 m\u00b2, and a length of 149 metres.Building No. 1 is regarded as a cultural facility, and is utilized as an event venue for art exhibitions, film festivals, musical competitions and plays. Building No. 2 houses a shopping mall and restaurant arcade, and a balcony from which visitors can view the harbour opened on the 3rd floor in 2007. Other sightseeing spots including Yokohama Chinatown, Minato Mirai 21, and Yamashita Park are located nearby.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nOn December 10, 2018, it was announced that the Final Stage of SASUKE 36's special would be broadcast live from the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse on TBS on New Year's Eve.  The 2019 edition of SASUKE's Final Stage will once again be broadcast live from the warehouse on December 31, 2019. It will be the 2nd consecutive SASUKE tournament to have a live Final Stage. \n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn with the Old: Yokohama's Red Brick Warehouses (in English)\nRed Brick Warehouse Yokohama - AsiaRooms.com (in English)\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouses, the building No.1 (in Japanese)\nThe Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse Official Homepage (in Japanese)",

          "There are repairs being made to an area of garden beds. But, despite this, all of the park remains open. The view is great as many vessels are moored or traversing the water. Buskers even are welcome but unobtrusive. In spring it would look even better.",

          "It is a lot better than what I imagined earlier. There is Christmas stalls around this area with a large crowd too, allowing everyone to enjoy a rather western atmosphere at Yokohama bay area. While the brick house itself is more like a shopping center, its outside is far more",

          "Had a great time browsing the many shops here. The winter market gave it a very christmassy feel. There was also an outdoor ice-skating area. We were there late and the kids were disappointed they could not skate. Do check out the timing if you are interested to skate. A",
          "There is a short walk from the Subway. It's a factory converted into many shops. There are all sorts of stores and excellent restaurants inside. Bring money. I had the best apple pie ever at the apple pie shop. You can sit outside also and have a drink and rest. It gets crowded",

          "The only problem is it doesn't open till late!! We were there at 9.30am and no shops were open! Some open at 10.30 and some at 11am. Very annoying for tourists! While some of the shops are different and sell craft, handmade things, not as many shops as I was expecting.",

          "Went to the \"red brick\" warehouse as it does have some historical significance, but currently it looks just like a harbour restaurant destination now (maybe it was being shown up by the October Festival next door). I've seen a lot of other red brick buildings, so this one",

          "Generally speaking Yokohama's shopping centers are more like the American kind than traditional Japanese mega department store kind. The Red Brock Warehouse, however, differs from both kinds. I would describe it as an upscale version of a flea market. The stores are generally",
          "This is a nice place to visit for a range of shopping and dining. We found the restaurants to be very busy when we visited (as was the whole of Yokohoma). It is worth a visit for something a bit different to the other shopping opportunities available.",
          "We were there on a Sunday when our cruise had a turnaround day in Yokohama. It was hot and crowded. After walking around a bit we just left the buildings and went back to our cabin on the ship. I think it would have been a romantic place to walk around when the weather is cooler",
          "We visted here in weekend and they had imported a heap of beautiful white sand from OZ for kids to play in while the adults had a drink. The whole place has been turned into cool shops and fancy places to eat. It's a good place to visit while walking around the Yokohama Port",

          "Interesting place by the sea. The shops inside these buildings are filled with hand crafted goodies and accessories as well as a few restaurants. Its nice to visit but not worth spending more than 2 hours unless you're eating at one of the delicious restaurants inside. More of a",
          "We first had lunch on the third floor which was quite good. After lunch we toured the Brickwork shops which were filled with Japanese knick knacks and arts and crafts. There was a little shop where everything is made from wood. All very beautiful but very expensive. There was",

          "Aka Renga (Red Brick Warehouse) is actually not too exciting on its own, but it is often the site of many festivals held in Yokohama. There's some pretty good food on site, at both the restaurant style and food court style areas. The shopping is a bit pricey, but the stores",
          "Yokohama is a laid back alternative to Tokyo. Red Brick Warehouse has easy access from the train, great views, and several dining choices. Great fun at night and (typically) interesting activities during the days on the weekends. GET OUT OF YOUR HOTEL ROOM!!!",
          "The place is really cool, it has trendy shops and cool restaurants, that are also good. It's close to the sea, so when in summer it's a nice place to refresh yourselves, plus some of the summer festivals are close to it. All in all, I\"ll say that it's worth a visit.",
          "I was expecting a real market type place with unusual things but it was mainly for homewares upstairs with food downstairs. It was raining so not that many people around. A highlight was a lovely Japanese salesgirl dressed up to the nines- very quirky- who was delighted to let",

          "It was raining so we went in here to escape the wet, but it was an interesting wander past some shops and restaurants and we stopped at one store to pick up some fun candies and local treats. Some of the restaurants had huge queues so I wouldn't go there if you were desperate",
          "There was the beer festival outside of the Red Brick Warehouse. It was not only beer, but the tent and a band which you would usually only find it in Germany during Octoberfest. Inside the red brick warehouse, there were many little shops about fashion and restaurants. They also",
          "Our cruise ship docked at Osanbashi Pier, from the open deck we saw two rolls of red brick buildings face to face standing together, and nothing happened there. Just some buildings that look like warehouse. In the early afternoon, when we walked by, the whole place was alive,",

          "it's huge! the variety of sea creatures there is huge! although i do feel the polar bear deserves a bigger compound or at least a companion... Don't miss the show it has seals, penguins, walruses and dolphins which perform tricks! the furreal lagoon is worth visiting, you get to",
          "Kind of disappointed. Travel all the way, expect to be big & good. The dolphin showcase is not bad,the aqua aquarium i which you can interact with the whale & dolphin are quite okay. The rides, not sure why when I am there, just a handful of people. Not worth.",

          "Easy way to go from Yokohama Station. Should try to visit the observation tower. High prices for buying softdrinks. Everything is nice!",
          "This may not be the best among Japan aquarium. It is one place need to revamp for further attraction. Very little range of sea creatures.",
          "Read the reviews, it's a nice place! What they don't say is that you can actually go there and not have to pay the entry fee into the park. The entire area which surrounds the Sea Paradise is a MEGA cool area full of shops for eating, drinking, shopping, attractions, places to",
          "The area around the park was very beautiful. As for the animals it was great to be able to see them but the park could invest in so much more for these animals if they are going to keep them in captivity. The Polar Bear and Whale Shark were sad to see as there is nothing even",
          "This summer, I had been to Sea Paradise with my family. It is a great place for me and family as a tourist to visit. I really liked how the place around it was neat and clean. It was also decorated with many trees and flowers. There were countless kinds of fish such as dolphins,",
          "First of all this is a good place to visit. The aquarium is really very good and dolphin show is fun to watch. There are lot of attraction and it takes almost full day to see them all. This park is a open entry park that means even if you are not buying a ticket you can go in.",
          "Its a great place in Tokyo and requires a whole day. There are two options- one you want to see sea life which has ticket and another one is free of cost and you can enjoy the sea. Recommended to people visiting Japan. You can reach there via monorail.",
          "Hakkeijima Sea Paradise is a good destination for people who seek to experience sea parks in more ways than one, as it has great shows, aquariums, rides, and plenty of dining options. The animals were well-trained, and those is closed confines didn't seem too deprived of space.",
          "Right by my house. One of two very decent, but not amazing amusement parks in Yokohama. I go there often. Good aquarium and a nice number of rides of all types on the fair. The surf coaster is great fun.",
          "The aquarium itself is incredible. There are lots of animals to see including a polar bear, box jellyfish, penguins, walruses, a whale shark and much more. The ticket to the aquarium includes one show featuring the dolphins, beluga whales, seals, walrus, and a pelican.",
          "I was surprised at how much this park has to offer. I was expecting a decent aquarium, but was pleasantly surprised that they had walruses, a polar bear, dolphins, a whale shark, ballou whales etc. The aquarium alone was very impressive. You could touch a seal, penguin, whales",
          "My wife, myself and my two sons (aged 1 and 5) visited here back in April. The park offers good value for money. We were able to purchase premium tickets which gave us access to the various different areas of the park (Dolphins, rides, a sealife show, sealife centre etc) Our",
          "Has a few attractions to see. Dolphin show is the best yet. Has a few other small shows to view as well.",
          "There were many animals on exhibit showing off the animals in their natural habitats as much as possible. We watched the marine animals show which was awesome!! The dolphins really know how to show off their talents!! A must visit if you are visiting Yokohama. The view there is",
          "We went to Sea Paradise recently and to be truthful it wasn't the best aquarium we've ever been to. It's pretty naff really and some of the creatures are in very small spaces - especially the whale shark. It's typically Japanese naffness. We might be comparing unfairly though",
          "We didn't do the amusement park but the aqua museum and the marine show had a great diversity of marine life and were well-presented. I did wonder if the habitat could have been better for the larger animals like the whale sharks and the belugas but it is a very accessible,",
          "We only made it to the aquarium. My kids LOVED it. It was pretty pricy, but we expect to pay more for animals that are happy and treated right. We went through early afternoon, ate at the food court then went in again. Second time around the animals were more active. Fun",
          "First of all, it is not free. There are options. If you don't have a child with you, not all of them are for you. Go through side and decide what you want to see. Only the show including the museum takes two hours and you really get tired.",
          "This place is half aquarium and half amusement park. You can opt to buy tickets for both or just the aquarium. You can ask for the English map when purchasing the ticket. They have daily shows, and timing is at the entrance. We watched the dolphin show, was entertaining.",
          "This place is great if you're going to stay the whole day. You need to check the schedule of shows and animal interaction time and most of them are in the afternoon. I only bought a ticket for the exhibits for 3k and didnt really made the whole worth of it because I need to",
          "Take the metro to Hakkeijima on the Seaside line and make the ten-minute, scenic, cross-bridge walk to Sea Paradise. The Aquarium is located inside a free-range amusement park-type environment where you can pay for rides (some are a little creepily rickety). Buy your tickets",
          "It was nice experience to visit this place. It is an island having sea paradise, amusement parks, fishing exercises. Best thing to experience was a dolphin show. It was truly amazing.",
          "Amazing park with aquarium and funfair. The aquarium was brilliant. My kids loved the amusement rides especially the Blue Fall. I was even persuaded onto the rollercoaster which was seriously scary, looping over water. I'm not keen on animals performing for human's",
          "Dolphins, Amusement, Food entertainment. A perfect place for family outing as well as bachelors outing.",
          "We took a side trip to SEA PARADISE and it is definitely worth it. We took our twin toddlers. For some reason my son really wanted to see a whale shark and we found out this place is only one or two in the world that has one in captivity. And he also loves beluga whales and",
          "While this attraction has amusement rides we only went to the Aquarium part. It has a series of exhibits in different buildings and thanks to lack of Japanese we bought tickets for everything. The total ticket was expensive and we really didn't need the catch your own fish and",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Hakkeijimi. It is a short ride by train from Yokohama. There is no entrance fee and you can decide what you want to visit. There are different kinds of tickets available decide on what to want to get the best deal. We got a four parter for the Aqua",
          "Well connected by train from Hakkejima. Language is a problem in Japan if you dont know Japanese but we somehow managed. There were 4 of us and we took 3500 Yen tickets each. That includes single pass on all rides, entry to all the aquariums. The place is amazing. We visited in",
          "Visited Sea Paradice in April and had a great day. Lots to see, but the highlight was the show. Heated outdoor seats were a treat on a cold day and the show was fantastic with lots to see.",
          "This aquarium is a wonderful place. There are fish in amazing aquariums. My favorite is a Japanese mamba or sunfish. Please visit here.",
          "no fee for entrance, pay only for what you do. all attractions are strongly recommended. aquarium is great and creatures are nicely trained.",
          "Superb place if you want to see the sea mammals show. It is organized in a very good manner. They have trained the mammals so efficiently that they behave as if they are human being and not mammals :) Roller coaster ride, free fall are the attractions which one should not miss!",
          "Perfect leisure place In my view, I absolutely recommend you to go the Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise which is the fabulous leisure place to enjoy. First of all, there is amusement park, aquarium and restaurant in the site of Sea Paradice and surrounded",
          "Once in the life time that you can enjoy watching plenty of sea animals without sailing into the deep sea, come to sea paradise. You can see lots of sea living things here which you may not be able to see it somewhere else, like polar bear, sea lion, whale shark, beluga whale,",
          "The sea paradise is one of the well maintained weekend destinations. The rides were superb especially the roller coaster and free fall. If you have kids they will enjoy a lot. If you are planning to spend a full day better to take a full day pass They showed a film which you",
          "Beautiful open spaces and picnic areas that are open to public free of charge. The aquariums are really wonderful and everyone would love it, kids or adults alike. As for the rides, the roller coaster is okay and the blue fall is good and the tower is good especially for its",
          "It has aquarium, sea mammal show and many more water rides. There are any rides for kids as well, a train to travel inside the sea paradise it's a bit expensive(300 yen/person) the bus is more cheap(100 yen/person). There are breath taking rides for adults as well. My 3 year old",
          "There is so much to do in this wonderful place. An amusement park and a Grand Carousel will greet you as you go your way to the ticket booths. They have a wonderful dolphin, sea lions and whale shark show which will surely leave a smile on your face. A very impressive collection",
          "We made the mistake of getting the 5,050 yen full park pass on a day that was so hot that we stayed in the aquariums. Admission for just the aquariums would have been just 3,000 yen. Full park drops to 3,300 yen for the evening when it makes more sense in August. Neat thing",
          "One of the best attraction near Tokyo that I went last time in Japan. The park consists in several different events: A big and nice aquarium An amusement park area (wasn't what we were looking for, so I don't remember very well how was that) A fishing area, where you can get",
          "Dad and I got there a little late and actually got the Night pass for couples for just the Aqua resort. The resort was actually split into 4 sections, and we visited 3 areas and skipped the Umi Farm, which was too dark to see anything. The dolphin tunnel also houses the huge",
          "Interesting part of this aquarium is that it is on an island that is kind of a theme park type deal. However, it's a pay as you go kind of thing. You can however pay for a wrist band for the day to get into the aquarium as ride all the rides. Though the rides themselves",
          "Only spent half a day at the Aquarium and not the rides there, but it was still absolutely fantastic. Seeing the whale shark upclose along with the great collection of marine life, it was a very satisfying and enjoyable trip. Also do make your way to the show early to get a",
          "We really enjoyed our multiple visits to Sea Paradise. The aquariums are great for the kids and adults alike. We bought the bracelet for the rides and it was worth it, but if you are only going to ride a few rides then just pay individually. The line for the coaster was",
          "I really enjoyed my trip to the aquarium. When we went on a weekday, it was not busy at all. I only wish we had allowed more time on the island. We did not walk around the park area, but we did see the main aquarium, the dolphin show and the hands on marine area. They also had",
          "I was there in Hakkejima Sea Park they have beautifull park there. When night is come i saw the LED Light's and i was suprised. Because They haved a strong light and that was awesome when i saw at. I like The Dolphin Show because they have so much funny's humor and i like the",
          "We went here after reading the reviews. You can easily spend several hours here with the kids and that is without even going to the rides. The shows were great and we even got to pat a beluga whale! The are two types of entry fee - one with the aquarium stuff and one that",
          "Theres a massive tank with a whale shark and an amazing show, best live sea show Ive ever seen featuring dolphins, walruses, seals, belugas and more. I was so impressed by this place, you pay around $50AUD and get to experience the main aquarium, and three other smaller",
          "I love this place. Not only you can enjoy a spectacular collection of sea animals especially the huge ones, the place is very educational too. The Umi farm is a must to try. It was my first time to fish and I really enjoyed it. We also loved the live show and the chance to touch",
          "Very nice park with plenty to do. We went on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowds and it was very pleasant. Took in the aquarium as well as the aqua show which was very entertaining -- even the seats were heated! Admission is a bit expensive, but probably not any more so",
          "Okay. That IS the best aquarium I have ever seen and believe me not the only one I've seen. Even though it is quite far from Tokyo and Yokohama, and finding my way there has puzzled me a bit it was well worth it! I won't go through all the details and everything you will see",
          "This is a place where they have aquariums and other attractions. A place where kids can have fun all day, located near the beach. You can also shop and eat here, a full day of fun!",
          "I think I am quite proud of our Ocean Park in Hong Kong. It has nearly all facillites similar to Hakkeijima except the Polar Bear. However, it is a worthy experience to enjoy playing with the sea lion in the snowy weather.",
          "We came exclusively for the aquarium portion, although there is a small amusement park included in the complex. The small tanks inside had good displays of the various specimens and kept the kids very engaged. The whale sharks were a big hit - I have to admit I was excited to",
          "I was disgusted to see that a beluga whale had been trained to paint pictures for visitors - these beautiful animals should be in the wild not captive in a small tank I dread to think how they trained it to do this if you have any compassion towards animals you will avoid this",
          "It was very cold the day we went and not much was happening in the theme park attached but the aquarium was still worth the visit. The highlight of the day was the performance using the walrus, seals and dolphins, which although was totally in Japanese was understandable and",
          "Quite a slog from central Tokyo this \u201camusement park/aquarium complex\u201d outside Yokohama is a great day out. We concentrated on the aquarium bit and did not visit the amusement park area at all. You can get a pass to see all parts of the Aquarium and unfortunately we did not",
          "Went to the seaside aquarium on December 8, 2013. Took about an hour each way from Shinjuku to Hakkeijima. Train ride was not too complicated. Just follow the access map in the website: http://www.seaparadise.co.jp/english/ (Be sure to print out discount voucher from the web",
          "highly recommended if you are visiting Japan. Lots of animals to touch for free. others aquarium might charges for petting the dophin but here is free. The performance is great. There even have a place for you to catch fish which they will fried for you later but you need to",
          "W loed this day out, the only bad thing was that once you've bought your main tickets you still find yourself paying extra for some things, such as paying for rods and bait to catch your own fish (plenty of biters, so much fun) and then paying again for each fish when you take",

          "We visited this place when it rained, too bad. Not much outdoor activities we could do. However, we really enjoyed the mammals show. The animals are really well trained and could entertain you that much, you cannot miss this one. The rest attractions/activities were just fine,",
          "This was a very enjoyable last minute idea. Loved the aquatic show. Not sure about the comment about the animals being sad ad treated poorly, that's not what we saw. We didn't wait in line that long for the rides either. We also got to see the Yokohama High Drum and Bugle Corps",
          "Paid to see cruelty. The animals are sad looking in small tanks and cages. The dolphins had sores (possibly because there is not enough space for them to swim and play!). I left the with tears in my eyes :-( Surely some kids look fascinated to see the animals, but I would never",
          "I was staying in Tokyo and was recommended to go here to take the kids. It actually was a turned out to be an excellent day trip from Tokyo. The aquarium was among the best I have been to and they had an amazing aqua show when they turn on the special effect lights and feed the",

          "I love aquariums cause I love animals and so this was an easy 5/5. I unfortunately went on a day it was raining and had started to get sick on the train rides there, but even that didn't damper my spirits too much. It wasn't crowded at all but that may have been because I went",
          "My family and I got to Yokohama Sea paradise around 2pm or 3pm and we were able to catch the aqua show which was AWESOME!!! I couldn't believe how entertaining it was!!!! The aquatic animals were just too adorable and it was so nice that they had a variety of performing animals",
          "The aquarium was amazing, and if you can catch the live show, do so! The polar bear and penguins looked really sad and mopey, but the other marine animals were spritely. The smaller exhibits around the main aquarium are interesting too, but the highlight for me (and the little",

          "A resonable day out with the family, but a let down when you compare it to Sea World. Japan zoo and animal parks tend to have small enclosures which are very sad looking at the animals in them. In summer it is extremely hot and sunny with no real shade options for the outdoor",

        "wiki": "Yokohama (Japanese: \u6a2a\u6d5c, pronounced [jokohama] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Japan by population, and the most populous municipality of Japan. It is the capital city of Kanagawa Prefecture. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kant\u014d region of the main island of Honshu. It is a major commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area.\nYokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nYokohama (\u6a2a\u6d5c) literally means \"horizontal beach\". The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the \u014coka River and the Nakamura River had been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a \"horizontal beach\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening of the Treaty Port (1859\u20131868) ===\nYokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners. A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853\u201354, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.It was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the bustling town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the T\u014dkaid\u014d for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.Yokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English speaking residents as The Bluff.\nKannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, inside the barrier), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound.  Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.\nTo protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city. Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan's first English language newspaper, the Japan Herald published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream and beer to be produced in Japan.  Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863 and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866 and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly \u2013 attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji and Taisho Periods (1868\u20131923) ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan's first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan's first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel Around the World in Eighty Days, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.\nIn 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city's first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal-burning plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889. By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.\nThe early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Great Kanto earthquake and the Second World War (1923\u20131945) ===\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923 by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170. Fuelled by rumours of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum. Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake.

          "The Shinyokohama Ramen Museum has changed dramatically. Yes, if I look at my previous (quite negative) review for this place and I look at the museum right now, I can say that it is finally a museum. Apparently the changes occurred about a year or so ago. They are still working",

          "I would not really consider this a museum but more of a fancy area with different ramen shops of different noodle and soup type. For about 600 Yen, you get a small bowl (which is frankly not very small), so you can\u2019t really try many different ramen. On the first level, there are",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here! Great good, friendly staff, and great decor! Word of advise though - some of their souvenirs are over priced. I paid 300 yen for something I have found at several locations now for 150...but that's to be expected at places like this.",

          "Here are my two cents. Overall, the place was easy to navigate and the ordering machines made it quick and painless to select what you want. Most places don\u2019t have much extra toppings to add but they do have a couple of different ramen dishes to choose from. Most importantly,",
          "Definitely the best Hakata lamen in Kanto area! If in Yokohama it\u2019s a must to visit place and Hakata lamen a must to try!",
          "What a fun place to visit. The museum takes you from the earliest AD times to present day times of Ramen. The most fun is to go to the restaurants downstairs where you can enjoy various ramen dishes with authentic movie scene type restaurants.",
          "I visit this museum because I am a ramen lover. I learn the history of ramen in Japan. The food court is kinda cool. I feel like I went back to the old days. We enjoyed the ramen there!",
          "We were looking for the Yokohama Cup Noodle Museum but since we were out of time already, we tried this museum instead which was just a walking distance from our hotel. The small museum was devoted to the history of RAUMEN in Japan. Surprisingly, it wasn't just a simple museum",
          "IF your in Japan and don't go then your an idiot, the museum is amazing and it's the first food museum I have personally visited anywhere in the world and it's a must. Entrance fee is minimal at 300 yen and well worth paying to help keep this place running. It is spread out",
          "We wend yesterday on a field trip And it's was outstanding experience full of allot of I formation about instant ramen and my favorite was the time of creating your own ramen it was super fun and I highly recommend it to everyone",

          "Okay, so the thing about the ramen museum is that it\u2019s all about your expectations. Despite the name, this is not a museum. There\u2019s a small interactive exhibit describing the types of ramen common to each part of Japan, and there\u2019s a gift shop with all the whimsical ramen",
          "As I live nearby the ramen museum, I usually will pay a visit after a month or two. I was quite sad to find the ramen from Kumamoto is gone. The other one from Hokkaido, sumire was also shut. It was quite a shock as both these shops are my favorite. The long standing stall is",
          "TL;DR The museum is small and rubbish. The ramen is average. They shouldn't charge you if you want to just eat the ramen. The place is out of the way and we had trouble getting there. Not really worth the trip unless you are local to it.",
          "Since i am impatient and didnt want to wait in long lines we went to a sweet little soda shop and had ice cream, french fries and a drink. So good",
          "I was not really excited about coming to the ramen museum because really, who cares about ramen THAT much. I was pleasantly surprised by the information about ramen on the first floor and then the opportunity to try different kinds in the lower level. Sure, there's lots of",
          "We were kinda disappointed that there is actually nothing much in this ramen museum. So much that we completed the visit within 15 mins and left empty handed",
          "This \u201cmuseum\u201d is more like a traditional re-build of several ramen restaurants. They have vegetarian ramen as well which is difficult to find in Japan. This place is similar to the ramen stadium in Fukuoka but with entrance fee and more traditional looking. The museum part is",
          "The inside is a store and a brief display of ramen. What they do have is they show you how umami is made. You get to sample two different ty pes of broth. Delicious. Downstairs they have created small streets with different resturants that specialize in different types of",
          "Thought this place would give me the opportunity to try out different types of Ramen. However each Ramen shop forces you to buy a bowl of Ramen per adult (these are full size and start from 900-1000 Yen). So the most you would be able to eat is 2/3 out of the 9 places. They need",
          "The interior of the place is amazing, made to look like a 60s market place with each ramen shop running as a stall. This is the perfect place to try the best ramen from all parts of Japan in 1 place. I went with a group of friends and we each ordered different ramens and the",
          "This is less a museum and more a food court with a cover charge. That said it is still fun. The street level has souvenirs and info on the history of ramen in Japan. The restaurants/ themed areas are below street level. Each restaurant serves a regional ramen and has a kiosk",
          "The place is made as a Showa period Japanese neighborhood. There are several ramen shops inside. most of them serves half portion so one can try several shops.",
          "Only one place to learn about ramen; only one place to eat all kinds of ramen; only one place to see everything about ramen; only at Sino-Yokohama Ramen Museum can I do everything. It was a nice day for a train ride out to Yokohama from Shinjuku. On the first floor they had a",
          "Great experience. You get to briefly learn about the history of ramen and then start eating it. We went for the tonkatsu ramen on the lower level. I could totally see this becoming a food challenge. Like if you planned out to spend several days in Yokohama, then you can",
          "The sign saying that each adult is expected to order at least one bowl of ramen was a little confusing (we already had a good tuck in at Hoshinos and did not buy any food from the Museum) Was a little disappointed when we stepped in after paying the entrance fee, it looked as",
          "I love ramen but sadly I didn't have enough time here to savour more than one shop. I made the mistake of going here on a Sunday afternoon, at the worst possible time (not only because it was a Sunday but also a public holiday weekend) and with a Shinkansen to catch in about 2.5",
          "You need a reason to go to shin Yokohama. there\u2019s not much there but for ramen fans the museum offers an interesting two hours. The museum itself is small and offers a modest introduction to the history of this uniquely Japanese noodle. The souvenir shop to the side offers a",
          "Love this spot! When I went I was confused about how to order a half portion of ramen, and ended up eating a giant bowl of the most delicious ramen I have ever eaten. Lots of vegetarian options as well as types of ramen from different regions. Cute little basement area--there",
          "I would highly suggest going mid afternoon on a weekday which is what i did (on a Tuesday) and the majority of the ramen shops were near empty. The learning bit which is a timeline of the Chinese noodle influences to present day global ramen is on the first floor right near the",
          "I had to go to the ramen museum. I love ramen. There is a lot of variations of ramen in Japan and this is the place yo try em all, if can. I only had 2 bowls ramen cause they are so filling. Lines long so you will be there for 2ish hours. Didnt want to spend more hours there",
          "I\u2019d been previously told that you could try small bowls of ramen at this museum and perhaps it\u2019s the restaurant I chose, but it was a large bowl of ramen. Although too full to try other ramens, there are many to choose from! Very fun place to checkout if in Yokohama!",
          "I went with a tour group and they let us have it as our dinner place. It is a very interesting place as there is lots of shops in a small area. There were a few people but I can see if they are busy there wouldn't be room to walk. We found a place but not sure how to order as",
          "My daughter and I visited this ramen museum at Shin-Yokohama last May. There are selected top ramen shops from all over Japan downstairs, but you have to be really patient for the long que to buy the ramen you want. If you don't want to que, you can actualy but instant ramen at",
          "Ramen museum is interesting collection of ramen shops all in one location. The ship we chose was good and ramen very tasty. Don\u2019t forget to stop by gift shop for interesting snacks. We enjoyed the samples of ramen crackers and bought a box to take home for souvenir to share",
          "Had a headache because there was too many ramen restaurants to choose from. The musuem had a theme of the streets and houses of Shitamachi. It was not very crowded when we got there. You have to pay a fee to enter the musuem. It is a short walk from the nearest train station.",
          "Be prepared to wait outside your selected Ramen shop but the queues move fairly quickly. The ticket machine had a laminated sheet in English on the side to help you negotiate the options. You can order a half size which meant I could taste more than one type. In one word they",

          "Actually I don't really understand why they call this place as museum. The museum was so small! But the best part was the amusement park in the B1 and B2. It's like a city of ramen where you can taste authentic Japanese ramen from all over Japan. The decoration was so great so",
          "This place was puzzling when you enter because you are confronted by a large Scalextric circuit, which has nothing to do with noodles, and a rather meaningless shop. When you descend the stairs, however, it all comes to life. This two storey edifice is a recreation of Tokyo",
          "Not an easy place to find. Walk in and was amaze by this \"underground\" city. Old Japan and being from Singapore, I was fascinated by it because one of the store was actually selling candies and toys that I played while growing up. The ramen was really wonderful. The wait",
          "This is an inexpensive and fun way to both sight-see and eat at an interesting place! I always make sure to bring friends, family and colleagues here when I show them around Yokohama. It's like Disneyland, but for ramen, and without the rides. They also sell old candies and",
          "Nice concept (Noodles from different areas of Japan). We visited Museum during Japanese holiday, and it was very crowded. However had good time.",
          "Little tricky to find, but using the google maps street view helps a lot! Make sure you reserve plenty of time for this place. It is not a museum in its traditional form, such as lots of reading and seeing. It is a museum of tastes. You eat your way through this one. On",
          "Our family didn't have to travel very far to visit this place but we did make a special trip and it was hard to find and not really worth it. What some reviewers have called the \"food court\" is actually a collection of individual storefronts of ramen shops from all over Japan",
          "It's a bit hard to find (we had to ask for directions from some locals and even then, ended up going around in a circle before arriving at the correct location.) After paying to enter, we received some brochures in English. There are 3 floors. The top floor, where the entrance",

          "Bit hard to find the place you have to ask for direction but all the people there are very helpful. When you arrive fell that you back to the past.. very interesting decorations. old japan You have to explore every corner before you decide where to eat . Good ramen if you can",
          "If you're coming from the other part of the world and want to try good ramen, then this is the place! To be honest, I have eaten a lot of ramen in the past and the ramen you'll experience in this place is not to be fascinated about, but it's the taste of ramen that will come",
          "The museum is worth the 300 yen admission price. The bottom floor is a beautifully immersive environment that transports you to another place and time. The ramen itself, however, is quite average and nothing to write home about. You can find ramen that is leaps and bounds better",
          "We love Ramen noodles so this pilgrimage was an important part of our travel in Japan. Unless you are traveling by Shinkansen, Shin-Yokohama is not that convenient to get to. Then if you are not using then subway, to walk to the museum, you must first get to the subway level and",
          "There is a fee to enter, but that is about the only thing similar to being a museum. There is a little food market, and slot car race track (didn't really make sense), and a food court with ramen restaurants. I definitely wouldn't suggest going if you weren't going to visit",
          "Having read about this museum, I had actually saved a half day to visit it during my stay in Tokyo Despite the positive reviews, it wasn't as grand as I expected it to be. First of all, the museum is not a museum, the term \"Ramen Food Court\" would be a little more accurate.",
          "The museum is actually a food amusement park located in ShinYokohama. The museum highlights the Japanese ramen noodle soup. Within the museum are branches of famous ramen restaurants from Kyushu to Hokkaido. There is also a souvenir shop selling ramen bowls, cooking utilities",
          "We enjoyed performance and kids bought some balloon from the small sweet shop and they love it. Hope parking fee gets much cheaper. I went several shop to taste Ramen but over all, Ikemen was the best.",

          "You pay to enter this place and then you pay again to enjoy the ramen. There is no exhibit involved in this museum, this is essentially a food court of supposedly great ramen around Japan (and including one from the USA). Also as I was travelling with my partner, we can't each",
          "The admission charge (~$3 per adult) is likely for paying performers - which add to the entertainment value of the visit but completely unrelated to anything ramen. Great detail has been paid to the recreation of what a small city block looked like several decades ago.",
          "This \u201cMuseum\u201d is not about art or historical items displayed in cases, it is a place where you can experience ramen culture by eating samples from some of the most popular shops across the country. The ground floor has a corner showing how the type of ramen differs across",
          "It felt like we were just paying some yen to enter a themed food court that sells various types of ramen! Nothing much about ramen to learn about. I wouldn't even call this a \"museum\". We tried the Hollywood Ramen restaurant - the fusion ramen was interesting but not very",
          "I visited this place a number of times. I make a stop whenever I am in Japan. I love one of the ramen store - Ryu Shanghai. The absolute best in the world in my opinion. The place is small but thy make it up to be an old Japanese street. A must visit if you are a ramen lover",
          "Essentially, this is a mall or food court with a few differences: The interior is pre-war Japan with a few modern touches. It hosts a few of the best Ramen restaurants from all over Japan. Lastly, you have to pay an entrance fee. Unless you are Ramen-mad and you need to taste",
          "Just in walking distance from shin yokohama station. Limousine bus from airport available. Easy to go. A building with old japan theme. Like going there for a meal with ramen option lol One good point is.... due to it is tourist attraction, \u02daVegetarian menu and no pork menu",
          "It was a very nice surprise to go to this place! It is a unique location for Ramen lovers! There is a interesting store at the street level with everything for ramen and then downstairs, there are many ramen restaurants, in a incredible atmosphere. All of them were full with big",
          "The museum is interesting. It's close to ShinYokohama station within walking distance. There's a nominal fee but you can usually get a discount from the hotel you're saying at nearby if you ask the reception. Once inside, you learn about different ramen from various regions.",
          "When you enter the museum, you are greeted with a room selling items related to Ramen and the like. The real deal is the floor below where they have (re)created 1960s Japan complete with street performers and several restaurants serving a variety of ramen. Interesting and",
          "ramen is kind of the symbol of japan and also one of my favorite food. Frankly speaking,brand in this building is not better than others I found in yokohama or tokyo, but what I saw is more than eating. Museum make the street just like the way they look like in",
          "One of the best place if you are big Ramen fan. Very easy get to if you stay in Tokyo. Location is very close to Shin Yokohama station walking distance. Ramen Museum invite only the best Ramen restaurant across Japan. They have many different type of soup base Ramen that you can",
          "Honestly, not worth the trip as you'll find much better ramen restaurants elsewhere in Yokohama/Tokyo. However, if you're into the 1950s d\u00e9cor, which many people do love, and your time is limited and you want a couple half servings to try different types, certainly go for it.",
          "The Ramen Museum is a \"must-visit\" EVERY time I come to Japan. One tip: Never, ever come on a Saturday or Sunday. (It gets way too crowded.) I usually buy a 3-month pass, which is like only 300 yen ($3) more than a one-day pass. Going down to the lower floors, you'll step back",
          "Ramen was born in Yokohama; the place can get pretty crowded on weekends but it's a must-try for ramen fans. Various styles of ramen from around Japan are represented, and the decor represents the heyday of Yokohama with its artisan building facades from the war era. You can",
          "The museum is very small and basic, more of a way to pass time as you decide what style ramen you want and then stand in line for a hour. Yes, the are where the shops are located are cool, but it was al,out \u00a51000 just for a small bowl of ramen!",
          "If you want to sample a variety of different ramen from various regions in Japan, then you need to take a trip out to Ramen Museum. By bullet train, (Shinkansen), you can reach here (shin-yokohama stop) in 15 min from Tokyo- quick!!! Then a 10 min walk and you are there. If",
          "Visiting a friend in Yokohama, we'd read about this museum so she took us there to check it out. What I liked: the old-time street reconstruction, the old time candy & novelty shop, eating ramen, and that's about it. What I didn't like: crowds of kids and families in the",
          "I don't feel that this can pass as a museum. It has some ramen stalls. A little 50-ish display. That's it. I would like to really really see how ramen is made. This is too small to do all that. Granted, being Japanese means everything is done nicely. Just not informative, in",
          "The ramen museum is one destination that I always looking forward to going to again. Entering the museum is an experience in time travel, going back decades to old time Tokyo. There are several freshly made ramen vendors. The selection and ordering process can be a bit",
          "Museum part is tiny but go downstairs and you enter a different era. Has a '50's feel to it which makes it look like a small town from that time. Very detailed. Lots of Ramen to eat.",
          "It is called the ramen musuem, but the musuem portion is a small section of the gift shop. I don't think anyone lingers on the first floor too long. The second floor is a reproduction of a Showa era town which has little ramen shops sprinkled about. It is beautiful and",
          "There is a musuem upstairs that is pretty boring and unimportant. The real attraction is downstairs, where they have recreated a small meiji-period shitamachi (downtown), where almost every shop is a ramen restaurant. All of the shops have different kinds of ramen - shoyu,",
          "While others have reviewed locations, story behind it, the plus minus.. I just want to tell that if you visit it, you have to try shio ramen from stall 8 (Shinasoba-ya). In the map, stall 8 mentioned as shoyu ramen based - yokohama style but they did shio ramen as well.. And",
          "I didn't really pay attention to the museum upstairs. The replica of an entire 1950's Yokohama city block downstairs is where the money's at. This place is awesome. It's a period of Japan that my grandfather spoke of, but one I would never get to see... Until I found out about",

          "The Ramen museum is essentially a giant food court, designed to replicate post-WWII 1958 Japan. Maybe I was expecting a little too much from a ramen \"museum\", such as basic / preliminary descriptions about how ramen is cooked, which was nowhere to be found other than the",
          "This \"museum\" collects some of Japans best ramen shops under one roof for you to pick. Prices for the ramen are a tad high, and there is an admission fee but you get the atmosphere and selection of whatever ramen you want from all over Japan. Place can be a zoo when it is",
          "This is really more of a theme restaurant than a museum, but it is awesome. Patrons can go to a number of mini-restaurants and try ramen noodles from different regions. At each outlet, purchase a ticket from the vending machine outside the door and wait for your table. The",
          "Lovely 'museum' that transports you to 1958 Japan, just before the invention of instant noodle which revolutionalised the eating of ramen. The main aim of the museum is to taste ramen from different reason. You can visit the various ramen shops, each representing a different",
          "The ramen I tried was good, but the whole experience was very annoying to me. First, on the website, they say that it is expected that each adult will buy a bowl of ramen. So I think, who goes to the ramen museum without buying ramen? No problem. BUT you have to buy a bowl",
          "Actual name is Shinyokohama Raumen Museum. From the Yokohama JR Station take the JR Yokohama Line or the Yokohama Subway line to Shin-Yokohama Station. Walk about 5 minutes to the museum. Get good directions in English at the Tourist Information desk in the Yokohama Station.",
          "One of the main reasons this author traveled to Yokohama, Japan was to visit the Ramen Noodle Museum. Walk about 2 blocks from the hotel to get there then pay a $3 entry fee and go back in time to 1954 when ramen noodles were invented. With this bygone era as the theme, you can",
          "Took my family on a short shinkansen ride from tokyo to yokohama. We went to the ramen museum for late lunch. You have to pay the entrance fee to go in (250 yen for adults, be sure to google its website for discount entrance coupon). My son enjoy the electric car racing track",
          "First off, some expectation management: you should not go here expecting an education the way you would with a normal museum. This place is first and foremost a specialist gourmet food court, with amazing decor. I read Japanese, but even then the only \"museum-y\" thing there was",
          "To get to the Ramen Museum, you must take the train to Shin Yokohama on the outskirts of Yokohama city. Once there, you must pay 300 yen to enter the museum, which is mostly a food court - There's a limited exhibition on the history of ramen, but it's only in Japanese. All the",
          "I love ramen. So very very much. Last time I was planning to visit Japan, I flew into Tokyo and headed immediately to a hotel in Yokohama, so I figured a rejuvenating bowl of ramen wouldn't quite be enough after my flight. No, I needed an entire MUSEUM devoted to what they",
          "Unlike the Cup Ramen Museum, this Yokohama Raumen Museum is packed with people on our visit. Furthermore, there's a lack of translation on the exhibit floor, so basically it's not tourist friendly. It's a Museum/Collective of great ramen restaurants sitting below (yes, it's",
          "I hugely enjoyed my visit - ok, so exhibit is not much but what they have is interesting. Best part for me was making my own pot noodle! You get to draw your own design, then choose soup, and 4 ingredients. They'll shrink wrap it for you to take home. Genius!",
          "My husband and I went to the Ramen Museum around lunchtime on a Friday. There is a small entrance fee to get in, and there's an annual pass that can be purchased for just a little more. The upper floor is a gift shop as well as a nice timeline of ramen. I really wish they had",

Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nThe area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.\nMinato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at \u014csanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMajor attractions in the area include:\n\nYokohama Landmark Tower - the second-tallest building and fourth-tallest structure in Japan, with sweeping views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji\nCosmo World amusement park \u2014 includes the 100-metre (328 ft) tall Cosmo Clock 21, formerly the world's tallest Ferris wheel\nKishamichi Promenade - a pedestrian walkway that follows the original harbor railroad tracks, linking Sakuragich\u014d Station with Yokohama World Porters and the Cosmo Clock, and offering expansive views of the Minato Mirai skyline\nMinato Mirai Hall - concert hall home to the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra\nPacifico Yokohama\nNippon Maru - a four masted sailing ship, permanently docked on the harbor at Minato Mirai as a museum\nYokohama Museum of Art\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nQueen's Square Yokohama (Official website)\n\n\n== Major hotels ==\nMajor hotels in the area with over 300 guestrooms include:\n\nYokohama Bay Grand InterContinental Hotel\nPan Pacific Yokohama Bay Hotel Tokyu\nYokohama Royal Park Hotel\nYokohama Sakuragicho Washington Hotel\nYokohama Bay Sheraton Hotel and towers\n\n\n== Railway stations ==\nMinatomirai Station\nSakuragich\u014d Station\nShin-Takashima Station\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

Until surpassed by Abeno Harukas in 2012, it stood as the tallest building in Japan. It is located in the Minato Mirai 21 district of Yokohama city, next to the Yokohama Museum of Art.The building contains a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49\u201370, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. The building contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite corners of the building.On the 69th floor there is an observatory, Sky Garden, from which one can see a 360-degree view of the city, and on clear days Mount Fuji.The tower contains what were at their inauguration the world's second fastest elevators (installed by Mitsubishi Electric), which reach speeds of 12.5 m/s (41 ft/s) (45.0 km/h (28.0 mph)). This speed allows the elevator to reach the 69th floor in approximately 40 seconds. The elevators' speed record was surpassed by elevators of Taipei 101 (60.6 km/h, 37.7 mi/h) in 2004.\nThe building was designed by the architecture and engineering division of Mitsubishi Estate, now Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei and Hugh Stubbins and Associates, later KlingStubbins.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of tallest buildings in Japan\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest freestanding steel structures\nList of records of Japan\nList of public observation decks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Landmark Tower official site\n Geographic data related to Yokohama Landmark Tower at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Hikawa Maru (\u6c37\u5ddd\u4e38) is a Japanese ocean liner that Yokohama Dock Company built for Nippon Y\u016bsen Kabushiki Kaisha (\"NYK Line\"). She was launched on 30 September 1929 and made her maiden voyage from Kobe to Seattle on 13 May 1930. She is permanently berthed as a museum ship at Yamashita Park, Naka-ku, Yokohama.\nHikawa Maru was one of three Hikawa Maru class motor ships, all named after major Shinto shrines. The Hikawa Shrine is in Saitama in central Honshu. Her two sister ships, both lost in the Second World War, were Heian Maru and Hie Maru.\n\n\n== Civilian service ==\n\nHikawa Maru and her sisters ran a regular liner route between Yokohama, Vancouver and Seattle. She had a reputation for service that combined splendid food and beautiful art deco interiors, and she was nicknamed \"The Queen of the Pacific\". Charlie Chaplin travelled on her for part of the round the World tour that he made in 1932. Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d, the founder of Judo and Japan's representative on the International Olympic Committee, died whilst aboard in 1938.In 1940\u201341, before Japan's entry to the Second World War, hundreds of Jewish refugees from Nazi persecution fled to Canada and the USA via Japan, and many of them sailed on Hikawa Maru. In August 1940 a party of 82 German and Lithuanian Jews who had travelled via the USSR and Vladivostok reached Seattle on Hikawa Maru. Later, Rabbi Zerach Warhaftig and his family travelled east from Lithuania to Japan. They left Yokohama on Hikawa Maru on 5 June 1941 and landed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 17 June. He described the trip as \"a summer vacation and with the war seeming to be so far away\" although, he said \"I didn't have a peaceful mind because of the strong responsibility I had to help the Jewish refugees with the troubles they faced.\"In July 1941 the US and other countries retaliating against Japan's invasion of French Indochina ordered the seizure of Japanese assets. However, the USA gave assurances that the liners would not be seized so Heian Maru and Hikawa Maru continued their regular service to US ports. In October 1941 Hikawa Maru became the last NYK ship to visit a US port before Japan and the US went to war. She brought US refugees to Seattle, and on her return voyage she repatriated 400 Japanese nationals.\n\n\n== Wartime hospital ship ==\n\nOn 1 December 1941, a week before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Mitsubishi Zosen dockyard at Yokohama started to convert Hikawa Maru into a hospital ship, completing work on her on 21 December. She treated Japanese casualties from the US Task Force 8's attacks on Kwajalein and Wotje atolls in February 1942 and repatriated the seriously wounded to Yokosuka. On 15 June 1942 the Japanese cruiser Nagara brought about 500 Japanese wounded from the Battle of Midway to Hashirajima, where they were transferred to Hikawa Maru.Three times Hikawa Maru survived being damaged by mines. The first was on 3 October 1942 while entering port at Surabaya, Java. She was repaired in port and departed on 10 October. The second was on 15 July 1944 when a magnetic mine damaged her off the Caroline Islands. She stopped in Davao in the Philippines on 19\u201326 July where her damage was inspected and on 1 August she reached Yokosuka for repairs. The third was on 17 February 1945 when she was leaving the Port of Singapore. Her stern struck a mine in the Singapore Strait but she returned to port and was repaired. In March and April the Mitsubishi dockyard at Yokohama made further repairs on her, and from 21 June to 4 July she was drydocked at Maizuru.\n\n\n== Post-war service ==\n\nWhen Japan surrendered on 15 August Hikawa Maru was one of only two Japanese large passenger ships to have survived the war. The other was another hospital ship, Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Takasago Maru. Hie Maru and Heian Maru had been converted into submarine depot ships and were attacked and sunk in 1943 and '44.The USA occupied Japan and in September 1945 the Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine (SCAJAP) requisitioned Hikawa Maru as ship number H-022. She repatriated thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians from the Pacific Islands, Korea, the Dutch East Indies and China until August 1946, when she docked in Yokohama for repairs.In 1947 SCAJAP returned Hikawa Maru to NYK, which despite her passenger capacity ran her mostly as a cargo ship until 1953. Her work included general cargo between Japan and the East Coast of the United States, a liner service between Japan and Burma in 1949, and iron ore from Thailand. In the war NYK had lost 172 ships totalling 1.028 million gross tons, which may explain why the company used an ocean liner for any cargo.\nIn 1953 NYK had Hikawa Maru refitted as an ocean liner and returned her to her pre-war Yokohama \u2013 Seattle route. She remained on the route until NYK decommissioned her on 21 December 1960. Her peacetime service on the route 1930\u201341 and 1953\u201360 totalled 238 voyages and 25,000 passengers.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nIn 1961 Hikawa Maru was permanently berthed at Yamashita Park, Naka-ku, Yokohama as a floating museum, hotel and restaurant. In 2005 her owners announced that they had suffered substantial financial losses and were seeking to sell Hikawa Maru. In December 2006 her museum was closed and doubts about her future were raised. However, NYK Line underwrote her restoration, which began in August 2007. She was renamed NYK Hikawamaru and was reopened to the public at Yamashita Park on 25 April 2008.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nTate, E. Mowbray (1986).

Originally, at night, the tower shaft itself was lit green and red according to its markings, but now, after the reopening on May 2009, the lights are white.\n\n\n== History ==\nYokohama Marine Tower was inaugurated in 1961. The Marine Tower is billed \"the tallest lighthouse in the world\", although this depends on what lighthouses are considered. In clear conditions, visitors can see Mount Fuji from the 100-metre high observation deck.\nOn December 25, 2006, Marine Tower temporarily shut its doors. Then the city of Yokohama took over ownership, to restore it.

        "wiki": "Yamate (\u5c71\u624b) is the name of a historic neighbourhood in Naka-ku, Yokohama often referred to in English as The Bluff. The neighbourhood is famous as having been a foreigners' residential area in the Bakumatsu, Meiji and Taish\u014d periods. While still dominantly residential in character, with views over downtown Yokohama, historic residential properties, ornamental gardens and public parks, the area is also a popular visitor destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Port of Yokohama first opened to foreign trade under the terms of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1859, the foreigner's settlement was initially confined to a low-lying area known as Kannai. As commercial activity in the Kannai settlement rapidly outgrew the available space, construction on the elevated Yamate Bluff started in 1862. Initially a residential area for the foreign diplomatic community, one of the first structures to be built on the Bluff was the residence of the British Consul-General, Sir Rutherford Alcock.\n\n\n=== British Military Garrison ===\nFrom 1862 until 1875, British diplomatic and commercial interests were protected by a troop garrison stationed at Yamate at the crest of the hill overlooking the harbour, a location that now serves as Harbour View Park. After a series of attacks on the British legation at Yedo a military guard for British diplomats stationed at Yokohama was first established in 1860. In 1861 this small detachment was supplemented by Royal Marines from HMS Renard. Much larger numbers of troops of the 20th (East Devonshire) Regiment of the Foot arrived on troopship HMS Vulcan in January 1864, together with two companies of the 2nd Baloochees from the Bombay Native Infantry.  A Marine battalion arrived on May 25, 1864, aboard HMS Conqueror, bringing garrison troop numbers in that year to 1,700. In subsequent years these units were replaced by members of the 9th (East Norfolk),11th, 67th and the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot.\n\n Contemporary maps produced in 1864 indicate that officer and troop accommodation, a naval hospital, stores facilities and a large parade ground stretched from the modern park area overlooking the harbour as far as the current location of Christ Church, Yokohama. Team sports, notably cricket and rugby union, were introduced to Japan for the first time on the parade ground by British service personnel.Conditions in the camp varied greatly; while the wooden huts of the 20th regiment afforded greater protection from the vagaries of the weather, bell tents assigned to the Marine Battalion provided little protection against the torrential rain and humidity of the Yokohama summer. Detailed Royal Navy medical records of the period reported frequent smallpox outbreaks among the troops and that a dysentery epidemic shortly after the arrival of the Marine Battalion in the summer of 1864 claimed the lives of 11 men.During the same period the French diplomatic mission also had a smaller detachment of troops located at a site adjacent to its own consular property. A French military hospital was also established the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Historic Residential Properties ==\n\nOver succeeding years during the Meiji era, many senior officers of the Kannai trading companies, oyatoi gaikokujin and the diplomatic representatives of other trading nations established homes in the neighbourhood.\nAlthough many of the original foreign resident's accommodation and civic buildings were destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, a number of older Meiji and Taish\u014d Period properties have been preserved and relocated to this neighbourhood. The buildings and their ornamental gardens are open to the public free of charge and serve as popular tourist attractions, many featuring tea rooms, art and seasonal ikebana exhibits. Current properties from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and early Showa periods open to visitors include:\n\nDiplomat's House (1910) designed for Japanese Ambassador Sadatsuchi Uchida by James McDonald Gardiner. Located adjacent to the Bluff 18 House in the Italian Garden Park.\nThe Ehrismann Residence (1927) designed by Antonin Raymond\nBerrick Hall (1930) designed by Jay H. Morgan as the residence of a British trading merchant.\nFormer British Consul's Residence (1937) located in Harbour View Park\nYamate 111 House designed by Jay H. Morgan and the Yamate 234 house.\n\n\n== Sightseeing and local landmarks ==\n\nThe area features the campuses of Yokohama International School, Saint Maur International School and Ferris University.  Additionally:\n\nHarbour View Park Minato no mieru oka koen (\u6e2f\u306e\u898b\u3048\u308b\u4e18\u516c\u5712)\nYokohama Foreign General Cemetery established in 1859, contains graves and memorials to many prominent members of the Bakumatsu and Meiji Period foreign community. There is also a small museum on site with photographs and descriptions of individual community members and their contributions to the development of Yokohama.\nAnglican, Christ Church first established in Yamashita-cho in 1863\nCatholic, Sacred Heart Cathedral first established in Yamashita-cho in 1862\nKirin Park adjacent to the location of William Copeland's original Spring Valley Brewery, the first beer production facility of any notable size in Japan.\nYokohama Country & Athletic Club, Japan's oldest sporting and social club founded in 1868.\nFormer Negishi Racecourse. Constructed in 1866 as a replacement for the original 1862 Swamp Ground racecourse at the rear of the Kannai foreign settlement. Home to some of the earliest horse races in Japan, conducted in a recognisably European style. Horseracing came to and end at the site in 1942. Now a public park and home to a small museum of horseracing.  The main grandstand designed in 1929 by American architect Jay H. Morgan is still a prominent landmark.\nItalian Garden Park\nGaiety Theatre Museum, built on the site of the Gaiety Theatre established in 1866.\nThe Yokohama Cat Museum\nThe Yokohama Tin Toys MuseumThe neighborhood still maintains a reputation as an exclusive residential district today, along with the Motomachi neighborhood located at the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nYamate is served by Motomachi-Ch\u016bkagai Station, the terminus of the Minatomirai Line subway. Pedestrian access to and from the station and the historic properties on the Yamate ridge road is facilitated by elevators and escalators rising directly from the station on Motomachi Shopping Street to America-yama Park.\nIshikawacho Station on the JR East Negishi Line provides alternative pedestrian access to sites such as the Italian Garden Park, Bluff 18 House and Ferris University. Yamate Station, also on the JR East Negishi Line, serves the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club and the site of the former Negishi Racecourse.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Sakai Toshihiko (\u583a \u5229\u5f66, November 25, 1871 - January 23, 1933) was a Japanese socialist, writer, and historian. He is also known by the pen name Saka Kosen (\u583a\u67af\u5ddd). He is also known for his translation with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSakai was born as the third son to a samurai class family in what is now Miyako, Fukuoka. He attended what is now the Kaisei Academy where he studied the English language. However, he was expelled from the prestigious No.1 Higher Middle School for failure to pay his tuition, and worked as a tutor and a journalist in Fukuoka and Osaka while studying literature on his own, and writing works of fiction. He was invited to Tokyo by Suematsu Kench\u014d to stay at the residence of the former M\u014dri clan to help edit a history of the Meiji Restoration.Afterwards, he went to work for the Yorozu Morning News, where he began to support social justice causes and pacifism.In 1903, Sakai established the socialist organization Heiminsha, together with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku and Uchimura Kanz\u014d. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Yorozu Morning News adopted a pro-government stance, and Sakai quit to form the weekly Heimin Shimbun together with Sh\u016bsui K\u014dtoku, which was critical of the war and decried the high taxes which the war was causing. It also published a Japanese translation of the Communist Manifesto in its November 13, 1904, issue. Sakai was sentenced to two months in jail. Sakai was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto movement, helping create the Japana Esperanto-Instituto in 1906.In 1906, Sakai became one of the founding members of the Japan Socialist Party. He was arrested in the 1908 Red Flag Incident and was sentenced to two years in prison. Following the end of the First World War he participated in  Rousoukai group. In 1922, he became one of the founding members of the Japan Communist Party and was elected to a seat in the Tokyo City Assembly in 1929. Sakai translated many works related to socialism, as well as utopian literature into Japanese. In June 1932, he was admitted to a hospital after an incident of domestic violence under suspicion of insanity, and died of a cerebral hemorrhage on January 23, 1933. His grave is at the temple of S\u014dj\u014d-ji in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapanese dissidence during the Sh\u014dwa period\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\ne-texts of Sakai's works at Aozora Bunko",

It\u2019s slow as full of tourist and very crowded. It also charge 300 yen per person to go in, but once you bought the ticket , no one",
          "Very much a highlight of anyone's visit to Kamakura. Not the largest buddha in Japan but it is very much a magnificent serene statue. It is located in a wonderful temple setting. We visited Kamakura before Covid 19 and we were able to visit the interior of the buddha for a",
          "Visiting the Great Buddha is a must if you are enjoying a day (or more) in Kamakura. The size of the statue, especially given the time it was made, will humble even the most difficult-to-impress observer. It is also possible to go inside the statue for very nominal fee",
          "What a wonderful day. We took the train from Tokyo to Kamakura to see the Great Buddha. We walked through the town to the Buddha so we could see the sights. It was Amazing. Cast in 1252 when Kamakura was an Ancient Capitol of Japan (1192-1333). The statue is 36 feet in",
          "I was very lucky as I got to see the Daibutsu (Giant Buddha) statue during the covid Pandemic and the weather was perfect. Only a hand full of people. Easy to get to from both Hase tram station and from Kamakura station. I didn't get to climb the stairs inside the statue as",
          "Kotoku-in temple is famous for its Great Buddha (Daibutsu). And its worth. The Buddha is quite big (13m tall) and (at least when I was there it wasn't too crowded). If you pay 20yen you can get inside. It's very curious. It's the highlight of Kamakura",
          "You can walk into inside of the Buddha at the additional cost of \u00a520 (\u00a5300 to enter kotokuin) nothing much to see but when I enter, I felt like going into total darkness but in minutes, I noticed it wasn't dark at all. The magic of human eyes! * Due to COVID-19, this activity",

          "When people mention about visiting Kamakura, the great Buddha is a must see. The grounds are quite empty, except for the Buddha. I thought it was quite expensive to just go in a see the statue. Also, you need to pay extra (though only 20 yen) to see the inside of the Buddha.",

          "The giant Buddha was my main reason to visit kamakura, it did not disappoint, but then I love religious shrines and statues. It is a huge bronze statue which survived a tsunami in the 15th century. You can go inside and understand how it was constructed. Or wander in the gardens.",
          "It is always good to spend sometime here to get some fresh air with the spiritual ambiance. Not far from the station, this place is suitable for family visit, to get a good photos, and to learn about Japanese Buddhism. Garden is located behind the statue, and there is an",
          "It's really impressive no matter how many times you have seen it. The sheer size is awe-inspiring. You will get goosebumps just by looking at it. Words are not enough, you have to see it with your own eyes. There's a 300 yen fee to enter the grounds and 20 more to actually enter",

There\u2019s a small visitation space underneath the Buddha but that one is not worth it. The stores around are great to buy souvenirs",

          "Big Buddha is amongst the main attractions of Kamakura and it delivers. It\u2019s a beautiful big statue of Buddha overlooking the city inside the shrine grounds. Behind the Buddha, there is small shrine grounds but nothing worth mentioning. Overall it\u2019s a smaller Buddha than \u201cBig",
          "The ancient bronze Buddha statue is iconic of Kamakura . It is relatively small ground to visit. But it is still worth the while to pay a visit if in the area. The fun part of the visit is taking the Enoshima train from Kamakura station.",
          "Simple to get to by train from Tokyo. I opted to walk from the Train Station to the Great Buddha, which was not a problem, a little hot and you need about 30 minutes. Loved walking the streets of this town and seeing some of the local vibe. Very busy location and tour buses",

          "We enjoyed our trip to Kotoku-in and the beautiful temple. We did go inside the Buddha statue, it was underneath and a little claustrophobic. Would not recommend it. The outside and the garden were more worthwhile.",
          "A lovely garden \u3082\u307f\u3058 or maple foliage enhanced our experience. A huge statue and there is a great feeling of serenity despite the onslaught of tourists every five minutes. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It's a beautiful statue and a serene compound. It's worth a visit from Tokyo. But don't visit Kamakura only for this.",
          "Nothing more to be said about this beautiful statue, it's amazing. Just like everything, if you come early it will be a better experience, but you can't do everything early, I would advise doing this one early. We came a little after opened and were able to get some great",
          "In my opinion, it is not worth a visit by itself. But as it is a 5 minutes walk from the Hase Kannon Temple, which we did want to visit, we did go there. After a short visit, we took the bus directly to Kamakura train station.",
          "To visit this very impressive monumental statue you have to pay a small amount ( 400,00 Yen ) to enter, is really worth it. When visiting the surroundings of Kamakura it is a \"must\" visiting this area and meet the \"Great Buddha\"",
          "Incredible site to see. The Great Buddha of Kamakura was cast 750 years ago. Get here early to avoid the crowds. The JR railway takes you to Kamakura station and you ride the local subway (200 \u00a5 ) three stops to Hase. The Great Buddha is about a 10-15 walk from the Hase",
          "The price to visit the place is not high, about 5 euro for two people, however as it is just a statue it could be free a charge. It does worth the visit, as European I don't have often the chance to see such a big Buddha statue. So I do suggest to visit but keep in mind that",
          "Buda of light is a towering statue made of bronze. It was built by the ruling shogum after winning the war against the opposing party. Once pacified it was an era in which fir example the writing from China was introduced and thus enlightenment",
          "The center peace of a visit to Kamakura is really worthy to visit. Even with all the crowd of tourists take your time to also enter the statue, but take care of the narrow steps inside. It was build with remarkable skill fro many pieces and has resisted even to the great Kanto",
          "My wife and I took a day trip. Out of Tokyo down to Enoshima and whilst in the area we visited the Giant Buddha. It is indeed giant, being so big that you can go inside for a small fee. The Buddha is inside a small park with other ornate and interesting items and structures and",
          "Entry is at 300 yen. Not much inside but still interesting to visit the big Buddha statue, so I think the price is fair. Avoid the crowd by going early in the morning. Toilets available and also small shop for refreshments and souvenirs.",
          "Pretty big Buddha providing good photo op. Little town of Kamakura was nice to explore along the streets. Old style town",
          "This Buddha is amazing. This Buddha is quite big and the craftmanship is impressive. This was one of my favorite Buddha's to see. You can walk inside of him...very cool.",
          "This is a very average temple. The age of the Buddha and the fact that it has survived quakes and fires is a testament to it's builders many hundreds of years ago. For \u00a520 you can go inside to see how it was constructed. Good to wander around as there are small lakes, and the",
          "the sheer size of the statue is quite impressive, just think about how there used to be roof above...and it is said that ancient coins were melted to forge the hull of the buddha, full of interesting thoughts really.",
          "We went from Tokyo to Kamakura for a day trip and we loved it. They say it\u2019s like a \u201cmini Kyoto\u201d. The big Buddha is such a sight and we went to a couple of other shrines too. It was a good calm day, nice to get out of the craziness of Tokyo too.",
          "Jump on a local train out of Shimbashi . Get off at Kamakura and change to the small electric train for Hase. It\u2019s then just a short walk through the village past numerous small restaurant and local craft shops selling many good quality souvenirs to the Great Buddha. What a",
          "This statue is stunning in person, but there is not much to see immediately around. The Buddha is enough to merit a visit.",
          "It was far from Tokyo but it was worth the ride. There was an entrance of \u00a5300 and a little more if you want to go insiden the statue. So many tourists yes but mostly students. Definitely worthy to add in you itinerary in your next or first visit to Tokyo. It\u2019s just less than an",
          "Nicely set garden temple with a 7 centuries old Buddha statue and great surrounding too. Kamakura city is worth visiting as the tempo is slower and the other Hasedera temple ,which is within walking distance from each others, is equally serene with nice garden setting to fill",
          "I've seen people uploading photos on the great Buddha in Kamakura a long time before I finally had the chance to visit it. With its long history, it's really surprising how well-maintain it was. so I finally ventured into Kamakura about two weeks ago and see it with my own eyes.",
          "Very easy to get great photos at this attraction. Everyone there was very respectful of others taking your photos. Well worth making the trip",
          "While it is certainly remarkable that they built such a big statue with a very ingenious technique, it is really just one statue and nothing more. Pass by if you will but don\u2019t go too much out of your way for it.",
          "The Great Buddha stands nearly 12 metres high and is an impressive sight. Made of bronze, the verdigris patina adds to the grandeur of the statue. Make sure you go inside, where you can see how they re-welded the head in 1960. A must see if visiting Kamakura or Tokyo.",
          "A must to visit to see the big Buddha, spectacular. About 40 mins from Tokyo. Crowded with many tourists.",
          "This attraction hardly needs commendation, since it's why everyone comes to Kamakura. It exceeded expectation - a most impressive statue and ambience. It is worth looking round the rest of the town, too.",
          "Kotoku-in or the Great Budda of Kamakura will exceed you expectations, in size and profound impact. Many visitors but well managed and not swarming with tourists.",
          "Very nice area to walk around in and enjoy some of the best temples in Kamakura. Beware of mosquitoes!",
          "If you haven't seen a giant buddha and you're in Kamakura, go for it! If you want to complete your collection of visiting all the Daibutsus in Japan, go for it! Otherwise, there may be other Kamakura sights more worth your time.",
          "The location of the giant buddha is about 18 minutes walk from yuigahama station or about 25 minutes from Kamakura station. It is a nice place to visit with friends and family, there are also lots of seats around and a garden.",
          "The great Buddha or Daibutsu. THE main tourist attraction in Kamakura. When I came here for the very first time in 1973(!) and you compare it with the present situation a lot and I really mean a lot has changed. In 1973 I was about the only Western tourist in town while at",
          "A very beautiful bronze Buddha statue. Only 100 yen entry. About 2k walk from the station and worth it.",
          "An impressive bronze Buddha statue in Kamakura. It was 200 Yen to enter (July 2019) and for an extra 20 Yen, you can go inside the statue. It was interesting to see inside the Buddha, but probably not worth the queues when it's very busy. The statue is inside a large open",
          "The Great budda is the one thing you have to see in Kamakura. I would not go specially there to see it, but if you are spending some time in the area, it is worth going. There is a very nice hiking trail beginning just behind the Great Buddha.",
          "This is a popular site so be prepared for a crowd. The Great Buddha is 750 years old and an iconic image. Read the history and posters about this before going or while there. It\u2019s an additional \u00a520 to go inside but it is worthwhile if you are interested in the construction.",
          "This Buddha is the 2nd largest Buddha statue in Japan. What is amazing is that it was built 750 years ago! For 20 yen, you can actually walk into the statue and see how it was constructed. The entrance into it is at the rear side.",
          "Rather than constant shopping, not bad for a family trip to travel to this area and visit this area. See and understand how in medieval times a bronze buddha was constructed.",
          "I wanted to see mount Fuji with out traveling to far so I researched this small town was a good bet but only on a clear day however I came across Great Buddha of Kamakura and Its Spectacular, this whole area is a lovely place with a lot more",

          "The other temples and shrines in Kamakura are indeed historic, inspiring and beautiful, but the Great Buddha is truly a wonder to see. Yes, there are larger Buddhas in China and Hong Kong, but remember that this bronze Buddha was cast in the year 1252 and stands some 11.4",
          "There is a minimal entry fee. Upon entering the gates you will go through a nice garden, then see the Great Buddha. It has an interesting history, and the workmanship is especially nice considering it was completed in 1252. We entered right when it opened at 8:00 am, there",
          "Definitely a must do if you\u2019re in Japan. We did this as a day trip from Tokyo. It was easily accessible by train. The great Buddha is beautiful !! The surrounding gardens are lovely too. We were expecting that Saturday would be crowded but it wasn\u2019t. Plenty of gift shops near",

          "One of the two major sights in Kamakura, the Daibutsu is a must-see. The temple associated with this figure is K\u014dtoku-in, and worth taking a look at too. As with most Japanese shrines or temples, seasonal gardens are also a major feature. We visited in late spring, so the",

          "The temple is most famous for the big Buddha at the centre of it. It's humongous, but not as big as the one in Todai Ji. Nor is it made of Bronze. Overall, this one loses in comparison to the temple in Nara, but it gets points for trying. Not everything can be number one, but",

          "The place has the mixed reviews, but we loved it. Peaceful vibes, the statue itself is impressive. Yes, we saw many statues of Buddha in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand\u2026you can\u2019t compare them because each of statue has own energy. Obviously, we did not go inside the Buddha.",

          "Went there from Tokyo by metro and the really old but wonderfully restored old Train. The Buddha is amazing, even when there are more temples in the city where you can spend much more time on.",

It\u2019s only a few hundred yen to enter and 20 yen more to go into the statue. I recommend both. There\u2019s lots of little shops along the way to the",
          "I went early in the morning to avoid the crowd!!! Big bronzen statue of Daibutsu...garden around is nice and quiet. You can go inside the Daibutsu , to see how they built it. It\u2019s worth to visit this place when you are in Kamakura... An hour away from Tokyo!!",

          "Very easy to get to from Kamakura station. Get the bus from stop 1 and 6. It\u2019s a small temple with a big statue. Easy to find and walk around. The Buddha is not on a peak or anything. Try and go early as it gets busy around 11am onwards!",
          "I would highly recommend if you have an extra day during your stay in Tokyo, to take a quick trip to Kamakura. It's only about an hour from Tokyo and it's a beautiful seaside town. We opted to take the Daibatsu Hiking Trail that ended with Kotoku-in, the Great Buddha. It's",

          "It\u2019s a big 13m buddah so that\u2019s got be worth seeing, right? It\u2019s an easy walk from the train station and has a small entrance fee, but nothing that would make you not go in. You can go inside the buddah, but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to queue so can\u2019t say if it\u2019s worth it or not.",

          "This statue is a 15 minute walk from the local train , it is very worth while to visit , as you can go inside the Buddha from a rear door. There is a small fee for this , but it is worth doing. Because it is a very popular site with locals and visitors the train may be busy ,",
          "Located at Kamakura u can see a big statue of Buddha . The atmosphere is very clean. And it is not so expensive. Lots of people praying and wishing makes u happy. Being a nepalese it really feels good to see that big statue of Lord Buddha .",

          "It's a very small compound and the Buddha, while old, is not as large as some photos make it seem. Much larger Buddha in Hong Kong. Going into the statue is possible, but very tight.",

          "Stunner. This impressive, magnificent Buddha is a national treasure. Built in 1252 (took TEN years) it is imposing and beautiful. I have been here twice. Once there were NO people and one time JAM PACKED on the weekend. So if you can visit on a week day maybe that is",
          "After many trips to Japan, this was my first time to go to Kamakura to see Buddha. Although not as big as the Buddha at Todaiji in Nara, this Buddha is still impressive. There are hoardes of tourists but that is to be expected at all of the famous temples and sites in Japan.",
          "We were already in Kamakura and visited the Great Buddha in the Kotoku-in Temple. Lots of people were there - cherry blossom season and of course the main attraction, the Great Buddha. It's certainly a large casting of Buddha - weighing in at 120+ tons and is 11+ metres high.",
          "I saw the great Buddha in Nara which is the largest one in Japan. With that said, I really enjoyed this experience in Kamakura much better. It\u2019s located outside and you can really tell how big it was. I went in the morning and it was much less crowded. There are places to sit",
          "The last time I saw the Big Buddha was 15 years ago. It hasn't changed, which is not a surprise as it hasn't changed in the past 700 years. The only difference are the crowds. Though worth a visit, I suggest taking a seat in the shade and spending a moment with Buddha-san in",

          "Very odd going to a Buddha and there being no rules. We were allowed to wear what we wanted, turn our backs, take photos etc. Cherry blossoms here were lovely, but I\u2019d seen them around other areas better. 200\u00a5 to get in is reasonable for upkeep and provide toilet facilities",

          "Easy to see and find (no exhausting steps up) and landscaped nicely around the Buddha. He is green from having some copper in his construction! You can go inside, which is not terribly exciting but he is earthquake-proofed.... on site rest rooms and gift shop. Not too many",
          "I visited as a day trip from Tokyo. This is an impressive sight. So happy to see it survive the destruction of WW2. I've seen this before in pictures but it is more impressive in person. Please remember this is still a place of worship so be respectful.",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit. The statue of the Buddha is almost 44 feet tall. It is made of copper. It dates back to the 1200s. For a small fee, you can enter it. In front of the statue is a place for offering incense. This is more than just a tourist destination.",
          "There are many temples and shrines in the area, this is a good climax after visiting them. From Kitakamakura station there is a trail (signposted) which you can take passing the Jochi-Ji Temple then the Zeniarai Benzaiten Ugafuku Shrine before finishing at the Great Buddha. This",
          "The Buddha was cool, and going inside was fun, but it wasn't super exciting. I've seen better buddhas elsewhere.",
          "I noticed the great buddha has the largest number of reviews for attractions in Kamakura. The buddha is long standing and just huge, which simply makes us feel something special. Kamakura is definitely a destination of a day trip from Tokyo, and the buddha is a must see.",
          "We stayed a night at Yokohama and could use our rail pass to reach this place easily after a short ride. It is a lively place and along the way there are many shops. This great Buddha has a gentle serene look. Along the way, we spotted many species of hydrangea flowers.",
          "Very nice to see. We rented bikes at the station and biked here using GPS. Entry is 200y. From here we went to hokokuji temple (bamboo temple) across town which I highly recommend seeing.",
          "2 trains from Tokyo and only about an hour of travelling brings us to the seaside. A stroll along the prom and a visit to a huge Buddha Statue made for a good day out. It was nice to get out of the city and some nice fresh sea air. The temple / shrine was as busy as many of them",
          "Most other structures of Kotokuin didn't survive natural disasters such as fire or earthquake etc, the outdoor great Buddha becomes the main and only point of interest of this temple. For this reason Kotokuin is not the best temple in Kamakura, nonetheless, the great Buddha",
          "We easily traveled here from the Yokohama Port Terminal and were happy we did it. From the ship port, you take the subway to the Yokohama terminal, hop on a train to Kamakura station. From there take the Honada electric train to Fugisawa. Get off at Hase station. Walk about",
          "One of the biggest statues of Buda in the World. Quiet and peacfull place. We were very luck that day we went there it was raining so it made the expirience even better.",
          "I have seen the tallest bronze Buddha statue in the world at Todaiji Temple, Nara but this one is equally as impressive as it's not undercover. I was lucky to see it on a beautiful sunny day too. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful and sereen area. Although busy, still sereen. Amasing statue and you can even get in. Quit a walk from the station, but that was ok\u00e9.",
          "Such a great place to visit. Definitely try a guided tour to get in the history about the place to really appreciate it.",
          "Really interesting to visit although when we were here is was very busy. Make sure you go inside the Buddha to see how it was made.",
          "y to make the trip to kamakura is a great idea. It takes nearly two hours to arrive. You can enjoy a trking arround the shrines for near 6-10 km easy going. The experience of seeing the buda is bbreath taking. There is an interesting shrine from kanon and the only goodnes (in a",
          "Historical place to visit with a very beautiful garden. Don't forget to go inside it, it's a nice structure to know.",
          "If you are in Kanto area, it's definitely a must to visit place! We visited with our relatives and its children. All enjoyed! If you pay \u00a520 you can go inside the Great Buda and take some pics as well. The kids had fun there!",
          "One big Buddha as central of attraction - surrounded by ok-ish looking garden. You can buy ticket to enter into the basement to have a feel of what it's like to be inside a bronze statue. 2 shops selling typical souvenirs - nothing great....",
          "It's totally worthy to take the day to discover Kamakura and visit the gigantic statue of Buddha, we walk there from Nishi-Kamakura station. Wonderful views on the way",
          "Saw this remarkable Buddha in 2005 but, while in Japan in August, I had to go back. The town outside of the Buddha shrine is nice.",
          "the great buddha is definitely worth visiting. in fact, Kamakura is so compact that you can visit the different shrines by foot and by train. you don't need to bus or drive. you can even do a side trip to enoshima all in a day. very enjoyable. great place to buy souvenirs.",
          "I went to Kamakura to visit several shrines and the kotoku-in was one of them. I went there to see the famous Buddha statue, which is really impressive!! Except this statue, nothing really interesting to see. I recommand it for the statue but no need to stay a long time in this",
          "The buddha itself is huge and can even go inside and pray, if im not mistaken. But most people, just wanna check inside for curiosity (count me in). And yeah, you need to pay a ticket to look around.maybe less than \u00a51000/head. There's a hotel nearby the place, you wanna check on",
          "We paid a few hundred yen for an entrance fee. The Buddha is so big that he is awe-inspiring. Anyone that is in Yokohama should make the pilgrimage. I was impressed by the feel of the place. There were hundreds of people there but the serenity was intact. It is a monastery",
          "Visit to the Great Budda as a direct result of my first WESTPAC aboard the USS Pintado (SSN 672) fall of 1977. A few of our crew members and I went there to enjoy some of the wonderful Japanese culture. The train system in Japan made it really easy to get around.This format asks",
          "Its a great destination.i went from shin yokohama to kamakura station local japan train.you need to change the 2 trains blue and gree line.the buddha statue is amazing.i offered prayers.as i went in peak summer lot of humidity.unfortunately my team followed walking nearly 14 km",
          "We stayed in Yokohama so it was a handy place to visit for a day with a day ticket of monorail and Enoden tram. A lovely town to visit and my kids enjoyed exploring the inside of the Buddha.",
          "This place is about an hour train ride from Tokyo and there is quite a walk involved to get there from the train station unless you catch a bus. The neighborhood is nice though the Buddha and area was a bit overrated in my opinion; would not go back.",
          "A place full of Energy, and great history. The statue of Buddha itself is a survival of a tsunami of fifteen century. By knowing this you will have an idea how strong and solid is the statue. Huge, gorgeous...it simply impress by its size.",
          "A must see attraction when visiting Kamakura area. It's only about 10 minutes walk from the train station and there are lots of souvenir shops lined up the streets leading to the Giant Buddha. The entrance fee is only 200 yen (or $2). There are also lots of important historic",
          "Photos don't do this place justice. What an incredible place. Beautiful grounds. Wonderful shop beside the Great Buddha (kind of tacky one outside the entrance). Skip the one outside and get more authentic meaningful items inside. It was crowded but manageable. Highly recommend",
          "If you will google Kamakura then the first thing that pops out is the Great Buddha ! So its a must visit place in Kamakura because of its historical and cultural significance. It is walk-able distance from the station. The whole crowd moves to the same direction so you can",
          "For a mere \u00a5200 you can stroll through mini groves which reveal an enormous Buddha. It's a short walk from the centre of town and is well signposted",
          "The Big Buddha is majestic! We could enter the statue for JPY 20 cent only. The area also has souvenir shops, and peaceful garden. Kamakura area is relatively quite and peaceful. Souvenirs here are also cheaper compared to Kyoto or Osaka.",
          "Very nice statue, only 50 yen to go inside of it. But the area is very busy, and hard to get good photos.",
          "We visited this second biggest bronze Buddha in Japan a few days after we visited the biggest Buddha . He is a very handsome Buddha and stands there all alone and without a building ! For a small fee you can go inside! Very important to Japanese history.",
          "This great buddha is a huge statue in a beautiful temple. Very near of the metro station. You can walk there through different souvenir stores, which are offering a big variety of snacks and ice creams.",
          "It was a great side trip from Tokyo. It took about an hour by train. From the train there are easy signs to get to the shrine. plus there were a lot of people coming and doing to it. You only need about 45 minutes at the shrine. The walk is about 20 minutes. We hiked the",
          "We arrived to Kamakura rail station about 10_30 am. Started walking and it took us about 20 minutes. You can take a bus which could be quicker. We had a great time looking at the surrounding and also went inside the Big Buddha for a small fee. Peaceful and cool shade greeted us",
          "Travel about 1.30hour from Tokyo Roppongi to kamakura have to change train a fews time to reach there . Seaside place . The ways to go there is not so difficult .i also use Google maps to searching for take a train to Kamakura. But for people visit japan first time and not",
          "This ancient Buddha tucked away in Kamakura is a must see if you are anywhere in the area. So critically important in Japanese history, the journey to this site of veneration is well worth the time.",
          "The Great Buddha was quite impressive -- it doesn't look too big from afar, but the closer you get to it, the more you being to acknowledge its size. I came here with a local guide (c/o Kamakura Welcome Guides), which was great because she was better able to explain to me the",
          "Seeing the statue for the first time gives an aura of peace and solemnity. It was a big statue that it can accommodate more than 50 persons inside. It was awe inspiring to think how people of long ago built an impressive sight. The neighboring sights are impressive as well.",
          "I was just lucky. I took a JR train from Tokyo station at around 8:20. Got to Kamakura after ~1 hour ride. I got to the tourist info centre at the station, grabbed a map then off I went, walking straight to the temple. It took me 20 min to get there. You can take the bus but bus",
          "The Great Buddha is an amazing sight. Absolutely worth a trip from Tokyo. A true piece of art, graceful and timeless. If you know the history of this statue - that would definitely add another dimension to your visit. For a small fee you can enter inside the statue and see how",
          "This Buddha is one of the most oldest temple in the world.This place is very neat and clean and walkable distance from the train station.There is small markets in surroundings.Its worth a watch .Huge Buddha statue .There are details written in surroundings how it was made a",
          "We got to go inside the Buddha. You can pay small fee but closes at 4PM. The walk from the Hase station is about 600m (15 mins on foot). There is no taxi so you have to walk to and from. But well worth it.",
          "As always, we were thrilled to learn about new cultures that we don't get to see back home. This was of course a nice surprise and a chance to learn about this interesting culture. The 13 meters high statue goes back a long way in history, and its way more interesting than you",
          "It is wonder how they build it long time ago with this size. The Buda you enter inside. It is hollow from inside",
          "Although this is a \"must-see\" in Kamakura, the compound was pretty small and we spend about 30 minutes there. Still, it's still a good visit together with the other temples in the area.",
          "The Buddha statue was really cool, and along the sides and behind the compound are nice wooded areas where you can sit on some stones and chill. This was really appreciated, since it was over 30 degrees Celsius (90's Fahrenheit).",
          "First the Buddha is inspiring and for 20 yen you can go inside it. Easy to get to from Kamakura station take the subway. You pay 200 yen and walk in to a fantastic Buddha unfortunately there is not much else to see on the grounds",
          "This huge Budda is worth a visit when in Kamakura. Easy to get to by local bus or the electric railway.",
          "Definitely overrated! Not a must see for a religious place. I suggest taking a nice stroll to the temple and other temples in the vicinity.",
          "Even the kids liked going inside the Buddha and the story about the building that used to house it. This is an iconic site. Glad we came early in the day!",
          "We had a awesome time in Kamakura and visiting the Great Buddha was the center piece of that trip. It was a cool day and the kids enjoyed the area surrounding the statue.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Great Buddha. Of special note is the fact that you can walk into the Buddha and see how he was built. It was quite daunting to picture that the temple around him was washed away in a tidal wave and there we were - wandering around without a care in",
          "The first time I came to visit this amazing Buddha was in 1987. It is still as amazing and huge as it was the first time I saw it. There is a sense of peace on the grounds. There is more to see than the Buddha. It was a very hot day but worth the hike. The area of Kamakura has",
          "We went there in July when the wheather was so humid and sometimes rainy. Maybe it will be better to go during autumn or spring. It is really nice to see it. It is very big.",
          "You take a train to Kanagawa and follow the crowd to visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura. We\u2019ve seen another giant Buddha in Hawaii, and this doesn\u2019t even compare. It\u2019s beyond what you\u2019d ever expect to see. Mystical and awe-striking. The Buddha is so lovely and serene, a",
          "We were four friends and find this great tour guide, Peter. We enjoyed very much and learned a lot about the culture, history and such a beautiful sceneries spots Peter was showing us. I highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to go to Kamakura. We ended up with big",
          "I traveled with a group to the main temple in Kamakura, the bamboo temple, and finished our afternoon with visiting this site. All fit easily into an afternoon. We took a taxi from the bamboo temple to this location, and then a taxi to the train station. This site is on the",
          "Must see if you're in Tokyo and have time to spare. It's about 1.5 hours train ride from Tokyo. You get of at Kamakura station and transfer to the local train to Hase. It's about a 10 minute walk to get to Kotokuin from there. There are signs at the station to direct you",
          "Character of the place is very different depending on how crowded it is -- we happened on it after our first visit and at first, couldn't believe it was the same place without the vendors and the crowd.",
          "We visited on a Sunday in early June. The Buddha can be reached by taking the Enoden Line from Kamakura to Hase. The train journey is a treat in itself. It was filled with local tourists and so a great opportunity to experience Japanese culture. The Buddha is the second",
          "With 19 Shinto shrines & 65 Buddhist temples in Kamakura, this is one of the top sights. Forty four feet tall, cast in 30 separate parts and built in 1252, it is a world class sight. Definitely enjoyed the woven \"buddha sandals\" nearby. Don't miss it.",
          "I could feel the sacredness and a strong presence of divinity in the shrine of the Great Buddha. Worth visiting.",
          "He really is giant! We paid the 20 yen (no typo - that's the right #) to walk up into his belly. Not much to see, but simply a cool thing to do. Be sure to walk into the small gardens. Very peaceful.",
          "It took around 1 hour from Tokyo to this area. You just walked from station to the temple, about 10-15 minutes. You can see the inside of the buddha with additional fee only 10 yen.",
          "Brilliant!! A definite must see.... Very peacefull and quiet neighborhood, go during the week. A place to relax..",
          "It takes about 15 to 20 mins to walk here from the train station. The Buddah is really huge and you can also enter by paying another fee. As it is almost summer it is rather crowded. On the whole I spend less than half an hour there.",
          "Iconic Buddha statue. Can wall from JR Kamakura station using your JR Pass from Tokyo as a day trip. Many shops around the area selling snacks and food.",
          "This place was definitely cool but the place was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. I probably got through the whole place in like twenty minutes. But i guess it was good because it gave me a lot of time to visit other temples, shops and restaurants in kamakura. All in",
          "My grandfather visited this buddha in 1957 and my mom has always wanted to visit it. Located in the Kamakura, it's a nice day trip outside of Tokyo. We walked there from the train station, but there is a bus as well. There is a small fee to get in, but it's not much. The",
          "You can take the train from Tokyo to Kamakura it's wil take about one hour to the station after that it's about 20 minutes walking. The Buddha is big and ancient but definitely worth going!",
          "Arrive early and you will have the whole pavillion for you. This is the second biggest Buddha statue in Japan and, honestly, is much more beautiful the biggest one, which is in Nara. The statue is in open air, so it is a nice contrast between it and the beautiful wood that",
          "We trained from Tokyo to get out of the city for a morning. We stopped at the station before Kamakura and hiked in. Really nice hike about 5 Km and fairly easy takes you right to the Buddha. The Buddha itself is one of the more impressive Buddha statues I've seen and has a cool",
          "It's a pretty and big Buddha. You pay 200 yen as a entry fee and 20 yen if you go inside. Don't plan to spend much time here.",
          "The giant Buddha is hollow and for about 50 cents you can go inside it. There are many shops nearby to eat at. The bathrooms have squat toilets.",
          "The Great Buddha of Kamakura (Daibutsu) is a bronze statue of Amida Buddha, in the Kotokuin Temple. 13.35 meters tall, it is the second tallest bronze Buddha statue in Japan, (only the statue in Nara's Todaiji Temple is taller). The statue itself is very impressive. To me this",
          "You can book a tour but it's actually quite easy to get to on your own. Just take the JR line from Tokyo station all the way to the end of the blue line to Kamakura. From there just put the great Buddha into you google maps and walk there. It's a fair walk but takes you",
          "I got a little lost getting there as I waiting at the wrong bus stop but I figured it out eventually. I was completely awed by the big Buddha. The atmosphere was serene even though it was a very crowded Saturday afternoon. One thing that upset me was the fact that there were",
          "The Great Buddha of Kamakura is small temple compare to Osaka Castle but Buddha Statue was very nice. From Tokyo Station you take the JR to Kamakura Station, then continue with Enoden Line (separate than JR, need to buy new ticket for JPY210/person) and alight at Hase Station.",
          "It's highly recommended to go for a visit and takes about one hour train from Tokyo. When you visit the Buddha, I suggest you to also study the history and its story of building. Its much interesting than just taking photos.",
          "This a nice day trip from Tokyo. The statue is magnificent, the shrine is crowded with many tourists . The are is close to the sea and there are many small temples around.",
          "This was my second visit here, but the first on a Sunday during Sakura Season. It was not the peaceful loveliness it can be, but if you can block out the crowds, shouting, laughing and clambering over each other for the best selfie, you'll be able to enjoy it as much as I. The",
          "Visited the Great Buddha during the Golden week. It was packed with tourists and locals. Although it was crowded, but definitely worth a visit. I came here solely to see the Great Buddha and was surprised to know that you can see the interior of the Buddha also. Surrounding area",
          "Kotokuin is one of the biggest Buddha statues in Japan as it is also known as \"Great Buddha of Kamakura\" and 13 metres tall. The impressive thing about the buddha is the possibility to enter the statue from behind and see the interior. There are always few oranges in front of",
          "Our visit to Kamakura was solely to visit this beautiful Buddah. The grounds and lovely and extremely peaceful. Dont forget to cleanse yourself before entering...,",

          "We went specifically to Kamakura only to visit the temple and the big statue and we were not at all disappointed. The Buddha is magnificent and impressive. You can also go inside the statue. Worth absolutely the trip from Tokyo.",
          "I always wanted to see this beautiful Buddha statue after seeing pictures. In reality, the area is a little smaller than I expected and there were many visitors making it a bit crowded. However, the Daibutsu didn't disappoint. This is one of the most calm and beautiful",
          "truly amazing. to walk into the park and there the Buddha sits. No strenuous hike or long line. Great view from almost everywhere in the park",
          "This will be a memorable visit, just because of the size. The Great Buddha of Kamakura is a humongous copper statue that sits over 35 feet high in the open air. Several sets of stairs lead up to this spectacular statue. It's construction began in 1252 from large pieces of",
          "It's a sweet little park with the Buddha statue. It costs 200 yen to enter the park. There is also some small souvenir shops and a toilet in the park, but not so much more to se.",
          "One of the great sights in Japan, this second largest Buddha is well worth the effort to see (both outside and even the interior). Majestic! A reasonably short walk from the Hasse train station, with many places to shop and eat along the way. My plan was to take the JR to Ofuna,",
          "There are a few different trains from Tokyo to Kamakura station- the tourist information center, and the main bus terminal to all attractions nearby. We went on a Saturday, and there are a group of local students who try to practice their English by volunteering as the local",
          "It was worth the hour or so train ride from Kawasaki. There was a lot of foot traffic but the staff was very efficient and friendly. There is somewhat of a park/lawn area to hang out in. You can pay 20 yen to go inside the statue. It's not a lot of money and something any",
          "Interesting history - pay a few extra yen to go inside of it and see how it was built. The grounds are fantastic. This is an iconic site.",
          "We visited Kamakura as part of a group trip, and it was nice to see this great statue (only if you are in the vicinity).",
          "Please see my review of Enoshima Electric Railway on how to get here. It is very easy. The stop along the railway is Hase. Just follow the crowds, it may be a 10 minute walk. The grounds of the temple are not very big, but nicely laid out with gardens and trees. Seating",
          "The walk from the station is long but I enjoyed looking at the different suburban architecture along the way. The 200yen entrance fee was very reasonable and the buddha itself is very serene and impressive. I also enjoyed going inside the casting (it cost roughly 20yen) to see",
          "Amazing Buddha - wonderful serene expression. Although you can see it in 5 or so minutes, don't rush - just enjoy it.",
          "The Great Buddha (Daibotsu) of Kamakura is probably the best known icon of Japan, appearing in practically any travel brochure or magazine related to travel in Japan. It's a pretty impressive sight, particularly because it has been seated in its posture of deep meditation under",

          "The great Buddha is what remained from a great tsunami. The Great Buddha had a structure around it but was destroyed by the waves. Nice garden around. Great for picture taking.",
          "We saw this Buddha as well as the one in Nara (Todai-ji). These are the 2nd and 1st largest Buddhas in Japan, respectively. The Kotokuin was pretty amazing, and affords a much better view of the Buddha than Todai-ji, although this one is smaller. It's totally open air so you",
          "This is a huge metal status that used to be in a building that was washed away in a Tsunami. Make sure you go inside the Buddha statue as well. And do not forget to head down to Kamakura beach for a stroll afterwards.",

          "My Japanese friend wanted to take us here. From Narita we boarded a train, a subway and another train. Finally after what seemed a nightmare of transportation we walked a short distance to see this Big Budda. I liked the walk through the town, a great restaurant and bought",

          "I visited Kamakura because I was told it was a must while in Japan, I guess I was expecting more, it is a great and big statue, took lots of great pics, but it has nothing to do with the Big Buddha in Hong Kong or the ones in Thailand. I loved the streets of Kamakura and the",
          "It's just a must see if in the area. The Buddha is huge. Awe inspiring. And you don't have to waste a whole day. But always cool to see.",

          "We stopped here on a bike ride (there's lots of places to hire) and locked our bikes to a tree just outside. The Buddha is big and worth a stop, there's some interesting information and a little shop, but otherwise quite a small place to visit, you certainly won't need more than",
          "This statue is impressive and the setting is very serene.The town of kamakura is quaint and filled with hidden treasures",
          "This Buddha is not the largest in Japan, but it is large and impressive. It's a short walk from the Kamakura station. For a small fee, you can climb inside the bum of the Buddha. It's a pretty tight fit, so don't go inside if you are claustrophobic. Many hikes and shrines",
          "Worth trudging up the hill with thousands of tourists and local people to see this statue. Interesting to see the rituals that accompany going to the site.",
          "If you have not seen this giant statue of Buddha, it is definitely worth a visit. The image is peaceful and serene, and his size is remarkable. You can even go inside the statue for an extra 20 yen. Best time is probably a sunny day in spring.",
          "Of course the Buddah statue itself is impressing but with the temple gone due to earthquakes, it is the only thing remaining. Worth to see but done in a couple of minutes.",

          "It's little bit far away from the station and downtown. And the whole temple except the statue is not that big either. Yet, it's still quite interesting to come here~.\n\nJust remember, if you wanna take a look inside of the statue, check the open time first!",

But the place is a nice as not too crowded in the morning.",

        "wiki": "Yamate (\u5c71\u624b) is the name of a historic neighbourhood in Naka-ku, Yokohama often referred to in English as The Bluff. The neighbourhood is famous as having been a foreigners' residential area in the Bakumatsu, Meiji and Taish\u014d periods. While still dominantly residential in character, with views over downtown Yokohama, historic residential properties, ornamental gardens and public parks, the area is also a popular visitor destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Port of Yokohama first opened to foreign trade under the terms of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1859, the foreigner's settlement was initially confined to a low-lying area known as Kannai. As commercial activity in the Kannai settlement rapidly outgrew the available space, construction on the elevated Yamate Bluff started in 1862. Initially a residential area for the foreign diplomatic community, one of the first structures to be built on the Bluff was the residence of the British Consul-General, Sir Rutherford Alcock.\n\n\n=== British Military Garrison ===\nFrom 1862 until 1875, British diplomatic and commercial interests were protected by a troop garrison stationed at Yamate at the crest of the hill overlooking the harbour, a location that now serves as Harbour View Park. After a series of attacks on the British legation at Yedo a military guard for British diplomats stationed at Yokohama was first established in 1860. In 1861 this small detachment was supplemented by Royal Marines from HMS Renard. Much larger numbers of troops of the 20th (East Devonshire) Regiment of the Foot arrived on troopship HMS Vulcan in January 1864, together with two companies of the 2nd Baloochees from the Bombay Native Infantry.  A Marine battalion arrived on May 25, 1864, aboard HMS Conqueror, bringing garrison troop numbers in that year to 1,700. In subsequent years these units were replaced by members of the 9th (East Norfolk),11th, 67th and the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot.\n\n Contemporary maps produced in 1864 indicate that officer and troop accommodation, a naval hospital, stores facilities and a large parade ground stretched from the modern park area overlooking the harbour as far as the current location of Christ Church, Yokohama. Team sports, notably cricket and rugby union, were introduced to Japan for the first time on the parade ground by British service personnel.Conditions in the camp varied greatly; while the wooden huts of the 20th regiment afforded greater protection from the vagaries of the weather, bell tents assigned to the Marine Battalion provided little protection against the torrential rain and humidity of the Yokohama summer. Detailed Royal Navy medical records of the period reported frequent smallpox outbreaks among the troops and that a dysentery epidemic shortly after the arrival of the Marine Battalion in the summer of 1864 claimed the lives of 11 men.During the same period the French diplomatic mission also had a smaller detachment of troops located at a site adjacent to its own consular property. A French military hospital was also established the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Historic Residential Properties ==\n\nOver succeeding years during the Meiji era, many senior officers of the Kannai trading companies, oyatoi gaikokujin and the diplomatic representatives of other trading nations established homes in the neighbourhood.\nAlthough many of the original foreign resident's accommodation and civic buildings were destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, a number of older Meiji and Taish\u014d Period properties have been preserved and relocated to this neighbourhood. The buildings and their ornamental gardens are open to the public free of charge and serve as popular tourist attractions, many featuring tea rooms, art and seasonal ikebana exhibits. Current properties from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and early Showa periods open to visitors include:\n\nDiplomat's House (1910) designed for Japanese Ambassador Sadatsuchi Uchida by James McDonald Gardiner. Located adjacent to the Bluff 18 House in the Italian Garden Park.\nThe Ehrismann Residence (1927) designed by Antonin Raymond\nBerrick Hall (1930) designed by Jay H. Morgan as the residence of a British trading merchant.\nFormer British Consul's Residence (1937) located in Harbour View Park\nYamate 111 House designed by Jay H. Morgan and the Yamate 234 house.\n\n\n== Sightseeing and local landmarks ==\n\nThe area features the campuses of Yokohama International School, Saint Maur International School and Ferris University.  Additionally:\n\nHarbour View Park Minato no mieru oka koen (\u6e2f\u306e\u898b\u3048\u308b\u4e18\u516c\u5712)\nYokohama Foreign General Cemetery established in 1859, contains graves and memorials to many prominent members of the Bakumatsu and Meiji Period foreign community. There is also a small museum on site with photographs and descriptions of individual community members and their contributions to the development of Yokohama.\nAnglican, Christ Church first established in Yamashita-cho in 1863\nCatholic, Sacred Heart Cathedral first established in Yamashita-cho in 1862\nKirin Park adjacent to the location of William Copeland's original Spring Valley Brewery, the first beer production facility of any notable size in Japan.\nYokohama Country & Athletic Club, Japan's oldest sporting and social club founded in 1868.\nFormer Negishi Racecourse. Constructed in 1866 as a replacement for the original 1862 Swamp Ground racecourse at the rear of the Kannai foreign settlement. Home to some of the earliest horse races in Japan, conducted in a recognisably European style. Horseracing came to and end at the site in 1942. Now a public park and home to a small museum of horseracing.  The main grandstand designed in 1929 by American architect Jay H. Morgan is still a prominent landmark.\nItalian Garden Park\nGaiety Theatre Museum, built on the site of the Gaiety Theatre established in 1866.\nThe Yokohama Cat Museum\nThe Yokohama Tin Toys MuseumThe neighborhood still maintains a reputation as an exclusive residential district today, along with the Motomachi neighborhood located at the foot of the Yamate hill.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nYamate is served by Motomachi-Ch\u016bkagai Station, the terminus of the Minatomirai Line subway. Pedestrian access to and from the station and the historic properties on the Yamate ridge road is facilitated by elevators and escalators rising directly from the station on Motomachi Shopping Street to America-yama Park.\nIshikawacho Station on the JR East Negishi Line provides alternative pedestrian access to sites such as the Italian Garden Park, Bluff 18 House and Ferris University. Yamate Station, also on the JR East Negishi Line, serves the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club and the site of the former Negishi Racecourse.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Urashima Tar\u014d (\u6d66\u5cf6 \u592a\u90ce) is the protagonist of a Japanese fairy tale (otogi banashi), who in a typical modern version is a fisherman rewarded for rescuing a turtle, and carried on its back to the Dragon Palace (Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d) beneath the sea. There he is entertained by the princess Otohime as a reward. He spends what he believes to be several days with the princess, but when he returns to his home village, he discovers he has been gone for at least 100 years. When he opens the forbidden jewelled box (tamatebako), given to him by Otohime on his departure, he turns into an old man.\nThe tale originates from the legend of Urashimako (Urashima no ko or Ura no Shimako) recorded in various pieces of literature dating to the 8th century, such as the Fudoki for Tango Province, Nihon Shoki, and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b.\nDuring the Muromachi to Edo periods, versions of Urashima Tar\u014d appeared in storybook form called the Otogiz\u014dshi, made into finely painted picture scrolls and picture books or mass-printed copies. These texts vary considerably, and in some, the story ends with Urashima Tar\u014d transforming into a crane.\nSome iconic elements in the modern version are relatively recent. The portrayal of him riding a turtle dates only to the early 18th century, and while he is carried underwater to the Dragon Palace in modern tellings, he rides a boat to the princess's world called H\u014drai in older versions..\n\n\n== Folktale or fairy tale ==\nThe Urashima Tar\u014d tales familiar to most Japanese follows the storyline of children's tale author Iwaya Sazanami in the Meiji period. A condensed version of Sazanami's retelling then appeared in Kokutei ky\u014dkasho, Japan's nationally designated textbook for the elementary school, and became widely read by the schoolchildren of the populace. Modern versions of Urashima Tar\u014d, which are generally similar, are demonstrably based on the story from these nationally designated textbook series.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOne day a young fisherman named Urashima Tar\u014d is fishing when he notices a group of children torturing a small turtle. Tar\u014d saves it and lets it to go back to the sea. The next day, a huge turtle approaches him and tells him that the small turtle he had saved is the daughter of the Emperor of the Sea, Ry\u016bjin, who wants to see him to thank him. The turtle magically gives Tar\u014d gills and brings him to the bottom of the sea, to the Palace of the Dragon God (Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d). There he meets the Emperor and the small turtle, who was now a lovely princess, Otohime. On each of the four sides of the palace it is a different season.\nTar\u014d stays there with Otohime for three days, but soon wants to go back to his village and see his aging mother, so he requests permission to leave. The princess says she is sorry to see him go, but wishes him well and gives him a mysterious box called tamatebako which will protect him from harm but which she tells him never to open. Tar\u014d grabs the box, jumps on the back of the same turtle that had brought him there, and soon is at the seashore.\nWhen he goes home, everything has changed. His home is gone, his mother has vanished, and the people he knew are nowhere to be seen. He asks if anybody knows a man called Urashima Tar\u014d. They answer that they had heard someone of that name had vanished at sea long ago. He discovers that 300 years have passed since the day he left for the bottom of the sea. Struck by grief, he absent-mindedly opens the box the princess had given him, from which bursts forth a cloud of white smoke. He is suddenly aged, his beard long and white, and his back bent. From the sea comes the sad, sweet voice of the princess: \"I told you not to open that box. In it was your old age ...\".\n\n\n== Commonly known version ==\n\nA summary of the Urashima tale from one of the nationalized textbooks (Kokutei ky\u014dkasho) will be given below. The base text used will be Urashima Tar\u014d (\u3046\u3089\u3057\u307e\u592a\u90ce), from the 3rd edition of the Kokugo tokuhon or \"national language reader\", a widely familiar textbook used during the 1918\u20131932 period. An English translation has been provided in Yoshiko Holmes's thesis.\nLong ago, a man named Urashima Tar\u014d of unidentified profession (or, in recent textbooks often a fisherman) found a turtle on the beach being toyed with by a group of children. He purchased the turtle and released it in the ocean.\nTwo or three days later, while he was fishing on a boat as always, the grateful turtle came and told him he would carry him on his back to the underwater Dragon Palace (Ry\u016bg\u016b). At the palace, the princess (Otohime) thanked him for saving the turtle.After an unspecified number of days, remembrance of his mother and father made him homesick, and he bid farewell to Otohime. The princess tried to dissuade him from leaving, but finally let him go with a parting gift, a mysterious box called tamatebako whose lid he was told never to open.\n\nWhen Tar\u014d returned to his hometown, everything had changed. His home was gone, his mother and father had perished, and the people he knew were nowhere to be seen. Not remembering the princess's warning, he lifted the lid of the box. A cloud of white smoke arose, turning him to a  white-haired old man.\nThe story remained as one of the dozen tales included in the 4th edition of national language reader textbooks also known as Sakura tokuhon) used from 1933\u2013ca. 1940, thus continuing to enjoy wide recognition; for this reason Urashima could be considered one of the core stories of the so-called Japanese \"national fairy tales\".\n\n\n== School song ==\nThere are a number of renditions set to music. Among the most popular is the school song \"Urashima Tar\u014d\" (\u6d66\u5cf6\u592a\u90ce) of 1911 which begins with the line \"Mukashi, mukashi Urashima wa, tasuketa kame ni tsurerarete (Long long ago was Urashima, by the turtle he rescued taken to the sea)\", printed in the  Jinj\u014d sh\u014dgaku sh\u014dka (1911). This song's author was long relegated to anonymity, but the lyricist is now considered to be Okkotsu Sabur\u014d.Another school song \"Urashima Tar\u014d\" (\u3046\u3089\u3057\u307e\u305f\u308d\u3046, lyrics by Ishihara Wasabur\u014d and music by Tamura Toraz\u014d) appeared in the Y\u014dnen sh\u014dka (1900). Although written in stilted classical language, Miura considered this version the more familiar.\n\n\n== Otogiz\u014dshi ==\n\nLong before the versions in 19th century textbooks, there had been the otogi-z\u014dshi versions from the Muromachi period. Conventionally, commentators using the term otogiz\u014dshi are referring by default to the text found in the Otogi Bunko (or \"Companion Library\"), since it was printed and widely disseminated.\n\n\n=== Otogi Bunko ===\nIn the Otogi Bunko (or \"Companion Library\") version, a young fisherman named Urashima Tar\u014d catches a turtle on his fishing line and releases it. The next day, Urashima encounters a boat with a woman on it wishing to be escorted home. She does not identify herself, although she is the transformation of the turtle that was spared. When Urashima rows her boat to her magnificent residence, she proposes that they marry. The residence is the Dragon Palace, and on the four sides of the palace, each gardenscape is in a different season. Urashima decides to return to his home after three years and is given a memento box (\u304b\u305f\u307f\u306e\u7b65/\u7bb1, katami no hako) in parting. He arrives in his hometown to find it desolate, and discovers 700 years have passed since he last left it. He cannot restrain his temptation to open the box which he was cautioned not to open, whereupon three wisps of purple cloud appear and turn him into an old man. It ends with Urashima Tar\u014d transforming into a crane, and his wife reverting back to the form of a turtle, the two thereafter revered as my\u014djin (Shinto deities).\n\n\n=== Variants and groups ===\nThere are actually over 50 texts of the Urashima Tar\u014d otogi-z\u014dshi extant. These variants fall into four broad groups, clustered by their similarity. The Otogi Bunko text belongs to Group IV.\n\n\n=== Group closest to modern version ===\n\nThe Otogi Bunko version, despite its conventional status as the type text, differs considerably from the typical children's storybook published in the modern day: the protagonist neither purchases the turtle from others to save it, nor rides the turtle.Group I texts are more similar to the modern version, as it contains the element of Urashima purchasing the turtle to save it. Additionally, this group explicitly gives the princess's name as Otomime (or \"Kame-no-Otohime\") whereas she remains unnamed in the Otogi Bunko group. And the expression tamatebako or \"jeweled hand-box\" familiar to modern readers is also seen in the main text of Group I, and not the other groups (the interpolated poem excepted).The picture scroll in the collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford University also belongs to Group I.Hayashi Kouhei has highlighted the characteristics of the Group I texts as follows: 1) Urashima purchases a turtle caught by others, 2) Boat arrives to convey him to Horai, 3) The four seasons assuage rather than provoke his homesickness, 4) The villagers in recognition of his longevity give him proper cremation, 5) Smoke from tamatebako reach Horai and Princess Otohime is grief-stricken.\n\n\n== Other modern versions ==\n\n\n=== Seki's version in English ===\nThe tale of \"Urashima Taro\" in Keigo Seki's anthology (translated into English 1963), was a version told in Nakatado District, Kagawa. In this variant, Urashima is localized as being from \"Kitamae Oshima\". It incorporates both the motif of the turtle being caught while fishing, and that of Urashima transforming into a crane at the end, which are found in the Otogiz\u014dshi.\nHere, it was a three-tiered jeweled hand-box (\u4e09\u91cd\u306d\u306e\u7389\u624b\u7bb1, mitsugasane no tamatebako), that is to say, a stacked box that was given to Urashima. When he opened the lid, the first box (on the top) contained a crane's feather, and the second a puff of white smoke that turned him into an old man, and the third a mirror, which made him see for himself that he had suddenly grown old. The feather from the first box then attached itself to his back, and Urashima flew up to the sky, encircling his mother's grave.\n\n\n=== Versions retold in English ===\nThe story entitled \"The Fisher-boy Urashima\" (1886) retold by Basil Hall Chamberlain, was number 8 in the \"Japanese Fairy Tale Series\" printed by Hasegawa Takejir\u014d, the issuer of many such chirimen-bon or \"crepe-paper books\". Although the illustrations are not credited in the publication, they have been attributed to Kobayashi Eitaku.There is no single base text in Japanese identifiable, although it has been conjectured that Chamberlain adapted from \"a popular version\" and not straying far from it except adding explanatory or instructive passages for young readers. Others have determined it must have been a composite consisting of older traditions from the Nihon Shoki and Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, combined with the near-modern Otogiz\u014dshi storybook plot, Chamberlain preferring to incorporate details from the ancient texts, while eschewing embellishment from the Otogiz\u014dshi.In Chamberlain's version, \"Urashima\" (not \"Tar\u014d\") catches a tortoise (sic) while fishing on his boat, and releases it. The tortoise reappears in her true form as the Sea-God's daughter, and invites him to the Dragon Palace.There the couple are married and live happily for 3 years, but Urashima misses seeing his parents and his brothers. The Dragon Princess reluctantly allows him to leave, giving him a box he is instructed never to open, for it will cause him never to be able to return to the palace. When he returns to his home village, his absence turns out to have been 400 years. Urashima now wishes to go back to the Dragon Palace but he does not know the means, and opens the box. He turns into a white-haired, wrinkled old man and dies. The ending by death concurs with older tradition, and not the otogi-z\u014dshi storybook.Lafcadio Hearn, who lived in Japan and translated or adapted many ghost stories from the country, rewrote the Urashima tale under the title The Dream of a Summer Day in the late 19th century, working off of a copy of Chamberlain's \"Japanese Fairy Tale Series\" version.\n\n\n=== Variations ===\nAs always with folklore, there are many different versions of this story.\nThere are other versions that add a further epilogue explaining the subsequent fate of Urashima Tar\u014d after he turns into an old man. In one, he falls to dust and dies, in another, he transforms into a crane and flies up to the sky. In another, he grows gills and leaps into the sea, whereby he regains his youth.In another version Urashima ate a magic pill that gave him the ability to breathe underwater. In another version, he is swept away by a storm before he can rescue the turtle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe full name Urashima Tar\u014d was not given to the character until the 15th century (the Muromachi period), first appearing in a genre of illustrated popular fiction known as otogiz\u014dshi, and in the ky\u014dgen play adaptation.The story itself can be found in much older sources, dating to the 8th century (the Nara period), where the protagonist is styled either \"Urashima no ko\" or \"Ura (no) Shimako\", attested in earlier sources such as the Fudoki for Tango Province (Tango no Kuni Fudoki, \u4e39\u5f8c\u56fd\u98a8\u571f\u8a18) that survived in excerpts, the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and the Nihon Shoki.More recent editions of these texts tend to favor the \"Ura (no) Shimako\" reading, although some consider this debatable.It has also been proposed that it was not until the Heian Period that the misreading \"Urashima (no) ko\" became current, because names with the suffix -ko (\"child\") came to be regarded as female, even though it once applied to either gender. When the texts were written for the ky\u014dgen theatre, the character's name underwent further change to Urashima Tar\u014d, with -tar\u014d (\"great youth\") being a common suffix in male names. Or perhaps the name was borrowed from Tar\u014d kaja who is a stock character in ky\u014dgen.\n\n\n=== Dragon Palace ===\nThe Man'y\u014dsh\u016b ballad mentions not only the woman of the Immortal Land, but her father as the Sea God (Watatsumi). Although this Sea God cannot be automatically equated with the Dragon God or Dragon King, due to the influence of the Chinese mythology of Nine Offspring of the Dragon in the Tang period, it has been speculated that the turtle princess must have been the Dragon King's daughter in even those early versions.The otherworld Urashima visited was not the \"Dragon Palace\" (Ry\u016bg\u016b) until the otogi-z\u014dshi versions appeared. The heroine then became Otohime, the younger daughter of the Dragon King.\n\n\n=== Relative dates ===\nAs for the relative dating of these texts, an argument has been advanced that places the Fudoki version as the oldest. The argument dates the Tango fudoki to shortly after 715, but the compilers refer to an earlier record by Iyobe no Umakai, which was identical in content. It has even been suggested by Sh\u016bichi Kat\u014d that this Umakai originally adapted this tale into Japanese from a similar Chinese tale.\n\n\n== Tango Fudoki ==\n\nIn this version, the protagonist is referred to as \"Urashimako of Mizunoe\" (or \"Urashimako of Tsutsukawa in Yosa-gun\".\nUrashimako catches a five-coloured turtle and keeps it in his boat, and during his sleep, the creature transforms into a beautiful woman. She identifies herself as someone from the household of immortals, and proposes to take him to the place of immortals, which may be Horaisan (Mount Penglai) or \"Tokoyo-no-kuni\" (\"Timeless Land\" or \"Land of Eternity\").They are greeted by first seven, then eight children, who represent the constellations of Pleiades and Taurus (or more precisely the Hyades cluster) who address him as the \"husband of Kame Hime (Princess Turtle)\". The remainder is mostly the same as the typical tale.After three years, the man develops a longing for his parents and homeland. The princess is saddened, but imparts him with a jeweled comb box (tamakushige, \u7389\u5323), forbidding him to open it if he wished ever to return to her. He returns and finds no trace of his home or family, except that he is remembered as a man who disappeared long ago, and would be over three hundred years old if still alive. Forgetting the promise, he opens the box, whereupon a beautiful figure like a fragrant orchid is carried away to the heavens with the clouds, and he realizes he can never meet the princess again. Still, the couple are somehow (supernaturally) able to exchange poems. These poems are recorded in phonetic man'y\u014dgana.\n\n\n== Nihon Shoki ==\nIn the Nihon Shoki, Urashimako of Mizunoe is mentioned in the entry for Autumn, 7th month the 22nd year of reign of Emperor Y\u016bryaku. Aston's translation assigns this the year 478 A.D. The entry states that Urashimako (child Urashima, child of Urashima, etc.) of Mizunoe while fishing on a boat, caught a turtle which transformed into a woman. They went into the sea, and reached Mount H\u014drai (glossed in kana as Tokoyo), where they saw immortals (\u4ed9\u8846 (\u3072\u3058\u308a)).As to the phrase that they go \"into the sea\" implies, the Mount H\u014drai as conceived here may be a submarine island, a suggestion made by Japanese literature professor \u014ckuma Kiichir\u014d.\n\n\n== Manyoshu ==\nA poem reflecting upon the legend of Urashima of Mizunoe occurs in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. The piece is ascribed to Takahashi no Mushimaro. Early translations include the prose rendition by Aston, and the ballad-form by Chamberlain.In this version, the woman of the Immortal Land (Tokoyo) appears as the daughter of the Sea God (Watatsumi no kami).\n\n\n== Localizations ==\n\n\n=== Yokohama ===\n\nBasil Hall Chamberlain (1880) indicated the presence of a temple dedicated to Urashima at Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, which housed several relics such as Urashima's fishing-line, and the casket (tamatebako). But when Ernest Satow went there with Chamberlain on 2 May 1880, there was nothing left to see except the statue of Kannon (Kanzeon), the goddess of mercy.Neither recorded the name to the temple, but Japanese sources write that the so-called Urashima-dera (Urashima Temple) used to be  Kanpuku-ji (\u89b3\u798f\u5bfa), until it burned down in 1868, and the temple, including the Kannon goddess statue got translated to Keiun-ji (\u6176\u904b\u5bfa) in 1872.The old Urashima-dera sat on a mountain top. There is a circulating pamphlet which shows the view of the harbor from this vantage point, depicting the fleet of Black Ships led by Commodore Perry's fleet in 1852\u20131854.Local legend also claims native ties to Urashima Tar\u014d, claiming that his father Urashima Tay\u016b was originally from somewhere not far from Yokohama, in Miura District, Kanagawa in Sagami Province. But the father moved to \nTango Province. This legend adds that when Urashima Tar\u014d returned from the Dragon Place, he was guided to seek his parents' grave in \"Shirahata, Musashi Province\" (in today's Yokohama).\nHe finally found the grave, thanks to Princess Oto-hime who lit up an illuminating light on a pine branch. Tar\u014d built a hut to live here, housing the goddess statue from the Dragon Palace. The hut later became Kampuku-ji temple.\n\n\n=== Okinawa ===\nChamberlain noted the theory that the Dragon Palace might be a romanticized notion of Okinawa, since \"Ry\u016bg\u016b\" (Dragon Palace) and Ry\u016bky\u016b (Okinawa) are near homophones.Recorded in Ir\u014d setsuden (\u907a\u8001\u8aac\u4f1d, \"Accounts Left by Oldmen\") of the 18th century, Tale 103 \"A person of Yonaha village visits the Dragon Palace\" is considered analogous to Urashima Tar\u014d. In it, a certain man of Yonaha village in Haebaru finds a lock of black hair and returns it to a beautiful maiden. She leads him to the Dragon Palace. Three months pass and the man wishes to return, but the goddess reveals 33 generations have already passed in his absence. The man receives a folded-up piece of paper he is forbidden from unwrapping, but he opens this packet and a piece of white hair clings to him, turning him into an old man, and he dies. He was enshrined at the place which was named Usani-daki, because the man had \"sat and reposed\" (usani) in his despair.Similar tales are found on Miyako-jima and other places. Yanagita Kunio felt that the notion of the Dragon Palace shared its origin with the concept of Niruya (Niraikanai) in the southerly islands of Japan.Ir\u014d setsuden also records a similar tale, number 42, about Yoshinawa Fuyako (\u5584\u7e04\u5927\u5c4b\u5b50), which describes a man who, bidden by a mysterious woman appeared before him, carried a large turtle to his home, which bit and gave him a terrible wound so that he was buried. But he turned out not to have died a mortals death, and lived on.\n\n\n=== Kiso, Nagano ===\n\nLocal legend has it that Urashima Tar\u014d once dwelled in the mountains of Kiso, Nagano. This legend originated in near-modern times, from the late Muromachi to Edo periods.Although a contrived piece of fiction, the old-style j\u014druri Urashima Tar\u014d (\u300e\u6d66\u5d8b\u592a\u90ce\u300f) situates its story in the vicinity of this local legend, namely Agematsu-juku. Urashima Tar\u014d appears here as a child born after a local couple prays to Togakushi My\u014djin. He and Tamayori-hime fall in love. She is very much a mortal, but after she commits suicide in Ina River (tributary of Kiso River), she becomes transformed into a supernatural being serving the Dragon Palace. A scale cloak lets her transform into a turtle, in which guise, she is reunited with Urashima Tar\u014d who is fishing in Ina River. Note the \"catching of the turtle\" scene is transposed from ocean to a river in the mountains.\n\n\n== Comparative mythology ==\nThe story bears varying degrees of similarity to folktales from other cultures. Rip Van Winkle is the foremost familiar example, although strictly speaking this cannot be called a \"folktale\", since it is a fictional work by Washington Irving loosely based on folklore. Nevertheless, Urashima has been labeled the \"Japanese Rip van Winkle\", even in academic folkloristic literature. \"Urashima\" is also a Japanese metaphor similar to \"Rip Van Winkle\" for someone who feels lost in a world that has changed in their absence.This pair of tales may not be the closest matching among the motif group. Writing in the 19th century, Lafcadio Hearn suggested that Irving wrote another piece called \"The Adelantado of the Seven Cities\", based on Portuguese tradition, which bore an even stronger resemblance to Urashima. Japanese art collector William Anderson also wrote that a certain Chinese tale was closer to \"Rip Van Winkle\" than Urashima was.That Chinese analogue is the anecdote of the woodcutter Wang Zhi, who after watching immortals playing a board game discovers many years have passed. The piece is a selection in the Shuyiji or \"Accounts of Strange Things\", and is also known as the legend of Lankeshan or \"Rotten Axe Handle Mountain\". Sometimes this Chinese tale is conjectured as a possible actual source for Urashima, but there is lack of consensus among folklorists regarding their interrelationship.Other cognate tales include the Irish legend of Ois\u00edn who met Niamh and spent his life with her in T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, and the Vietnamese legend of T\u1eeb Th\u1ee9c, who aids a fairy-child arrested for plucking a peony flower during the festivities. In both these cases, the hero is united with a fairy woman who dwells in a land beyond the sea. T\u1eeb Th\u1ee9c's story is collected in Truy\u1ec1n k\u1ef3 m\u1ea1n l\u1ee5c by Nguy\u1ec5n D\u1eef.\nThe tale of Urashima Taro holds many similarities with tales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther index ATU 681, \"The Relativity of Time\". A similar story is The Marsh King's Daughter, a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nA shrine on the western coast of the Tango Peninsula in northern Kyoto Prefecture, named Urashima Jinja, contains an old document describing a man, Urashimako, who left his land in 478 A.D. and visited a land where people never die. He returned in 825 A.D. with a Tamatebako. Ten days later he opened the box, and a cloud of white smoke was released, turning Urashimako into an old man. Later that year, after hearing the story, Emperor Junna ordered Ono no Takamura to build a shrine to commemorate Urashimako's strange voyage, and to house the Tamatebako and the spirit of Urashimako.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe animated adaptation Urashima Tar\u014d of the tale, premiered in 1918, is among some of the oldest anime created in Japan, the same year that Oz author Ruth Plumly Thompson adapted it as \"Urashima and the Princess of the Sea\" for The Philadelphia Public Ledger.The story influenced various works of fiction and a number of films. In 1945, Japanese writer Osamu Dazai published Otogiz\u014dshi (\"fairytale book\"), which includes a much expanded version of the story. Urashima's tale, as the other three included in the Otogiz\u014dshi, is used mostly as a platform for Dazai's own thoughts and musings. Ursula K. Le Guin's short story \"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea\" (or \"Another Story\", 1994) is a reconcoction of the Urashima story set in the Ekumen or Hainish universe.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTamatebako, an origami cube that causes the aging of Urashima Tar\u014d in some versions of the story.\nLankeshan ji\nYuri's Brush with Magic by Maureen Wartski, a young adult novel that integrates the Urashima Taro myth into narrative.\nIsekai, an anime and manga genre that has roots in the Urashima Tar\u014d story.\nPandora's box, a magic box which spread disaster when opened in Greek mythology.\nKing asleep in mountain, several legends of people hidden away in time.\n\"Rip Van Winkle\"\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\nKakudmi and Revati\nHerla\nOis\u00edn\nThe Voyage of Bran\nIara (mythology)\nUrashima effect, another name for time dilation in the theory of relativity.\nHoni ha-M'agel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMcKeon, Midori Yamamoto. \"The Transformation of the Urashima Legend: The Influence of Religion on Gender.\" U.S.-Japan Women's Journal.

        "wiki": "\u014csanbashi Pier (\u5927\u3055\u3093\u6a4b, \u014dsanbashi, pronounced [o\u02d0samba\u0255i]) is the main international passenger pier at the Port of Yokohama, located in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan.  \u014csanbashi is the oldest pier in Yokohama, originally constructed between 1889 and 1896.\nMajor cruise ships such as the Queen Elizabeth 2 were at one time embarked here, although 90,000 GWT ships such as MS Queen Elizabeth are often obliged to use nearby container terminals owing to their enormous size.  The pier is also known as one of the best places to see the Yokohama Three Towers (The King, Queen and the Jack)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Port of Yokohama was opened in 1859 as a direct result of the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, and the Ansei Treaties signed between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Russia. Yokohama grew rapidly as a treaty port and commercial center due to its proximity to Tokyo, natural deep water harbour and protection from strong winds by the Honmoku bluff.\nInitially the port only offered two small stone wharfs for visiting ships, built on the current site of the modern \u014csanbashi Pier.  The two wharfs, known as the French and English Hatoba, were too shallow for the ocean going ships to dock, and so barges were used to carry passengers and freight to and from the ships in the outer harbour.  In 1894, the Japanese government provided funding for an extended steel pier to replace the English Hatoba.  Designed by British engineer, Henry Spencer Palmer, the new pier was able to accommodate up to four ships simultaneously.Although the pier was repaired and enlarged several times, it survived the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, and the bombing raids of World War II largely intact.  During the occupation the pier was renamed South Pier and remained under occupation forces control until 1952.\nIn 1964, a reconstruction of \u014csanbashi Passenger Terminal was completed in time before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\n== Current pier ==\n\nTo meet modern demands, \u014csanbashi Pier was again reconstructed between 1988 and 2002.  The newly reconstructed passenger terminal is named the Yokohama International Passenger Terminal, designed by Foreign Office Architects (Alejandro Zaera-Polo and Farshid Moussavi), the pier was the subject of a major international design competition attracting over 660 entries.  The new pier can accommodate up to four 30,000-ton class ships or two 70,000-ton class ships at the same time.  The departure/arrival lobby, ticketing booth, customs, immigration, large multipurpose hall, shops and cafe are all on the 2nd floor of this terminal. There is a parking facility on the 1st floor, and an extensive, gently curving observation deck with planted grass areas, open to the public on the rooftop.\nThe Port and City of Yokohama developed other renovation and construction projects in the waterfront area, such as the Minato Mirai 21 project, in this time frame.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWorld Architecture Survey\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSakamoto, Tomoko.

          "We arrived by taxi to the entrance to the Terminal. There was a line of porters with luggage carts waiting on the outside of the terminal to collect the luggage from the difference vehicles upon arrival. The port has a series of large buildings. The Terminal that we were",
          "As others have said, a unique pier for sure. I think the best part is that from either standing on the dock, or within a 5 minute walk - you can get great pictures of the city and some of its historic buildings. Many photographers and pros milling around the dock area for great",
          "This is a nice port to sail from. We did Diamond Princess. Not sure who else sails from this terminal, but Diamond Princess seems to be the main one. TheY offer internet, which is a plus.",
          "My wife and I have just had an excellent cruise holiday in Japan. We have been to many cruise holidays to many parts of the world but this was the first time we cruised around Japan. We were very impressed by the services provided by the Osanbashi International Passenger",
          "Without a doubt the nicest cruise terminal ever that has grass on top. The whole deck is teak and undulates in an amazing way. Boarding and disembarkation was seamless. Love this cruise terminal.",
          "There is a part of me that looks at this and finds it an exciting and alternative bit of architecture that I really like. There is another part that remembers the long slopes and the difficulty in keeping control of luggage trolleys on them. I remember just how dark it felt",
          "The 360\u00b0 view from Osanbashi's rooftop deck is very nice at any time of the day. The wooden deck has an interesting design.",
          "This park offers wonderful night time views of the Yokohama Bay and close up of the beautiful cruise ships that stayed overnight. The surrounding areas and skylines are quite striking. There is a free shuttle from the pier to Sakuragicho JR station when cruise ships are docked.",
          "This cruise port is designed to blend with the environment so that you don't really see it until you are close to it. Almost exotic looking. Unfortunately, the inside is not as attractive and it is barn-like in atmosphere. We waited for a few hours on uncomfortable chairs",
          "We have sailed from here many times. Boarding has been very efficient every time. Hotel to terminal is a short cab ride. Staff take thed baggage straight from you.",
          "The Terminal is only about ten minutes by taxi from the closest train station, the JR Sakuragicho Station, and people can walk right up to the Terminal building. The City Government runs a free one-way shuttle bus service from the Terminal to Sakuragicho Station to facilitate",

          "Actually took a dry run to this terminal the night before we boarded our cruise. The night view of the harbor was pretty amazing. Our ship was not due to arrive until the next morning. Not a large terminal. We were able to explore the interior and got a sense of bearing",

          "We embarked on a cruise ship here and didn't find the experience to be anything special. It was no more efficient than other terminals where we've embarked. What is unique about this terminal is that the roof is covered with grass, making it into sort of a park. From the",

          "We came here twice on the cruise ship and must say that embarking was a bit of a trial compared to the disembarking There are little signs from the train station to the port (dependant on which train station that you use) and when we asked the locals about cruise terminal or",

          "I do recommend a visit, simply due to the architecture of the pier itself. It's made like a wooden ship, stretching far into the Yokohama harbour bay area. Not much to do besides strolling along the pier. Sometimes there are festivals. If you go, then you do it for the view",

          "Easy access here and traffice pre-boarding wasn't too bad. Staff all very helpful and a few small shops on the pier.",

          "We have seen a lot of piers all over the world but never one like this, the boardwalk is made of beautiful wood in a rolling ocean wave type of architecture and there is a lot of grassy area also , very interesting",
          "At first I visited this port three years ago and I liked it very much. Interesting architecture, open space. The second time I was visited this place a week ago and I was surprised that there are so many barriers. I can understand that maybe some people could stumble if they",
          "We were very pleased with the architecture of the terminal building--wonderful feel and appropriate for the ocean setting. The inside is a little dark and not all that inviting, The shops are limited. The bus drop off point is very congested and it is hard to \"go against",
          "The timber deck was quite unexpected, extending across the top of the Passenger terminal. At the far end of the pier you can look back to the Minato Mirai 21 skyline, and on a clear day can see Mt Fuji in the distance. Plenty of the iconic Japanese vending machines on the",
          "I stayed at this port for a little while after visiting the renewed area of the warehouses and this is a very lovely place. Modern architecture and beautiful spaces make this place a must visit while in Yokohama. Cruises and boats may be seen from here, and the bay looks indeed",
          "Yokohama was the last stop on our recent cruise. The terminal was very to get through. Very clean and with its neat architecture many people would walk/jog around the top of the terminal. Its location is perfect for exploring Yokohama itself and very close to the Nihon-Odori",
          "We left from here to go on a cruise. It appears to be brand new...great design and apparently the place to see and be seen. Lots of people watching the ships, walking dogs and enjoying the day. The boarding was a bit chaotic but it had nothing to do with the pier at all....",
          "You v=can walk on stop of this structure and take photos, or walk around it or simple sit and relax. Great view of the rainbow bridge and of the Yokohama City. If your lucky, you can catch a movie being made here or a commercial or ad photo shoot being made.",
          "Everywhere in Japan is so clean, and they area is no exception. They did an amazing job building this terminal. Its closed to the Red Warehouse, and close to walk to the park from the pier.",
          "We disembarked a cruise ship here. It is a large building with good facilities. There is plenty of room inside and out for passengers and visitors. It is easy to find a taxi or a bus. There is a very good view from the top of the building and very nicely designed",
          "We arrived here on the Norwegian Jewel and found it to be very congested for passengers collecting luggage and trying to get taxis. It is a very long warehouse type of building with a contoured roof with grass and boardwalks that is used for public events and viewing the cruise",
          "What a great facility, probably only rivalled by KaiTak at Hong Kong. Easy to get in and out of. Nice open public areas, and very close to downtown.",
          "We managed to catch a bus from Haneda airport and then a short taxi drive from the railway terminal to Osanbashi port. The taxi ride was short and pricey, but obviously not as expensive as is we had taken it all the way from Haneda some 40 miles away. As we neared the port",
          "Our cruise ship docked at this Port and the first thing you notice is the jogging track on top of the building. As with so much of Japan, the architecture is amazing. It can be a very busy and crowded Terminal but it seems that there are so many people walking around assisting",

          "This is one of the best spots in Yokohama especially during the evening hours with all the lighting and illumination in the Minato Mirai area. Its a passenger terminal for ships , ferry with a viewing deck on the top offering great views of the bay and the surrounding area.",
          "We were cruising from here a couple of days later and decided to go \"look see\". There were very few people about so it was easy to look round the place even though the wind was blowing and it was quite cool. There were good views all round.",
          "If this structure isn't in an architectural coffee table book, it ought to be. It's as if elements of ship architecture were borrowed to create a non-traditional wood building that serves as a public park and international cruise ship terminal jutting into the Yokohama harbor.",
          "Great views of Yokohama Harbour. If you are having a stopover here the local \u201cRed Shoe\u201d hop on hop off bus goes straight through the terminal.",
          "Beautiful few from there also the area looks really nice and we saw Mount Fuji what a perfect last day in Japan",
          "I made this one of my stops in Yokohama as I love great architecture. The angled railings complement the sturdy wooden deck with Katakana graphic design and landscaping. The pier has a lot of crows flying around, so do be wary of dropping small sized belongings and food. You",
          "There\u2019s not a lot to \u2018do\u2019 at Osanbashi Pier, but it really is a great piece of architecture. Even though the weather was miserable and it was cold from the winds when I visited, I really enjoyed walking along the curves and steps of this pier. On a clear day, it\u2019ll have a great",
          "This port it has a very unique architecture/wood surface to walk on. Wonderful view of the harbor. They\u2019re in back from there Kannai is about a 4 mile walk.",
          "Free entry (at least to the rooftop), so can not beat the price. I went watching the sunrise and it was worth it (though the planks are extremely slippery when wet in early morning even without ice, so one must be extremely careful on slopes). Nice view of skyline and I expected",
          "This is a must see if you are in Yokohama. The Osanbashi is a giant, contemporary looking pier in the middle of Yokohama Bay. Great views of Minato Mirai and the surrounding area. Inside the pier there are a number of restaurants, cafes, and gift shops, and they even have free",
          "My husband dragged me along to this site and I wasn't happy bit after visiting I understand why he wanted to see this building, it's amazing and I can imagine in the summer months it would be solace to spend a leisurely afternoon.",

          "Great cruise port, effortless embarkation and customs process. Drop off Parking easy, close to main entrance",
          "Quite a really nice view here. You can see the port and look back to Yokohama city. Ther are many couple take their wedding photo here. Bring your jacket cause it's kinda strong wind for me. The view in the afternoon is also when the sun slowly get down behind Yokohama city.",
          "Our cruise ship had two stops in Yokohama, and the convenience of the Osanbashi terminal made the visits even more enjoyable. The staff inside the terminal were very friendly, and the vicinity to the warehouses and shops in town was also nice. The artistic design of the exterior",

          "Amazing place... it's not only works as international port, but also a tourist attraction. From on the top of it you can see an amazing view of Red Brick House, minato mirai 21, yamashita park, and Yokohama bridge. I think it would be a great place to visit during sunset or",

          "A great place to chill out on a warm afternoon. The view is great and you can watch the ships in the harbor. Some small vendors sell beer and basic food and there is also a very good restaurant, Sub Zero, below the pier, which also has a panoramic view of Yokohama.",

          "The Big Wharf is a must see (or better, must step there) if you happen to stop by Yokohama. An unconventional shape, build on wood, with the occasional newlywed couple stopping by to take memorable pictures. The view is breathtaking, both of the city side and of the Yokohama",
          "This is the international cruise ship dock. Some famous architect built it, and as docks go, it's pretty cool. Not at all worth a trip by itself, it's worth walking out on as part of a larger trip to the Minato-Mirai / Yamashita Koen area.",
          "It's a very interesting place - transforming passenger terminal to a futuristic architectural art work. I was quite impressed w/ creativity and beauty. Size of Osanbashi was huge and massive - yet could be a quite romantic place.",
          "We got a good laugh out of the sign at the bottom of the ramp up which noted not to go barefoot due to the prickles. Using the translation app we have on our phones, we determined they meant splinters! There is a lot of wood involved in the construction of this terminal/platform",

          "Looks really great on photo but not much to do. No cafe, souvenir shop or museum. About 15 minute walk or 450 meters from Minatomirai Mirai where I stayed. Visit this together with Red Brick warehouse as they are just across each other.",

          "My favorite place in the city. Lots of open space with no oppressive power cables overhead. Watch the boats come and go and get a great panorama view of the city and bay. Great place when the weather is nice. Not much shade so on a sunny day, bring a hat! Very interesting",
          "Superb view, including Minatomirai and Mt. Fuji. Fine architecture. Visiting during sunset would be ideal.",

          "We walked on the pier and found it very nice. I think you need to walk it to understand it, it somehow fits with the see/port context very well. Even if there were no ships to be watched around when we went, it was a nice experience.",

          "I loved the innovative style for a pier / boat dock with arrival / departure building. The effect of all the untreated wood is very different and some cool seating too.",
          "This is a great walk to do to, beware that if it is windy you will have a terrible time though. We decided to walk the pier after visiting the red brick shop. The way that the pier is shape is really neat, and it offers some pretty easy walking and offers great views of the bay",
          "I spent the entire day in Yokohama with friends and this was a very memorable experience. the Pier is wonderful and one of a kind; all wood plank and very long. An amazing date spot, whether you're in Yokohama or Tokyo (a short 30 min, 400 yen trip away). I didn't go inside the",
          "Great design of the terminal along with friendly staff to assist. There is ample signage around to get you to the nearest metro station if you wish to go to Tokyo which is a few minutes walk away and will take you about 21 stops to shibuya directly . At night is a wonderful area",
          "Looks almost like a futuristic ship itself. Great views all round and a very cool shipping passenger terminal.",
          "The pier is easy to get to by bus or taxi (although the taxi was more convenient with luggage). There is free WiFi on the pier. The location is good, within walking distance from the red brick warehouses, the train station, and a large drug store at the end of the pier, across",
          "We embarked on our first cruise from Yokohama and were very disappointed that it took 3 hours from the time we arrived to the time we walked on to the ship. Unfortunately the terminal just doesn't seem equipped to handle large numbers of passengers. The location is convenient,",
          "as I'm architect by profession visiting Osanbashi pier while we were in Yokohama was a must see/ must do thing for me... And it was really great experience! Truly great work of modern architecture... with some really new and ground breaking ideas and solutions... and seem to me",
          "Very interesting architecture, although totally dwarfed by our cruise ship. Several boutiques and souvenir shops within the terminal which were open quite late into the evening",
          "This is mainly built to handle the cruise ships that dock in Yokohama. And like all things Japanese does it with great efficiency, courtesy and friendliness. The building itself is almost a work of art that seems to flow. It offers numerous places for visitors to view the",
          "Osanbashi terminal has superb design and excellent location at harbour front. When I arrived by the taxi, some workers come to collect my luggages and sendit to the Diamond Princess Cruise immediately. I took only 10 Mins to finish my check in process. And then I go up to the",
          "The actual pier is not an attraction as it stands, but it does have value if you want to get away from life for a while. The stroll along the pier on a warm sunny day is peaceful and relaxing, with good views of the surrounding water frontage and has easy access to other parts",
          "As I am a retired carpenter, the decking on this pier is a work of art and also encompassed shops, restaurants and good parking - worth a visit even if not going on a cruise",

          "Boarded the Diamond Princess cruise from here. Epitome of Japanese efficiency and order. Very large embarkation hall. They were able to handle 3000 of us passenger with ease. Very quick check in and check out when we disembarked. Abundant taxis and buses available to Haneda or",

          "The pier and it's area are beautifully designed. The pier itself looks like giant ship or wave structure. Wood and white colours are simple, leaving room for multi-faceted construction. It gives overall impression of simplicity and filling in surrounding sea. Nice place for a",
          "This is probably one of my favorite places in Yokohama. I highly recommend going both during the day and at night for unbeatable views of the skyline. Osanbashi is a nice place to sit and reflect at the end of the day, so don't schedule anything for after your visit here if you",
          "Pleasant walk with good views of Yokohama Bay and attractive area to rest a while. The model of Yokohama Bay area inside the departure hall building was well done and interesting as were the models of different ships using the port over the years.",
          "Yokohama, the port city is very walkable and it's easy to get to from a direct Tokyo subway. WIth its port background and walkability its easy to visit all the sites as you cross bridge after bridge. One particular one that takes just that bit more time due to its size is",

          "Finally got chance to visit here.Not too far from the station,walk along the street then you can see it right before. The better way to enjoy is the night view from the brigde, can have the whole picture of the Minatomirai.Just take my time to have a nice talk with friends.",
          "It's worth visiting Osanbashi Pier to see the extensive timber decking, quite amazing really. You can walk out to the end and visit shops offering plenty of souvenirs for the tourist. It is a very large area giving you good views back to Yamashita Park and across Yokohama Bay.",
          "Quiet an impressive pier, with great views of the city and the bay. Also, plenty of places to sit, with seating to either watch a sunrise or sunset from the pier. Looked like an underground terminal, international terminal, I think it was called, but I didn't go in. Nice breeze",

          "Who expects a cruise terminal to be beautiful? The wooden floors and ramps are soothing to the feet (the boards have a springiness that reduced stress on your feet) and to the eyes. You can wander around and up to an open air area where locals like to spend their lunch time.",

        "wiki": "The Hara Model Railway Museum (\u539f\u9244\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u535a\u7269\u9928, Hara Tetsud\u014d Mokei Hakubutsukan) is a model railway museum in Nishi-ku, Yokohama, Japan, which opened on 10 July 2012. Managed by Mitsui Fudosan, the museum houses the extensive collection of model trains built and amassed by the Japanese model railway enthusiast Nobutaro Hara (\u539f \u4fe1\u592a\u90ce, Hara Nobutar\u014d). The museum covers an area of approximately 1,700 m\u00b2, with the display area covering an area of approximately 1,200 m\u00b2.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nApproximately 1,000 items from Hara's private collection of more than 6,000 model railway items are on display. The centrepiece of the museum is a 30-metre x 10 metre diorama called \"Ichiban Tetsumo Park\" (\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u30c6\u30c4\u30e2\u30d1\u30fc\u30af) which features \"1 gauge\" (45 mm gauge) model trains from around the world, and has approximately 450 metres of track. The layout features working overhead lines to power trains via their pantographs. The collection also includes the original models of Thomas the Tank Engine and several of the other characters from the production of Thomas & Friends prior to 2009 when the show was switched to CGI animation, some of which occasionally operate on the layout.Exhibits on display include models in 1 gauge (45 mm gauge, 1/32 scale), 0 gauge, and H0 gauge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was unveiled to the news media on 20 June 2012 ahead of its public opening on 10 July.\n\n\n== Nobutaro Hara ==\nThe owner of the collection, Nobutaro Hara, was born in Tokyo on 4 April 1919, and built his first model train at the age of 13. He studied mechanical engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. After World War II, Hara worked as a development engineer for the office equipment company Kokuyo. In his spare time, he continued to build and collect model trains, travelling to some 380 different countries and building up a collection of over 6,000 items. Over the years, he received a number of invitations from museums to exhibit his models, but always refused. He finally agreed to lend part of his collection to Mitsui Fudosan because the museum was located in Yokohama, the terminal of Japan's first railway, from Shimbashi in Tokyo. Hara died on 5 July 2014 at the age of 95.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe museum is located on the second floor of the Yokohama Mitsui Building in Nishi-ku, Yokohama, and is a two-minute walk from Shin-Takashima Station on the Minatomirai Line, and a five-minute walk from Yokohama Station.\n\n\n=== Address ===\n1-1-2 Takashima, Nishi-ku, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa-ken\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

        "wiki": "The Nissan Tiida is a compact car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Nissan since 2004, spanning two generations.\nFor the first generation of Tiida manufactured between 2004 and 2012, the series is designated C11 and was sold as a five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. This model straddled the subcompact and compact car segments. It retailed in North America as Nissan Versa, in parts of South America as Dodge Trazo, and in Southeast Asia for the sedan only under the title Nissan Latio. The C11 bridged the subcompact and compact car classes, acting as an intermediate model between the smaller Micra/March and larger Bluebird Sylphy and Sentra models within the global Nissan portfolio. Therefore, depending on the market, the C11 replaced different models and engrossed different segments. For example, in Japan the Tiida replaced the Nissan Sunny (B15) in Nissan's lineup as the smallest sedan. In most markets it slotted between the March and Bluebird Sylphy; for North America it became a new entry-level model below the Sentra; and elsewhere Tiida tended to occupy the role performed previously by the Nissan Almera/Pulsar/Sentra/Sunny (N16), sold in Japan as the Bluebird Sylphy (G10). The G10/N16's successor, the Bluebird Sylphy G11 was not widely sold outside Japan. The C11 started to be phased out in China first, during 2011 when partially replaced by the larger, compact class C12 Tiida/Pulsar hatchback. In 2012, the C11 began to be withdrawn from more markets as its main production bases ceased manufacture. The C11 was also replaced by the subcompact Nissan Note or Versa Note (E12) hatchback, and on the sedan fronts, by the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17).\nNissan introduced a second generation of Tiida, the five-door hatchback C12 series in 2011 to the Chinese market. Starting in 2013, sales began in Thailand, then Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 represents a departure from the C11, increasing its dimensions to comfortably occupy the compact class. Nissan Tiida also called \"Patrida car\". The development was anchored with the Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17) which is effectively the sedan version of the C12.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Tiida\" is from the Okinawan language and means \"sun\", continuing the naming tradition started in 1966 with the Nissan Sunny.\n\n\n== First generation (C11; 2004) ==\n\nNissan revealed the C-Note concept car in 2003 to preview the styling of the upcoming Nissan Tiida (C11). It is a concept hatchback based on the same platform of the Renault M\u00e9gane. It included bright beige color interior. The vehicle was unveiled in the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show.The Tiida hatchback and the Tiida Latio sedan debuted in 2004 in Japan, and in some European countries in 2007. It is based on a stretched-wheelbase variant of the Nissan B platform, and was manufactured as a five-door hatchback and a four-door sedan. The engine range included 1.5-, 1.6- and 1.8-liter gasoline engines and a 1.5-liter diesel engine.\nIn January 2008, Nissan introduced facelifted versions of both the hatchback and the sedan. They were enhanced with some key changes including new exterior features and interior designs, retuned power steering, powertrain enhancements and a new Plus navi HDD package called CarWings in Japan.\nThe exterior features a new grille, front bumper, headlights, taillights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports a more modern look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish dash panels.\nEngines include a 1.5-liter or 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, the larger of which can be coupled to a six-speed manual transmission. There are also two optional dealer packages: the Nismo S-tune Aero Package and Nismo Performance Package.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nAsia\n\nIn mainland China, the Tiida is produced by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture between Nissan and a local company. In Taiwan it is produced by Yulon.\nIn Malaysia, the first generation Tiida was sold as the Latio and available with in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The sedan was simply known as Latio while the hatchback was known as the Latio Sport. Unveiled in May 2007 and available in June 2007, fours variants were initially offered for the sedan bodystyle: 1.6 ST (M), 1.6 ST (A), 1.6 ST-L (A), 1.8 Ti (A). The hatchback was available in a sole 1.6 ST-L (A) variant. In April 2008, a limited 'Tuned By Impul' edition was available for both variants. The 'Tuned By Impul' edition featured a bodykit, sports suspension, different exhaust system and different alloy wheels. In September 2011, the facelift version of Latio reduced the variant count to just two. A sole 1.6 variant for the sedan and a sole 1.8 variant for the hatchback.\n\nIn Singapore, the Tiida and Tiida Latio were initially sold alongside the older and cheaper Sunny N16 and the bigger and more expensive Sylphy.\nIn Indonesia, the Tiida 1.8 hatchback was marketed for private use, while the 1.6 sedan was for taxi fleet only.\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiida was used as a police car by the Hong Kong police. Some were police patrol cars whereas some were airport police cars.\nIn Taiwan, both Tiida hatchback and Tiida sedan are produced by Yulon Motors. The Tiida sedan was still in production until May 2018.\nEuropeIn 2007, the first European countries began receiving imports of the Tiida. Although it has not been officially launched in the United Kingdom, some cars destined for the Irish market have been sold in the UK as gray imports.\nNorth AmericaThe Versa was introduced in the United States and Canada in July 2006 as a 2007 model. North and Latin American models of the Tiida use a DOHC 1.8-liter gasoline engine and are assembled at Nissan's Aguascalientes, Mexico assembly plant. It is also the only Nissan four-door passenger car in the United States and Canada to be sold worldwide, since the Sentra, Altima and Maxima are exclusive to North America.\nAccording to a Nissan press release in 2008, \"versa\" is short for \"versatile space\" meant to imply the spaciousness of the interior and configurable cargo arrangements.The North American Versa debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January of the same year. The hatchback model was introduced first, with the sedan arriving later at the end of the year, both as 2007 models. A 1.6-liter sedan replaced the 1.8-liter sedan in Canada for the 2009 model year, that year in the United States the 1.6 sedan was added to the lineup along the 1.8 sedan.\nThe Versa is powered by a 1.8 L I4 MR series engine producing 122 hp (91 kW) and 127 ft\u00b7lbf (170 N\u00b7m). Three transmissions are offered: a four-speed automatic, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a six-speed manual. Two trim levels include the S and SL\u2014the SL offering air conditioning, power accessories and ABS, all of which are options on the S. The Versa SL also has features/options not available on the S such as cruise control (available on some S models), alloy wheels, optional CVT (the four-speed automatic is only available for the Versa S but CVT is available on some S models), optional Bluetooth connectivity for electronic devices, and a sport package which adds a power moonroof, rear spoiler, and underside aero kit.\nIntroduced for the 2009 model year in sedan form only, is the Versa 1.6-liter which uses the HR16DE inline-four gasoline engine, rated at 107 hp (80 kW) and 111 lb\u22c5ft (150 N\u22c5m) of torque. The base transmission is a five-speed manual; a four-speed automatic is optional.\nThe Versa 1.6 features black trim (instead of body-colored) for the exterior mirror housings, license plate trim, and front grille; 14-inch steel wheels; black interior; four radio speakers with pre-wiring for a radio\u2014but no radio itself. Safety features include six airbags, active front head restraints, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and keyless entry are offered as part of a value package. Anti-lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist are optional ($250) on top of the value package.\nWhen it was introduced in fall 2008, the Versa's base price of US$9,990 made it the least expensive new car available in the United States, but a price cut to the Hyundai Accent usurped that distinction by $20. The Versa 1.6's $12,498 Canadian base price also undercut its competitors at launch.\n2010 models featured a redesigned grille and a new design for the 1.8S model's wheel covers. In North America, the sedan was replaced by its second generation starting the 2012 model year (hence, 2011 being its last). The fate of the hatchback was however extended for one more year, 2012 being its last. Production of both for that market stopped in mid-2011.\nThe Tiida sedan was discontinued in Mexico. It was since been replaced by the new Versa in October 2019.\n\nSouth AmericaOn 11 January 2008, Chrysler LLC and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Chrysler with a new car based on Nissan Versa sedan for limited distribution in South America in 2009.\n\n\n=== Electric prototype ===\n\nThe EV-11 prototype electric car was based on Tiida and used an 80 kW (107 hp) and 280 N\u22c5m (207 lb\u22c5ft) electric motor, 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack rated 160 km (99 mi) distance, navigation system, EV remote control and monitoring.\n\nThe prototype vehicle was unveiled in Nissan's Yokohama headquarters on 8 February 2009. Production version was set to begin sale in US and Japan in 2010.\n\n\n== Second generation (C12; 2011) ==\n\nThe second generation, C12 series of the Nissan Tiida was unveiled in April 2011 at the Shanghai Auto Show. Sales in China commenced in June 2011. It is available only as a five-door hatchback, and is notably not sold in Japan. The C11 Tiida sedan was instead replaced by the Nissan Latio (N17) and Nissan Sylphy (B17). The C12 Tiida is in fact heavily related to the Sylphy B17\u2014both base their construction on the Nissan V platform and share substantial mechanicals. The Thai manufactured versions even share the Sylphy B17's interior; the original Chinese and Taiwanese models feature a distinctive design. Powertrains also remain common between C12 and B17 models.\nInstead of being sized and marketed as both a subcompact or a compact car depending on the country, the new, noticeably larger Tiida will be marketed as a C-segment worldwide as the March/Micra and Latio will take the place of the B-segment markets.It is available with the 188 hp turbocharged 1.6-litre petrol engine, with gasoline direct injection paired with a continuously variable transmission. Other engines will be announced closer to the release date.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nAsiaIn Thailand, the Tiida hatchback is called the Nissan Pulsar, which went on sale by February 2013. The Tiida hatchback comes with MRA8DE, which it shares with the Nissan Sylphy. In Taiwan, the Tiida hatchback is known as the Big Tiida in advertisement due to the size upgrade and went on sale in January 2013.\n\nAustraliaIn Australia, the Tiida name was dropped in favour of a return to using Nissan Pulsar, which was a very popular nameplate up to 2005.The SSS high performance version with a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine arrived in late 2013. It was aimed at the \"warm\" hatch market which is a category placed between standard and hot hatches. It featured a 140 kilowatt turbocharged MR16DDT engine found in the Nissan Pulsar ST-S variant. It is also found in the Nissan Juke ST-S and TI-S. The engine was connected to either a close ratio 6 speed manual gearbox or Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) automatic.

The facelift was a budget update to keep the appearance of the C12 Tiida in Taiwan in line with the C13 Tiida in other markets. The facelift replaces the front and rear light units with redesigned set up and light strips, front and rear bumpers, and the front grille. The new front grille features the updated Nissan V motion styling and the rear bumper was designed to mimic those on the C13 Tiida.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Third generation (C13; 2015) ==\n\nSince March 2015, the Nissan Pulsar (C13), as sold in most of Europe, is sold in Russia and China under the Tiida nameplate.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nissan Tiida at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Yokohama (Japanese: \u6a2a\u6d5c, pronounced [jokohama] (listen)) is the second-largest city in Japan by population, and the most populous municipality of Japan. It is the capital city of Kanagawa Prefecture. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kant\u014d region of the main island of Honshu. It is a major commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area.\nYokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nYokohama (\u6a2a\u6d5c) literally means \"horizontal beach\". The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the \u014coka River and the Nakamura River had been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a \"horizontal beach\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening of the Treaty Port (1859\u20131868) ===\nYokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners. A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853\u201354, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.It was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the bustling town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the T\u014dkaid\u014d for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.Yokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English speaking residents as The Bluff.\nKannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, inside the barrier), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound.  Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.\nTo protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city. Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan's first English language newspaper, the Japan Herald published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream and beer to be produced in Japan.  Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863 and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866 and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly \u2013 attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji and Taisho Periods (1868\u20131923) ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan's first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan's first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel Around the World in Eighty Days, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.\nIn 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city's first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal-burning plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889. By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.\nThe early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Great Kanto earthquake and the Second World War (1923\u20131945) ===\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923 by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170. Fuelled by rumours of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum. Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake. Martial law was in place until November 19. Rubble from the quake was used to reclaim land for parks, the most famous being the Yamashita Park on the waterfront which opened in 1930.\n\nYokohama was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by U.S. air raids during World War II. An estimated seven or eight thousand people were killed in a single morning on May 29, 1945 in what is now known as the Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the city and in just one hour and nine minutes reduced 42% of it to rubble.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II growth ===\nDuring the American occupation, Yokohama was a major transshipment base for American supplies and personnel, especially during the Korean War. After the occupation, most local U.S. naval activity moved from Yokohama to an American base in nearby Yokosuka.\nThe city was designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956.The city's tram and trolleybus system was abolished in 1972, the same year as the opening of the first line of Yokohama Municipal Subway.\nConstruction of Minato Mirai 21 (\"Port Future 21\"), a major urban development project on reclaimed land, started in 1983.  Minato Mirai 21 hosted the Yokohama Exotic Showcase in 1989, which saw the first public operation of maglev trains in Japan and the opening of Cosmo Clock 21, then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. The 860m-long Yokohama Bay Bridge opened in the same year.\nIn 1993, Minato Mirai saw the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup final was held in June at the International Stadium Yokohama.\nIn 2009, the city marked the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration.  An early part in the commemoration project incorporated the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) which was held in Yokohama in May 2008.\nIn November 2010, Yokohama hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nThese municipalities surround Yokohama.\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nKawasaki\nYokosuka\nZushi\nKamakura\nFujisawa\nYamatoTokyo\n\nMachida\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nYokohama features a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) with hot and humid summers and chilly winters. Weatherwise, Yokohama has a pattern of rain, clouds and sun, although in winter, it is surprisingly sunny, more so than Southern Spain.

        "wiki": "The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007. It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBetween 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.\n\nThe GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or R35 for short (where CBA stands for the emissions standard prefix), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.\nThe GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla, originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.\n\n\n=== Concepts ===\n\nNissan showed two GT-R concept cars at motor shows before it unveiled the production model: one at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001, to preview a 21st-century GT-R; and a redesigned one, dubbed GT-R Proto, at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show. Officials said the production GT-R would be 80 to 90% based on the second concept.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Production model ===\nThe production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as the 2009 model year, with a lap time of 7:38 minutes at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife beating the all time sports classic Porsche 911 Turbo as Nissan stated before launching the car. The GT-R launched in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine. The cars are built at their Tochigi plant on a shared production line.\n\n\n==== Design ====\n\nNissan chief creative officer, Shir\u014d Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series. Nakamura stated: \"The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car; it had to really reflect Japanese culture.\"\nNissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline.Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.\n\n\n===== Nissan PM platform =====\nAs of 2014 the GT-R was the only model built on Nissan's Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture introduced on the 2001 (V35) Skyline. It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs similar to those used in race car construction. Alcoa aluminium is used for the hood, trunk lid and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminium front shock towers and inner door structures. Outer body panels are stamped using multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front crossmember/radiator support.\n\n\n===== Exterior =====\nNissan developed a 6-stage paint process with double clear coat and chip-resistant paint for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.\n\n\n===== Optional features =====\nThe Premium trim for the GT-R has a body-coloured rear spoiler whereas the Black Edition has a dry carbon-fibre rear spoiler. Both the Premium and Black Edition models are fitted with (LED) headlights, automatic on/off headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights and brake lights, dual heated body-colour power wing mirrors, power folding wing mirrors, flush-mounted aluminium door handles, four 5-inch exhaust outlets with polished tips and UV-reducing solar glass.\n\n\n==== Specifications ====\n\nThe Nissan GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT V6 engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) DOHC V6 with plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima (IHI) turbochargers provide forced induction. Models manufactured between 2007 and 2009 are rated at a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 358 kW (487 PS; 480 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 583 N\u22c5m (430 lb\u22c5ft) at 3,200\u20135,200 rpm. The engine also meets California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. The standard GT-R and the NISMO GT-R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.27.A curb weight of 1,724 kg (3,800 lb) with side curtain airbags is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminium used for the hood, trunk, and doors. A rear mounted six-speed BorgWarner designed dual clutch semi-automatic transmission built by Aichi Machine Industry shifting gears in just 0.2 seconds is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system to provide power to all four wheels, along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC-R) to aid in stability. Three shift modes can also be selected for various conditions. The Nissan GT-R features four-wheel 15\" floating disc Brembo brakes with monoblock calipers (six-piston on the front; four-piston on the rear).\n\n\n==== 2011 facelift ====\n\nThe revised GT-R features an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 406 kW (552 PS; 544 hp) and 612 N\u22c5m (451 lb\u22c5ft) of torque from 3,200 to 6,000 rpm. Changes also include a new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality.

On Mardenborough's fastest lap which took 1:17.47 minutes, the car averaged 122 km/h and reached a top speed of 211 km/h.\nThe GT-R/C is fitted with four robots that operate the steering, transmission, brakes and throttle. Six computers mounted in the rear of the car update the controls at up to 100 times a second.\nThe unmodified DualShock 4 connects to a micro-computer that interprets the joystick and button signals and transmits them to the cars's onboard systems. The wireless operation has a primary control range of one kilometer.\nTo help Mardenborough judge the vehicle's speed through the corners, a Racelogic VBOX Motorsport sensor was installed to relay speed data to a LCD display in the helicopter cockpit.\nThe GT-R/C is also fitted with two independent safety systems operating on different radio frequencies in order to allow two additional operators to apply full ABS braking and cut the engine in the event of the main operator losing control of the vehicle.\nIn 2018, the Nissan GT-R/C will be used in a tour of primary and secondary schools in the UK to promote future careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects.\n\n\n== Performance ==\n\nNissan states the GT-R can attain a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph) and Motor Trend recorded a top speed of 313.8 km/h (195.0 mph). In tests the original production model was shown to be capable of achieving 0-97 km/h (60 mph) times as low as 3.2 seconds using \"launch control\". Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term \"launch control\", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle dynamic control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4,500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that \"we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'\". The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.The updated GT-R now has a launch mode called \"R-Mode Start\". Pushing the three buttons up, includes the Transmission, Suspension and VDC the car gets to \"R-Mode Start\". The system allows a maximum of 4 consecutive hard launches before locking itself out, after which it can be unlocked by driving normally for 2.4 km (1.5 mi). The increased engine output of later models combined with the \"R-Mode Start\" has lowered the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) time to 3.2 seconds. Motor Trend achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.6 seconds at 190 km/h (120 mph) using a US-spec 2009 model year GT-R. Autocar achieved a 0-160 km/h (100 mph) time of 8.5 seconds.The 2017 model year GT-R can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in the same time of 2.7 seconds and achieve a 400 m (1\u20444 mi) time of 10.7 seconds at 204 km/h (127 mph). In 2017, the German car magazine Auto Bild tested the top speed of the 2017 model year GT-R and reached a top speed of 328 km/h (204 mph).\n\n\n=== Independent lap times ===\nTesting by Drivers Republic of a GT-R and 911 GT2 in stock form resulted in times of 7:56 minutes for the GT-R and 7:49 minutes for the GT2 respectively in partially damp conditions. While the tester had no doubt that the GT2 could achieve the factory time of 7:32 minutes, he couldn't imagine the customer GT-R going faster than 7:41 minutes in spite of the 7:29 minutes of factory claim.The German magazine sport auto achieved a time of 7:50 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a car supplied to them by Nissan during an initial short test in 2007 in partially damp condition. In 2009, in a full \"super test\" sport auto achieved a time of 7:38 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma, identical to a later \"super test\" Corvette ZR1 time. In a first test with the facelifted GT-R model, sport auto recorded a lap time of 7:34 minutes on the N\u00fcrburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma.The sport auto magazine tested the 2007 model year GT-R on the Hockenheimring circuit and recorded a lap time of 1:10.7 minutes during the \"supertest\".\n\n\n=== Nissan's N\u00fcrburgring lap times ===\nIn 2009 Nissan claimed a lap time of 7:26.7 minutes with a 2009 model year GT-R on the base model's Dunlop tires having previously set a time of 7:29 minutes on standard Japanese market tires. Porsche has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. Porsche claimed to have conducted a test of a factory stock, European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54 minutes), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissan's. Nissan disputed the former and implied the latter claim in October 2008.In September 2010, Nissan's sets a N\u00fcrburgring lap time using the 2011 model year GT-R with a new design. Driven by GT-R's development driver Toshio Suzuki. and the car set a lap time of 7:24.22 minutes.\nAccording to Nissan, the GT-R improved its N\u00fcrburgring lap time in October 2012 to 7:19.1 minutes by due to the 2014 model year improvements. This made it the 9th fastest ever production car around the N\u00fcrburgring at the time. Nissan claimed that it lost half a second in traffic, making a potential lap time of 7:18.6 minutes possible.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\nN\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife\nIn February 2013, Nissan opened the new NISMO headquarters in Yokohama. Nissan's CEO Carlos Ghosn planned to introduce the GT-R NISMO within a year as the leading NISMO brand and attempt a production vehicle lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. On May 18 development began, with Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Noboru Kaneko leading the joint NISMO and Dunlop Tyres effort to set the production vehicle lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring.\nOn June 26, the team started testing with standard GT-R's at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway. On July 16, the team visited the N\u00fcrburgring and collected data to aid development, and the team build the GT-R NISMO and its aerodynamic development was finalized after testing it at the Sendai Raceway on July 24.\nOn September 2, the team returned to the N\u00fcrburgring with three GT-R NISMO cars and four drivers with two laps for each driver. drivers included Infiniti Red Bull Racing third driver S\u00e9bastien Buemi, NISMO global brand ambassador and racer Michael Krumm, German touring car driver Armin Hahne, and a Japanese driver, Tetsuya Tanaka. team stopped all the tests of GT-R NISMO and on September 30, the team was aiming for a lap under 7:10 minutes, Armin Hahne and Tetsuya Tanaka didn't get close to the target record but S\u00e9bastien Buemi did a lap time of 7:12 minutes on his first lap, on his second lap he stopped to take some fuel out to reduce the weight. On the way to do a lap time under 7:10 minutes the car ran out of fuel. Michael Krumm did his first lap time of 7:10 minutes.\nAt 4:48 p.m just twelve minutes before the Nordschleife was scheduled to close, and five minutes before the rain, Michael Krumm did his second lap time of 7:08.679 minutes and achieved a peak speed of 310 km/h (193 mph) on the Dottinger Hohe uphill climb, Nissan claimed it was the fastest road-legal volume production vehicle, and it was 11 seconds slower than the production vehicle lap record holder limited production Porsche 918 Spyder Weissach Package's lap time of 6:57 minutes set earlier that month, making it the second fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track.\nAfter setting the lap time, the NISMO team invited the Car and Driver journalist Tony Quiroga to attempt the fastest lap time with a passenger at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. Michael Krumm drove the GT-R NISMO with the journalist and set a lap record for fastest production vehicle with a passenger around the track with a lap time of 7:19.46 minutes with a peak speed of 303 km/h (188 mph) on the Dottinger Hohe uphill climb.\nGoodwood Hill Climb\nIn June 2014, the Nissan GT-R NISMO was revealed at the Goodwood Festival. The car ran on the Goodwood Hill climb, driven by Jann Mardenborough, set a time of 49.27 seconds, making it the fastest road-legal production vehicle up the hill.\nN\u00fcrburgring GP 5.15 km CourseOn August 13, 2014, German car magazine Sport Auto tested the 2015 model year GT-R NISMO at the [\u00f1Nurburgring GP 5.15 km circuit, driven by Christian Gebhardt, set a new road-legal production vehicle lap record around the track with a 2:13.80 minutes of lap time.\nWillow SpringsOn September, 2014, Motor Trend conducted a test using the 2015 model year Nissan GT-R NISMO at Willow Springs - Street of Willow circuit.

On December 9, 2019 Nissan again broke the own record of the fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track using a 2020 model year Nissan GT-R NISMO, driven by Tsugio Matsuda, set a lap time of 59.361 seconds.\nINTA CircuitIn 2018, Nissan conducted a test on the INTA Circuit in Spain, driven by Marc Gen\u00e9 with a 2017 model year GT-R NISMO, GT-R Track Edition and a GT-R Premium. The GT-R NISMO set a new road-legal production vehicle lap record around track with a lap time of 1:05.83 minutes. The GT-R Track Edition lapped in 1:06.39 minutes and took the second place, GT-R Premium lapped in 1:06.93 minutes and took the third place of the road-legal production vehicle lap records around track.\n\n\n== Motorsport ==\nThe Nissan GT-R had various motorsport success in motor racing, drag racing, time attack, hill climbing, drifting, etc. In motor racing the GT-R won the championships and had incredible success in Super GT Series, RAC Tourist Trophy, FIA GT1 World Championship, Pirelli World Challenge, Intercontinental GT Challenge, 24 hours of N\u00fcrburgring, Bathurst 12 Hour, 24 hours of Spa, Blancpain Endurance Series and Super Taikyu Series.\n\n\n=== Super GT ===\n\nNISMO, the motorsport arm of Nissan, entered the Nissan GT-R in the Super GT race series in the GT500 class for the 2008 season, replacing the 350Z.The 2008 GT500 version of the car has a completely different drivetrain compared to the production car. The race car is upgraded to a VK45DE 4.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 instead of the twin-turbocharged VR38DETT V6 engine. It uses a 6 speed sequential manual gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race car.\n\nA prototype was spotted testing around the Suzuka Circuit as well as Fuji Speedway in Japan. The car went on to win the opening race of the 2008 Super GT season at Suzuka scoring a one-two finish for Nissan. In race two, the GT-Rs repeated their 1\u20132 result. It won the drivers' championship in the 2008 season through the Xanavi NISMO GT-R driven by Satoshi Motoyama and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer, although they only came third in the teams' championship. It also won 7 out of 9 races by 4 different teams using GT-Rs.The GT500 version scored 4 victories in the 2009 Japanese SUPER GT Series GT 500 class.\nIn 2010, the VK45DE 4.5-litre engine was replaced by a newly developed 3.4-litre engine (VRH34A).In 2011 and 2012, Team Mola GT-R with drivers Ronnie Quintarelli and Masataka Yanagida got back to back championships in both teams' and drivers' classifications in the Super GT500 class.In 2014, the Super GT regulations were aligned with those of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, and so the V8 engine was replaced with a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder turbocharged engine.\n\n\n=== FIA GT/GT1 World Championship ===\n\nOn February 27, 2009, NISMO announced a partnership with British racing team Gigawave Motorsports to enter a GT-R in four races in the 2009 FIA GT Championship season. The entry did not compete for championship points, but was used by NISMO to refine the performance of the GT-R for future customer teams to use the car in the planned FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010. NISMO driver Michael Krumm and Gigawave driver Darren Turner would co-drive the GT1 GT-R.The Sumo Power GT-R won the 2010 RAC Tourist Trophy at Silverstone Circuit as part of the FIA GT1 World Championship on May 2, 2010.\nThe 2011 season saw Swiss Racing Team switch to Lamborghini which left Sumo Power running four GT-Rs, two under the Sumo Power GT name and two under JR Motorsports.\nJR Motorsports with the drivers Michael Krumm and Lucas Luhr won the Drivers Championship for the 2011 season, gaining 3 wins and 1 pole position in 10 races.

Later in 2008 a GT-R won the Competition Modern class in the Targa West before returning to Targa Tasmania in 2009 to take the outright win in the Modern class. In 2009 Nissan's GT-R won the One Lap of America competition. In 2010 the GT-R finished 2nd over all in the One Lap of America competition.\nDuring the 2010 SCCA World Challenge season, a pair of GT class GT-Rs were campaigned by Brass Monkey Racing and driven by Steve Ott and Tony Rivera.On June 4, 2010, NISMO announced a Club Track Edition GT-R available via its Nissan supported Omori aftermarket factory. This domestic market trim is a non-street legal, race-ready variant equipped with a 6-point roll cage and upgraded with NISMO race package developed through its Tokachi endurance racer program.\n\nOn June 25 and 26, 2011, the No. 71 Schulze Motorsport Nissan GT-R took part in the 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring 2011 driven by Michael Schulze, Tobias Schulze, Kazunori Yamauchi and Yasuyoshi Yamamoto. The car finished the race in 36th place overall, achieving a victory in the SP 8T class after overcoming several technical problems. It was the first time a Nissan GT-R took part in the 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring. In the following year, Nissan participated the SP8T class with 2 Club Track Edition GT-Rs as works team, which driven by Team Nissan and Team GT Academy, both cars completed the race in 99th and 30th in overall respectively \u2013 through they are the only entries in SP-8T class that year.\n\n\n== Aftermarket tuning ==\n\n\n=== Tuning ===\nDespite early concerns about the difficulty of modifying the Nissan GT-R, many aftermarket tuning parts have become available. The previously reported \"untuneable\" ECU has since been hacked by several tuning houses.\nCOBB Tuning was the first company to access the GT-R's encrypted ECU. With their AccessPORT anyone can reprogram both the engine and transmission control units with off the shelf or custom maps. Mine's also has limited control of the ECU, and others (MCR, HKS, and Top Secret) have bypassed the unit. They have been seen testing modified GT-Rs with the former two having conducted tests at the Tsukuba Circuit.Ecutek tuning on the other hand was the first company to manipulate and change shift points on the GT-R in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap-around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5.\nOn January 16, 2013, Ecutek also became the first company to construct and offer Flex Fuel hardware and software capability for all Nissan GT-Rs. This fuel kit requires the Ecutek specific TCM. The kit provides changes in the cold start cranking compensation, changes to the maximum target boost, changes in the ignition timing, changes to target airflow, changes in cam timing, and changes in the fuel economy gauge reading all based solely on ethanol content in the gas tank.Japan based tuner Mine's has created the VR38DETT super response engine which uses lightened engine internals like titanium rods, lightened pistons and many other components that allow the engine to rev more quickly, it makes 588 kW; 789 hp; 800 PS.AMS Performance, Alpha Logic Performance and Extreme Turbo Systems all build drag cars and aftermarket tuner parts for the Nissan GT-R.\nIn a review by Motor Trend editor Scott Kanemura, it was revealed that the GPS system fitted to the GT-R would remove the 180 km/h (112 mph) speed limiter when the car arrives at a race track, but only on tracks approved by Nissan. Aftermarket ECUs have been developed to bypass the speed limiter, in addition to stand-alone speed-limiter defeaters. The GPS check will not be implemented in American models.In August 2008, Nissan's official motorsport and tuning arm NISMO announced the \"Club Sport\" tuning package for the GT-R . The package, which is also fitted to the SpecV, includes Bilstein Damptronic compatible dampers, 20\" forged aluminum wheels from RAYS Engineering, Bridgestone run-flat tires, Recaro carbon fiber-shelled bucket seats, a titanium exhaust, and a revised rear diffuser with an added cooling duct. The package is supported by a warranty and saves over 20 kg (44 lb).\n\n\n=== Drag Racing ===\nAMS Performance, based in West Chicago Illinois, has set record power levels and performance numbers for the GT-R. Their Alpha Omega GT-R as well as the first GT-R to reach the 9's, 8's, and 7's. In June 2013, OMEGA broke into the 7s when it ran a 7.98 at 299.56 km/h (186.14 mph). During the evening of the 7 second pass Omega broke a couple of other records. Omega bested its previous 97\u2013209 km/h (60\u2013130 mph) time with 2.67 seconds. Omega also broke the 161\u2013241 km/h (100\u2013150 mph) record which was previously held by an Underground Racing TT Gallardo (2.58 seconds) with 2.45 seconds. But in June 2015, the Alpha Omega GT-R get generating over 2050 whp and boasts 0\u201360 mph time of 1.49 seconds. Omega set multiple world records at the WannaGoFast 1/2 Mile Shootout at Built Field Airport in Monee, Illinois which included: 361.8 km/h (224.91 mph) in a standing 1/2 mile; 97\u2013209 km/h (60\u2013130 mph) time in 2.28 seconds; 0\u2013161 km/h (0\u2013100 mph) in 2.78 seconds; 0\u2013300 km/h (0\u2013186 mph) in 7.07 seconds; 0\u2013322 km/h (0\u2013200 mph) in 10.49 seconds. the Alpha Omega GT-R did its best of quarter-mile time in 7.49 seconds at 310 km/h (193 mph). making it the quickest and fastest GT-R and road-legal vehicle in the world. and the car won the King Of The Streets competition two times in the row. The AMS Performance Alpha Omega package functions more as a shop/research and development vehicle which is the reason why it is not available to the general public. However, anybody can purchase the Alpha 6, Alpha 9, Alpha 10, Alpha 12, Alpha 14, Alpha 16 and Alpha X packages; each respectively with approximately 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1,400, 1,600, 2,200 wheel horsepower when installed and tuned.In 2017 AMS Performance build a GT-R calls Alpha-G GT-R and the car will be the first Nissan GT-R to do a quarter mile in 6 seconds. Car ran it from 6.937 seconds driven by Gidi Chamdi with a trap speed of 315.36 km/h (196 mph) and held the fastest AWD record. But Later ETS (Extreme Turbo Systems) GT-R broke the record with a 6.88 seconds of quarter mile pass at 358.80 km/h (223 mph). And it became as the world's fastest car at a standing half mile with trap speed of 410.29 km/h (255 mph).In December 2018, the Alpha Logic Performance from Dubai set the quarter-mile record for fastest GT-R and fastest AWD using their \"Panda\" GT-R in 6.582 seconds at 373.82 km/h (232.28 mph).But in 2019 Import vs Domestic finals the 3500 whp and 100 PSI of boost ETS-G GT-R broke the quickest and fastest GT-R, AWD and  Stock Unibody world record. Car ran the 1/4 mile in 6.56 seconds and a trap speed of 362.02 km/h (225 mph). And won the competition by beating the Alpha Queen GT-R which is ran a 6.87 second quarter mile.\n\nAt the Dragtimes Competition, Russia, the AMS Alpha 12 GT-R broke the fastest road-legal standing 1 mile record driven by Jury with a trap speed of 382 km/h (237 mph) but later the record broken by a 2500 whp Ford GT. Later in the same competition, Switzer Goliath GT-R broke the quickest road-legal standing 1 mile record in 22.602 seconds with a trap speed of 402 km/h (250 mph).\n\n\n=== Time Attack ===\nModified Nissan GT-Rs have competed in time attack challenges, specially for WTAC (World Time Attack Challenge). Time attack GT-Rs have been fielded by HKS, Precision Automotive Racing and LYFE.\nIn 2015, the HKS GT-R became as the fastest time attack GT-R, it has the same VR38DETT engine generating over 1200 whp. It became the fastest vehicle at Fontana, California, Fuji Speedway (with a peak speed of over 322 km/h (200 mph) and in Sydney Motorsport Park. the car compete at the 2015 WTAC and won the GT-R R35 class with a fastest lap record of 1:30.838 minutes. But in 2017, LYFE's 1136 whp GT-R broke all HKS's records and won the title as fastest time attack GT-R at the WTAC.In 2017 WTAC, Precision Automotive Racing's GT-R, driven by Aaron McGranahan, set a peak speed of 269 km/h (167 mph) and won the Flying 500 class title.\n\n\n=== Hill Climb ===\nThe Nissan GT-R has competed in both stock and modified forms in many hill climbing competitions, such as the Jaguar Simola Hill Climb in South Africa.\nAt the 2019 Jaguar Simola Hill Climb, the Nissan GT-R was named the most successful supercar. In the final Top 10 Shootout event, Kyle Mitchell won the event, setting a time of 40.862 seconds and becoming the fastest road-legal vehicle.\n\n\n=== Drifting ===\nIn February 2016, using a modified GT-R NISMO, Masato Kawabata set a new world record for the fastest 30-degree drift at approximately 304 km/h at the Fujairah International Airport.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Nissan GT-R played a main role in Fast & Furious 6. The car in the widely successful movie has modified bumpers, new vented hood, modified fenders, side sills, carbon doors, carbon roof, and carbon spoilers.\nOn the August 13, 2014, Mike Newman broke the record for the 'fastest speed for a car driven blindfolded' in a Nissan GT-R modified by Litchfield Motors (UK).\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\n\n== Sales ==\nFrom 2007 to 2017 Nissan produced over 37,315 GT-R units and sold for different markets. This makes it the most sold Nissan sports car and one of the highest sales for any production sports car. These are the sales figures for July, 2020.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Statistics by US model year ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Nissan GT-R has appeared in numerous video games, including the Initial D Arcade Stage, Initial D, Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, Sega GT, Assetto Corsa, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, Need for Speed, Midnight Club,Wangan Midnight, Asphalt and Forza Horizon.\nThe GT-R also appeared in The Fast And The Furious movie franchise as Paul Walker's Brian O' Conner's vehicle.

Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nThe area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.\nMinato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at \u014csanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMajor attractions in the area include:\n\nYokohama Landmark Tower - the second-tallest building and fourth-tallest structure in Japan, with sweeping views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji\nCosmo World amusement park \u2014 includes the 100-metre (328 ft) tall Cosmo Clock 21, formerly the world's tallest Ferris wheel\nKishamichi Promenade - a pedestrian walkway that follows the original harbor railroad tracks, linking Sakuragich\u014d Station with Yokohama World Porters and the Cosmo Clock, and offering expansive views of the Minato Mirai skyline\nMinato Mirai Hall - concert hall home to the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra\nPacifico Yokohama\nNippon Maru - a four masted sailing ship, permanently docked on the harbor at Minato Mirai as a museum\nYokohama Museum of Art\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nQueen's Square Yokohama (Official website)\n\n\n== Major hotels ==\nMajor hotels in the area with over 300 guestrooms include:\n\nYokohama Bay Grand InterContinental Hotel\nPan Pacific Yokohama Bay Hotel Tokyu\nYokohama Royal Park Hotel\nYokohama Sakuragicho Washington Hotel\nYokohama Bay Sheraton Hotel and towers\n\n\n== Railway stations ==\nMinatomirai Station\nSakuragich\u014d Station\nShin-Takashima Station\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

        "wiki": "The Taste of Tea (\u8336\u306e\u5473, Cha no Aji) is the third film by Japanese writer and director Katsuhito Ishii. The film has been referred to as a \"surreal\" version of Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander (1982). It was a selection of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film is concerned with the lives of the Haruno family, who live in rural Tochigi Prefecture, the countryside north of Tokyo. Nobuo is a hypnotherapist. He teaches his son, Hajime, Go. Hajime becomes an excellent Go player, but he has a rough time with girls and puberty. Yoshiko refuses to be an average housewife and works on animated film projects at home. She uses assistance from grandfather Akira, an eccentric old man who is a former animator and occasional model. \nEight-year-old Sachiko periodically sees a silent, giant-size double of herself which mimics or benignly watches her. She contemplates ways to rid herself of it. Uncle Ayano is a sound engineer and record producer who comes to stay for a visit. He engages in inward reflection, seeks closure regarding an old relationship, and recounts a childhood experience \u2014 a tale that influences Sachiko and ties into later events.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTomokazu Miura - Nobuo Haruno - father\nSatomi Tezuka - Yoshiko Haruno - mother\nMaya Banno - Sachiko Haruno - daughter\nTakahiro Sato - Hajime Haruno - son\nTadanobu Asano - Ayano Haruno - uncle\nTatsuya Gashuin - Akira Todoroki - grandpa\nTomoko Nakajima - Akira Terako\nIkki Todoroki - Himself\nAnna Tsuchiya - Aoi Suzuishi\nKenichi Matsuyama - Matsuken/The man in the red shirt\nHideaki Anno - Kasugabe\nRinko Kikuchi - Yuriko Kikuchi\nRyo Kase - Rokutaro Hamadayama\nKenji Mizuhashi - Maki Hoshino\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Taste of Tea has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 77/100 weighted average on Metacritic. It was also one of Ed Park's choices in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAudience Award - 2004, Entrevues Film Festival\nGrand Prix - 2004, Entrevues Film Festival\nBest Feature Film - 2004, Hawaii International Film Festival\nBest New Actress (Anna Tsuchiya) - 2004, Hochi Film Awards\nOrient Express Award - 2004, Festival de Cine de Sitges (Special Mention)\nAudience Award - 2005, Dejima Japanese Film Festival\nBest Asian Film - 2005, Fant-Asia Film Festival\nFantasia Ground-Breaker Award - 2005, Fant-Asia Film Festival (3rd Place)\nAudience Award - 2005, New York Asian Film Festival\nBest New Actress (Anna Tsuchiya) - 2005 Kinema Junpo Awards\nNew Talent Award (Anna Tsuchiya) - 2005, Mainichi Film Award\nFestival Prize - 2005, Yokohama Film Festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\u8336\u306e\u5473 (in Japanese).

        "wiki": "Minato Mirai 21 (\u307f\u306a\u3068\u307f\u3089\u304421, Minato Mirai Nij\u016bichi), often known as simply Minato Mirai and abbreviated as MM, is the central business district of Yokohama, Japan. Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama's traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.\nToday, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous caf\u00e9s and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMinato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama's six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central 'core' of Yokohama. The name \"Minato Mirai 21\",  was selected by a public opinion poll, and means \"Port of the Future [in] the 21[st century]\".\nThe area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan's third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nThe area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.\nMinato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at \u014csanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nMajor attractions in the area include:\n\nYokohama Landmark Tower - the second-tallest building and fourth-tallest structure in Japan, with sweeping views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji\nCosmo World amusement park \u2014 includes the 100-metre (328 ft) tall Cosmo Clock 21, formerly the world's tallest Ferris wheel\nKishamichi Promenade - a pedestrian walkway that follows the original harbor railroad tracks, linking Sakuragich\u014d Station with Yokohama World Porters and the Cosmo Clock, and offering expansive views of the Minato Mirai skyline\nMinato Mirai Hall - concert hall home to the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra\nPacifico Yokohama\nNippon Maru - a four masted sailing ship, permanently docked on the harbor at Minato Mirai as a museum\nYokohama Museum of Art\nYokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nQueen's Square Yokohama (Official website)\n\n\n== Major hotels ==\nMajor hotels in the area with over 300 guestrooms include:\n\nYokohama Bay Grand InterContinental Hotel\nPan Pacific Yokohama Bay Hotel Tokyu\nYokohama Royal Park Hotel\nYokohama Sakuragicho Washington Hotel\nYokohama Bay Sheraton Hotel and towers\n\n\n== Railway stations ==\nMinatomirai Station\nSakuragich\u014d Station\nShin-Takashima Station\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

Band\u014d is the old name for what is now the Kant\u014d region, used in this case because the temples are all in the Prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama, Tokyo, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Chiba. As is the case with all such circuits, each location has a rank, and pilgrims believe that visiting them all in order is an act of great religious merit.Started by Minamoto no Yoritomo and his son Sanetomo, the Band\u014d Sanj\u016bsankasho is just one of 70 different Kannon pilgrimage circuits existing in Japan, each including 33 temples because the Goddess is believed to have 33 different manifestations. Sugimoto-dera in Kamakura is number one, Zushi's Gandenji's is number two, An'y\u014d-in in Kamakura is the number three, the famous Hasedera in Hase number four, and so on. From its beginning at Sugimotodera to its end in Chiba's Nagodera, the circuit is over 1300 km long. Even though women were allowed to pray at individual temples, the circuit was originally reserved to male pilgrims. Now however most of the pilgrims are women. Pilgrims leave behind a slip of paper  or a sticker as a proof of their visit, and many of these can be seen plastered on temple walls and pillars.\n\n\n== The 33 temples of the Band\u014d Sanj\u016bsankasho circuit ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapan 100 Kannon, pilgrimage composed of the Saigoku, Band\u014d and Chichibu pilgrimages.\nSaigoku 33 Kannon, pilgrimage in the Kansai region.\nChichibu 34 Kannon, pilgrimage in Saitama Prefecture.\nShikoku Pilgrimage, 88 Temple pilgrimage in the Shikoku island.\nCh\u016bgoku 33 Kannon, pilgrimage in the Ch\u016bgoku region.\nKannon\nBuddhism in Japan\nTourism in Japan\nFor an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDonald Richie.

          "This temple complex provides a scenic walk and breathtaking views of the sea. Like any other shrine/temple visit, be prepared for a lot of walking up stairs but it is well worth it. It is also large enough that you can take your time and take breaks as needed. It is located in",

          "We had a very enjoyable time exploring this beautiful and interesting temple. There is a little cave at a corner of the ground which I loved, and the view from the top of the temple was very nice. If you only have time for one temple, visit Hase-dera!",

          "All of the interesting attractions of Kamakura can be easily visited in a day trip from Tokyo. The Hase-dera is the most important of all of them. It is set in a beautiful garden with some running brooks. Should visit",
          "Hasedera is huge, and one can spend a considerable amount of time here (compared to Kotoku-in). I particularly enjoyed their garden and ponds, as well as the observatory deck. There were stairs further up from the observation deck (it seems to go a long way), but due to my mom",

          "Gardens and Temple buildings were special. Lots to see- wonderful statues, distinctive plants. Kamakura has lots of temples and this is a top 3. If you have a day on a cruise ship, you can do 3-4 temples in Kamakura taking subway and train. Recommend some taxis once you get",
          "I went on a busy Sunday, but there did seem to a focus on collecting money. Gate charges are not expensive and I suppose upkeep can cost a lot as there are so many buildings, paths, gardens, shrines, and statues. The views are impressive out to sea, there is food available, and",

          "The temple can be found in Kamakura which is about 1.5 hours away from Tokyo. It is walking distance from Kamakura station. It sits half way up Mt Kamukura. It has a viewing deck overlooking Kamakura Beach. The gardens are beautiful. There is a small bamboo garden which is",
          "I was not planned to enter this temple as I am looking to another big Buddha (Daibutsu) which nearby this area. Ticket at Yen 300 (adult). It was a peaceful, relaxing, and great place to visit. A lot of flowers during spring season (less cherry trees but others yes). If you",
          "A great temple with lots and lots and LOTS of features to discover - and a fantastic view of the sea from certain spots. I found the cave a bit claustrophobic and the place got very busy when busloads of tourists showed up all at once, but it's worth a visit.",
          "The temple is located on a hill looking to the beaches of Kamakura. It is very well protected. There are eagles flying over the temple and its gardens. It is close to the main train station (withen 1,5 km) but there are also city buses. There are small local shops where you can",
          "Didn\u2019t know this place existed and I\u2019m so glad I found out about it. Walked here and once here it was wow.

          "First of all, DON'T book yourself onto one of the expensive Kamakura day tours - it is easily accessible from Tokyo (took me about an hour on the train from Asakusa area) and Hasedera and Kotoku-in (Big Buddha) are within 10 minutes walk of Hase train station, and you can't go",
          "An incredibile mini tour with an amazing temple on the top with a great gold Buddha inside of it! During the tour you can admire a lot of sculputers, caves and gardens!",
          "Hase\u2013dera Temple has a beautiful grounds. There\u2018s a small bamboo forrest at the side. We had lunch at their restaurant. The price was acceptable. There\u2018s also a viewing deck a short hike up. We visited the Temple and Kamakura which is a walking distance from each other.",
          "I went here straight from visiting the great Buddha statue about 400 metre from here. Beautiful weather and sunset. You gotta come here as the last spot you visit in Kamakura before you go back to the JR station. You can use the Hase tram to go there",
          "This is a sacred place where you can be in touch with yourself and even if you are not a Buddhism believer you can feel a special energy that comes from the whole surroundings",
          "A beautiful temple of lord Buddha. Absolutely stunning and beautiful. Breadth taking views. Keep some time for this temple.",
          "It is really quiet and beautiful. Not crowded when we went there ( Dec 2018) You can medidate. Its plain but if you go up to the other temple it has a lot of stairs",
          "Very much recommended to visit this temple, other than Great Kamakura Budha. It is a very impressive temple with intricate carving on the roof, view on Kamakura shore line from the hill, and large temple. It has a small Budha statue in front of the main temple where it is",
          "Pleasant surprise. Didn\u2019t expect that I will be awestrucked by the beauty of this temple. What made it more special is the Eleven headed Kannon. It was truly a sight. A visit to Hasadera makes Kamakura a worth while visit. Absolutely magnificent.",

          "Always a little gem to discover - even if you have been to Kamakira 6 or 7 times... Very attractive Buddhist temple (also known as Hase Kannon), built on two levels \u2013 with an underground cave. The cave, called benten kutsu (Benzaiten Grotto), contains a long winding tunnel with",
          "This review is really for all the temples we visited in Kamakura. It's hard to pick out and review individual ones when you've spent a great day visiting Kamakura. Hasedera is certainly excellent as are most of the sites in their own way. Some are small, peaceful and serene,",
          "I've been to this temple many times before but was my first time this year to go for new years countdown. If you are in town or anywhere close in Japan, totally recommend to go. They sells candle that you can write your name and wish. I think the candle was for 500 yen. No",
          "tHe Hasendera Temple is a short 5 minute walk from the local station in Kankura and, on a fine day, provides spectacular views out across the ocean. You could easily spend 1 hour just taking everything in ......it is such a nice place. There are many steps to the highest part",
          "For me it was the finest of the top 3 attractions of Kamakura (Great Buddha & Hachimangu being the others). The garden, the temples and the breathtaking view of the vicinity from the hilltop made the trip memorable. A meal in the restaurant is worth even for the view it offers",
          "My first temple experience when arriving to Japan and in was not disappointed! The sheer size of it and the construction is really amazing to take in. Plenty of creature comforts for visitors and it doesn't cost anything to visit. Be sure to drink from the fountain of youth.",
          "To me, this is the most beautiful temple among the three I managed to visit in Kamakura. It is located somewhere in between Hase station and Kotokuin Temple (Big Buddha). It also has a small hill top area where you can get a view of the seaside area of Kamakura. Also, it is not",
          "This complex is about three stops from kamakura station. Ascend the steps for a wonderful view of the bay and of kamakura!! There is also a little cave within the temple compound to observe carvings of \"children\" on the walls. There are a few parts where you have to bend over",
          "I\u2019m used to getting to places, especially temples, right when they open. I didn\u2019t manage to do that with Hasedera, so at 11am it was way too crowded for me. I didn\u2019t look around much because of all the people, and I didn\u2019t specifically see anything about it in particular that",

          "At the end of a walking street stands this relatively new looking temple. It is not really as nice as the temples I have seen in other parts of Japan, but for this small area it is worth checking out. Nice view of the sea and near the beach. The cave is also entertaining for",
          "Photography is not allowed inside the grand hall containing the statue of Kannon, but that's actually a good thing because it forces you to experience the moment rather than just click and go (naturally, you can photograph all the Buddhist statues outside).",

          "This was my favorite site on my Kamakura visit. It is great! There is also a restaurant with great views to the city and the sea. There are many steps and hills so be prepared. There are gardens that are well manicured and most interesting. I highly recommend.",
          "This is a popular site, so there may be crowds, but the grounds are large and there are several buildings, a small museum (extra charge) & outdoor viewpoints. The garden at the entrance is lovely; I would have enjoyed some quiet moments there--maybe early in the morning ? There",
          "Only 5min walk from the nearest station (Hase.st) and 5min walk from The Great Buddha. The statue in the main temple was amazing.(One of the biggest Kannon statue that i have ever seen)They have a little cave and this month they will open a museum.",
          "The temple is certainly worth itself the trip to Kamakura. It is big, interesting and offers magnificent views over the bay outside Kamakura. I have some special link with the Jizo-do Hall, it has been a nice internal experience. Highly suggested.",

          "Very tranquil with a lot of interesting information and a stunning view. not to mention a 30 foot tall Buddha made out of a single piece of wood. Well worth a visit and give time to soak up the atmosphere and relax.",

          "Just when you think \"when I have seen one temple and its garden I've seen them all\" this pearl comes along. It's so beautiful you won't know what to do with yourself. This temple's got it all. The raked sand garden, the beautiful temple building, the mini statues of buddhas",
          "Like Kyoto's famous hillside temple, this one also has a storied millenium long history, overlooks the ocean, rather than the city, and retains a link with Shinto, with it's Benzaiten shrine and caves. The centerpiece, the Kannon statue, carved over a thousand years ago, pushed",
          "The Temple is an amazing historical attraction. The statue of Kannon is reported to be one of the largest wooden statues in Japan, is over 30 ft tall, and gilded in gold. It is truly amazing. CAUTION - there is quite a climb of steps to get to the temple.",
          "I went to see this beautiful temple and the park around it. It was peaceful and quiet like most Japanese temples are. I also bought talisman inside the temple to take back home. The view from the temple of Kamakura town are fantastic.",

          "Enjoyed my visit but didn't wait in the long queue for the walk around the gardens as the path that I could see seemed incredibly busy and slow moving. It was a good area to visit but I didn't get too much extra value from going into the site. Interesting but with little",
          "Hasedera is a bit less crowded then the temple with the great Daibutsu (Kotokuin), and absolutely worth a stop. The temple is perched on a hill with views of the ocean (and on a nice day windsurfers in the distance). The rows of small jizo statues are very beautiful and set",
          "This is a rather unique temple, built on a mountain slope. The temple features hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of statues in various sizes and shapes. Entrance ticket is 3US$ and is totally worth it, especially if you climb all the way up for some stunning views of the coast of",

          "I loved every minute of my journey to Japan, it was very short though. I was very happy to visit other places then just busy Tokyo and our friend brought us to Kamakura. Hasedera temple is rigorous indigenous temple and at the same time very beautiful and relaxing place. I loved",

        "wiki": "Kamakura (\u938c\u5009\u5e02, Kamakura-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. \nKamakura has an estimated population of 172,302 (1 September 2016) and a population density of 4,358.77 persons per km2 over the total area of 39.53 km2 (15.26 sq mi). Kamakura was designated as a city on 3 November 1939.\nKamakura was the de facto capital of Japan from 1185 to 1333 as the seat of the Kamakura Shogunate, and became the nation's most populous settlement from 1200 to 1300 during the Kamakura period. Kamakura is a popular domestic tourist destination in Japan as a coastal city with a high number of seasonal festivals, as well as ancient Buddhist and Shinto shrines and temples.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSurrounded to the north, east, and west by hills and to the south by the open water of Sagami Bay, Kamakura is a natural fortress. Before the construction of several tunnels and modern roads that now connect it to Fujisawa, Ofuna (ja) and Zushi, on land it could be entered only through narrow artificial passes, among which the seven most important were called Kamakura's Seven Entrances (\u938c\u5009\u4e03\u53e3), a name sometimes translated as \"Kamakura's Seven Mouths\". The natural fortification made Kamakura an easily defensible stronghold.Before the opening of the Entrances, access on land was so difficult that the Azuma Kagami reports that H\u014dj\u014d Masako came back to Kamakura from a visit to S\u014dt\u014dzan temple in Izu bypassing by boat the impassable Inamuragasaki cape and arriving in Yuigahama. Again according to the Azuma Kagami, the first of the Kamakura sh\u014dguns, Minamoto no Yoritomo, chose it as a base partly because it was his ancestors' land (his yukari no chi), partly because of these physical characteristics.To the north of the city stands Mt. Genji (Genjiyama) (\u6e90\u6c0f\u5c71) (92 m or 302 ft), which then passes behind the Daibutsu and reaches Inamuragasaki and the sea.From the north to the east, Kamakura is surrounded by Mt. Rokkokuken (\u516d\u56fd\u898b) (147 m or 482 ft), Mt. \u014chira (\u5927\u5e73\u5c71) (159 m or 522 ft), Mt. Jubu (\u9df2\u5cf0\u5c71) (127 m or 417 ft), Mt. Tendai (\u5929\u53f0\u5c71)(141 m or 463 ft), and Mt. Kinubari (\u8863\u5f35\u5c71) (120 m or 390 ft), which extend all the way to Iijimagasaki and Wakae Island, on the border with Kotsubo and Zushi. From Kamakura's alluvional plain branch off numerous narrow valleys like the Urigayatsu, Shakad\u014dgayatsu, \u014cgigayatsu, Kamegayatsu, Hikigayatsu, and Matsubagayatsu valleys. (The ending \"\u30f6\u8c37\" meaning \"valley\", common in place names and usually read \"-gaya\", in Kamakura is pronounced \"-gayatsu\").\nKamakura is crossed by the Namerigawa river, which goes from the Asaina Pass in northern Kamakura to the beach in Yuigahama for a total length of about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi). The river marks the border between Zaimokuza and Yuigahama.\nIn administrative terms, the municipality of Kamakura borders with Yokohama to the north, with Zushi to the east, and with Fujisawa to the west. It includes many areas outside the Seven Entrances as Yamanouchi, Koshigoe (\u8170\u8d8a), Shichirigahama, and Ofuna (ja), and is the result of the fusion of Kamakura proper with the cities of Koshigoe, absorbed in 1939, Ofuna, absorbed in 1948, and with the village of Fukasawa, absorbed in 1948.\n\n\n=== Kita-Kamakura (Yamanouchi) ===\n\nNorthwest of Kamakura lies Yamanouchi, commonly called Kita-Kamakura because of the presence of East Japan Railway Company's (JR) Kita-Kamakura Station. Yamanouchi, however, was technically never a part of historical Kamakura since it is outside the Seven Entrances. Yamanouchi was the northern border of the city during the shogunate, and the important Kobukorozaka and Kamegayatsu Passes, two of Kamakura's Seven Entrances, led directly to it. Its name at the time used to be Sakado-g\u014d (\u5c3a\u5ea6\u90f7). The border post used to lie about a hundred meters past today's Kita-Kamakura train station in Ofuna's direction.Although very small, Yamanouchi is famous for its traditional atmosphere and the presence, among others, of three of the five highest-ranking Rinzai Zen temples in Kamakura, the Kamakura Gozan (\u938c\u5009\u4e94\u5c71). These three great temples were built here because Yamanouchi was the home territory of the H\u014dj\u014d clan, a branch of the Taira clan which ruled Japan for 150 years. Among Kita-Kamakura's most illustrious citizens were artist Isamu Noguchi and movie director Yasujir\u014d Ozu. Ozu is buried at Engaku-ji.\n\n\n== Wakamiya \u014cji and the shogunate's six avenues ==\n\nKamakura's defining feature is Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, a Shinto shrine in the center of the city. A 1.8-kilometre (1.1 mi) road (\u53c2\u9053, sand\u014d) runs from Sagami Bay directly to the shrine. This road is known as Wakamiya \u014cji, the city's main street. Built by Minamoto no Yoritomo as an imitation of Kyoto's Suzaku \u014cji, Wakamiya \u014cji used to be much wider, delimited on both sides by a 3 metre deep canal and flanked by pine trees.Walking from the beach toward the shrine, one passes through three torii, or Shinto gates, called respectively Ichi no Torii (first gate), Ni no Torii (second gate) and San no Torii (third gate). Between the first and the second lies Geba Yotsukado which, as the name indicates, was the place where riders had to get off their horses in deference to Hachiman and his shrine.Approximately 100 metres after the second torii, the dankazura, a raised pathway flanked by cherry trees that marks the center of Kamakura, begins. The dankazura becomes gradually wider so that it will look longer than it really is when viewed from the shrine. Its entire length is under the direct administration of the shrine. Minamoto no Yoritomo made his father-in-law H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa and his men carry by hand the stones to build it to pray for the safe delivery of his son Yoriie. The dankazura used to go all the way to Geba, but it was drastically shortened during the 19th century to make way for the newly constructed Yokosuka railroad line.In Kamakura, wide streets are called \u014cji (\u5927\u8def)\u3001narrower ones K\u014dji (\u5c0f\u8def), the small streets that connect the two are called zushi (\u8fbb\u5b50), and intersections tsuji (\u8fbb). Komachi \u014cji and Ima K\u014dji run respectively east and west of Wakamiya \u014cji, while Yoko \u014cji, the road that passes right under San no Torii, and \u014cmachi \u014cji, which goes from Kotsubo to Geba and Hase, run in the east\u2013west direction. Near the remains of Hama no \u014ctorii runs Kuruma \u014cji Avenue (also called Biwa Koji). These six streets (three running north to south and three east to west) were built at the time of the shogunate and are all still under heavy use. The only one to have been modified is Kuruma \u014cji, a segment of which has disappeared.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe earliest traces of human settlements in the area date back at least 10,000 years. Obsidian and stone tools found at excavation sites near J\u014draku-ji were dated to the Old Stone Age (between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago). During the J\u014dmon period, the sea level was higher than now and all the flat land in Kamakura up to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and, further east, up to Yokohama's Totsuka-ku and Sakae-ku was under water. Thus, the oldest pottery fragments found come from hillside settlements of the period between 7500 BC and 5000 BC. In the late J\u014dmon period the sea receded and civilization progressed. During the Yayoi period (300 BC\u2013300 AD), the sea receded further almost to today's coastline, and the economy shifted radically from hunting and fishing to farming.The Azuma Kagami describes pre-shogunate Kamakura as a remote, forlorn place, but there is reason to believe its writers simply wanted to give the impression that prosperity had been brought there by the new regime. To the contrary, it is known that by the Nara period (about 700 AD) there were both temples and shrines. Sugimoto-dera for example was built during this period and is therefore one of the city's oldest temples. The town was also the seat of area government offices and the point of convergence of several land and marine routes. It seems therefore only natural that it should have been a city of a certain importance, likely to attract Yoritomo's attention.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Kamakura appears in the Kojiki of 712, and is also mentioned in the c. 8th century Man'y\u014dsh\u016b as well as in the Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d of 938. However, the city clearly appears in the historical record only with Minamoto no Yoritomo's founding of the Kamakura shogunate in 1192.\nThere are various hypotheses about the origin of the name. According to the most likely theory, Kamakura, surrounded as it is on three sides by mountains, was likened both to a cooking hearth (\u7ac3, kamado, kama) and to a warehouse (\u5009, kura), because both only have one side open.Another and more picturesque explanation is a legend, relating how Fujiwara no Kamatari stopped at Yuigahama on his way to today's Ibaraki Prefecture, where he wanted to pray at the Kashima Shrine for the fall of Soga no Iruka. He dreamed of an old man who promised his support, and upon waking, he found next to his bed a type of spear called a kamayari. Kamatari enshrined it in a place called \u014ckura. Kamayari plus \u014ckura then turned into the name Kamakura. However, this and similar legends appear to have arisen only after Kamatari's descendant Fujiwara no Yoritsune became the fourth sh\u014dgun of the Kamakura shogunate in 1226, some time after the name Kamakura appears in the historical record. It used to be also called Renpu (\u938c\u5e9c) (short for Kamakura Bakufu (\u938c\u5009\u5e55\u5e9c, or Kamakura Shogunate)).\n\n\n=== Kamakura period ===\n\nThe extraordinary events, the historical characters and the culture of the twenty years which go from Minamoto no Yoritomo's birth to the assassination of the last of his sons have been throughout Japanese history the background and the inspiration for countless poems, books, jidaigeki TV dramas, Kabuki plays, songs, manga and even videogames; and are necessary to make sense of much of what one sees in today's Kamakura.\nYoritomo, after the defeat and almost complete extermination of his family at the hands of the Taira clan, managed in the space of a few years to go from being a fugitive hiding from his enemies inside a tree trunk to being the most powerful man in the land. Defeating the Taira clan, Yoritomo became de facto ruler of much of Japan and founder of the Kamakura shogunate, an institution destined to last 141 years and to have immense repercussions over the country's history.\nThe Kamakura shogunate era is called by historians the Kamakura period and, although its end is clearly set (Siege of Kamakura (1333)), its beginning is not.  Different historians put Kamakura's beginning at a different point in time within a range that goes from the establishment of Yoritomo's first military government in Kamakura (1180) to his elevation to the rank of Sei-i Taish\u014dgun (\u5f81\u5937\u5927\u5c06\u8ecd) in 1192. It used to be thought that during this period, effective power had moved completely from the Emperor in Kyoto to Yoritomo in Kamakura, but the progress of research has revealed this was not the case. Even after the consolidation of the shogunate's power in the east, the Emperor continued to rule the country, particularly its west. However, it's undeniable that Kamakura had a certain autonomy and that it had surpassed the technical capital of Japan politically, culturally and economically. The shogunate even reserved for itself an area in Kyoto called Rokuhara (\u516d\u6ce2\u7f85) where lived its representatives, who were there to protect its interests.\n\nIn 1179, Yoritomo married H\u014dj\u014d Masako, an event of far-reaching consequences for Japan.  In 1180, he entered Kamakura, building his residence in a valley called \u014ckura (in today's Nishi Mikado). The stele on the spot (see photo) reads:\n\n737 years ago, in 1180, Minamoto no Yoritomo built his mansion here. Consolidated his power, he later ruled from home, and his government was therefore called \u014ckura Bakufu (\u5927\u8535\u5e55\u5e9c). He was succeeded by his sons Yoriie and Sanetomo, and this place remained the seat of the government for 46 years until 1225, when his wife H\u014dj\u014d Masako died. It was then transferred to Utsunomiya Tsuji (\u5b87\u6d25\u5bae\u8fbb).\nErected in March 1917 by the Kamakurach\u014d Seinendan\n\nIn 1185, his forces, commanded by his younger brother Minamoto no Yoshitsune, vanquished the Taira and in 1192 he received from Emperor Go-Toba the title of Sei-i Taish\u014dgun. Yoshitsune's power would however cause Yoritomo's envy; the relationship between the brothers soured, and in 1189 Yoritomo was given Yoshitsune's head pickled in liquor. For the same reason, in 1193 he had his other brother Noriyori killed. Power was now firmly in his hands, but the Minamoto dynasty and its power however were to end as quickly and unexpectedly as they had started.\nIn 1199, Yoritomo died falling from his horse when he was only 51 and was buried in a temple that had until then housed his tutelary goddess. He was succeeded by his 17-year-old son Minamoto no Yoriie under the regency of his maternal grandfather H\u014dj\u014d Tokimasa. A long and bitter fight ensued in which entire clans like the Hatakeyama, the Hiki, and the Wada were wiped out by the H\u014dj\u014d who wished to get rid of Yoritomo's supporters and consolidate their power. Yoriie did become head of the Minamoto clan and was regularly appointed sh\u014dgun in 1202 but by that time, real power had already fallen into the hands of the H\u014dj\u014d clan. Yoriie plotted to take back his power, but failed and was assassinated on July 17, 1204. His six-year-old first son Ichiman had already been killed during political turmoil in Kamakura, while his second son Yoshinari at age six was forced to become a Buddhist priest under the name Kugy\u014d. From then on all power would belong to the H\u014dj\u014d, and the sh\u014dgun would be just a figurehead. Since the H\u014dj\u014d were part of the Taira clan, it can be said that the Taira had lost a battle, but in the end had won the war.\n\nYoritomo's second son and third sh\u014dgun Minamoto no Sanetomo spent most of his life staying out of politics and writing poetry, but was nonetheless assassinated in February 1219 by his nephew Kugy\u014d under the giant ginkgo tree whose trunk still stood at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b until it was uprooted by a storm in the early hours of March 10, 2010. Kugy\u014d himself, the last of his line, was beheaded as a punishment for his crime by the H\u014dj\u014d just hours later. Barely 30 years into the shogunate, the Seiwa Genji dynasty who had created it in Kamakura had ended.In 1293, a severe earthquake killed 23,000 people and seriously damaged the city. In the confusion following the quake, H\u014dj\u014d Sadatoki, the Shikken of the Kamakura shogunate, carried out a purge against his subordinate Taira no Yoritsuna. In what is referred to as the Heizen Gate Incident, Yoritsuna and 90 of his followers were killed.\nThe H\u014dj\u014d regency however continued until Nitta Yoshisada destroyed it in 1333 at the Siege of Kamakura. It was under the regency that Kamakura acquired many of its best and most prestigious temples and shrines, for example Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, Kench\u014d-ji, Engaku-ji, Jufuku-ji, J\u014dchi-ji, and Zeniarai Benten Shrine. The H\u014dj\u014d family crest in the city is therefore still ubiquitous.\nFrom the middle of the thirteenth century, the fact that the vassals (the gokenin) were allowed to become de facto owners of the land they administered, coupled to the custom that all gokenin children could inherit, led to the parcelization of the land and to a consequent weakening of the shogunate. This, and not lack of legitimacy, was the primary cause of the H\u014dj\u014d's fall.\nAccording to The Institute for Research on World-Systems, Kamakura was the 4th largest city in the world in 1250 AD, with 200,000 people, and Japan's largest, eclipsing Kyoto by 1200 AD. Yet, despite Kamakura's annihilation of Kyoto-based political and military power at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185, and the failure of the Emperor to free himself from Kamakura's control during the J\u014dky\u016b War, Takahashi (2005) has questioned whether Kamakura's nationwide political hegemony actually existed. Takahashi claims that if Kamakura ruled the Kant\u014d, not only was the Emperor in fact still the ruler of Kansai, but during this period the city was in many ways politically and administratively still under the ancient capital of Kyoto. Kamakura was simply a rival center of political, economic and cultural power in a country that had Kyoto as its capital.\n\n\n==== Fall of the Kamakura shogunate ====\n\nOn July 3, 1333, warlord Nitta Yoshisada, who was an Emperor loyalist, attacked Kamakura to reestablish imperial rule. After trying to enter by land through the Kewaizaka Pass and the Gokuraku-ji Pass, he and his forces waited for a low tide, bypassed the Inamuragasaki cape, entered the city and took it.In accounts of that disastrous H\u014dj\u014d defeat it is recorded that nearly 900 H\u014dj\u014d samurai, including the last three Regents, committed suicide at their family temple, T\u014dsh\u014d-ji, whose ruins have been found in today's \u014cmachi. Almost the entire clan vanished at once, the city was sacked and many temples were burned. Many simple citizens imitated the H\u014dj\u014d, and an estimated total of over 6,000 died on that day of their own hand. In 1953, 556 skeletons of that period were found during excavations near Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's Ichi no Torii in Yuigahama, all of people who had died of a violent death, probably at the hand of Nitta's forces.\n\n\n=== Muromachi and Edo periods ===\n\nThe fall of Kamakura marks the beginning of an era in Japanese history characterized by chaos and violence called the Muromachi period. Kamakura's decline was slow, and in fact the next phase of its history, in which, as the capital of the Kant\u014d region, it dominated the east of the country, lasted almost as long as the shogunate had. Kamakura would come out of it almost completely destroyed.The situation in Kant\u014d after 1333 continued to be tense, with H\u014dj\u014d supporters staging sporadic revolts here and there. In 1335, H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyuki, son of last regent Takatoki, tried to re-establish the shogunate by force and defeated Kamakura's de facto ruler Ashikaga Tadayoshi in Musashi, in today's Kanagawa Prefecture. He was in his turn defeated in Koshigoe by Ashikaga Takauji, who had come in force from Kyoto to help his brother.Takauji, founder of the Ashikaga shogunate which, at least nominally, ruled Japan during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, at first established his residence at the same site in Kamakura where Yoritomo's \u014ckura Bakufu had been (see above), but in 1336 he left Kamakura in charge of his son Yoshiakira and went west in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada. The Ashikaga then decided to permanently stay in Kyoto, making Kamakura instead the capital of the Kamakura-fu (\u938c\u5009\u5e9c) (or Kant\u014d-fu (\u95a2\u6771\u5e9c)), a region including the provinces of Sagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa, Shim\u014dsa, Hitachi, Kozuke, Shimotsuke, Kai, and Izu, to which were later added Mutsu and Dewa, making it the equivalent to today's Kanto, plus the Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures.\n\nKamakura's ruler was called Kant\u014d kub\u014d, a title equivalent to sh\u014dgun assumed by Ashikaga Takauji's son Motouji after his nomination to Kant\u014d kanrei, or deputy sh\u014dgun, in 1349. Motouji transferred his original title to the Uesugi family, which had previously held the hereditary title of shitsuji (\u57f7\u4e8b), and would thereafter provide the Kant\u014d kanrei. Motouji had been sent by his father because this last understood the importance of controlling the Kant\u014d region and wanted to have an Ashikaga in power there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness, so the sh\u014dgun's idea never really worked and actually backfired. The kant\u014d kub\u014d era is essentially a struggle for the shogunate between the Kamakura and the Kyoto branches of the Ashikaga clan, because both believed they had a valid claim to power. In the end, Kamakura had to be retaken by force in 1454. The five kub\u014d recorded by history, all of Motouji's bloodline, were in order Motouji himself, Ujimitsu, Mitsukane, Mochiuji and Shigeuji. The last kub\u014d had to escape to Koga, in today's Ibaraki prefecture, and he and his descendants thereafter became known as the Koga kub\u014d. According to the Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book published in 1685, more than two centuries later the spot where the kub\u014d's mansion had been was still left empty by local peasants in the hope he may one day return.\nA long period of chaos and war followed the departure of the last Kant\u014d kub\u014d (the Sengoku period). Kamakura was heavily damaged in 1454 and almost completely burned during the Siege of Kamakura (1526). Many of its citizens moved to Odawara when it came to prominence as the home town of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan. The final blow to the city was the decision taken in 1603 by the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns to move the capital to nearby Edo, the place now called Tokyo. The city never recovered and gradually returned to be the small fishing village it had been before Yoritomo's arrival. Edmond Papinot's Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan, published in 1910 during the late Meiji period, describes it as follows:\n\nKamakura. A small town (7250 inh.) in Sagami which for several centuries was the second capital of Japan. ... At present there remain of the splendor of the past only the famous Daibutsu and the Tsurugaoka Hachiman temple.\n\n\n=== Meiji period and the 20th century ===\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kamakura's great cultural assets, its beach, and the mystique that surrounded its name made it as popular as it is now, and for essentially the same reasons. The destruction of its heritage nonetheless didn't stop: during the anti-Buddhist violence of 1868 (haibutsu kishaku) that followed the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (shinbutsu bunri) many of the city temples were damaged. In other cases, because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, shrines or temples had to give away some of their treasures, thus damaging their cultural heritage and decreasing the value of their properties. Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's giant Ni\u014d (\u4ec1\u738b) (the two wooden warden gods usually found at the sides of a Buddhist temple's entrance), for example, being objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, were brought to Jufuku-ji, where they still are.The shrine also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its tah\u014dt\u014d tower, its mid\u014d (\u5fa1\u5802), and its shichid\u014d garan.\n Some Buddhist temples were simply closed, like Zenk\u014d-ji, to which the now-independent Meigetsu-in used to belong.In 1890, the railroad, which until then had arrived just to Ofuna, reached Kamakura bringing in tourists and new residents, and with them a new prosperity. Part of the ancient Dankazura (see above) was removed to let the railway system's new Yokosuka Line pass.\nThe damage caused by time, centuries of neglect, politics, and modernization was further compounded by nature in 1923. The epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake that year was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay, a short distance from Kamakura. Tremors devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, causing widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. It was reported that the sea receded at an unprecedented velocity, and then waves rushed back towards the shore in a great wall of water over seven meters high, drowning some and crushing others beneath an avalanche of waterborne debris. The total death toll from earthquake, tsunami, and fire exceeded 2,000 victims. Large sections of the shore simply slid into the sea; and the beach area near Kamakura was raised up about six-feet; or in other words, where there had only been a narrow strip of sand along the sea, a wide expanse of sand was fully exposed above the waterline.Many temples founded centuries ago have required restoration, and it is for this reason that Kamakura has just one National Treasure in the building category (the Shariden at Engaku-ji). Much of Kamakura's heritage was for various reasons over the centuries first lost and later rebuilt.\n\n\n== Nichiren in Kamakura ==\n\nKamakura is known among Buddhists for having been the cradle of Nichiren Buddhism during the 13th century. Founder Nichiren wasn't a native; he was born in Awa Province, in today's Chiba Prefecture. But it was only natural for a preacher to come here because the city was the political centre of the country at the time. Nichiren settled down in a straw hut in the Matsubagayatsu (literally \"pine needle valley\") district, where three temples (Ankokuron-ji, My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji, and Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji), have been fighting for centuries for the honour of being the true heir of the master. During his turbulent life Nichiren came and went, but Kamakura always remained at the heart of his religious activities. It's here that, when he was about to be executed by the H\u014dj\u014d Regent for being a troublemaker, he was allegedly saved by a miracle; it's in Kamakura that he wrote his famous Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron (\u7acb\u6b63\u5b89\u56fd\u8ad6), or \"Treatise on Peace and Righteousness\"; it's here that legend says he was rescued and fed by monkeys and it's here that he preached.Some Kamakura locations important to Nichiren Buddhism are:\n\nThe three temples in MatsubagayatsuAnkokuron-ji claims to have on its grounds the cave where the master, with the help of a white monkey, hid from his persecutors. (However Hossh\u014d-ji in Zushi's Hisagi district makes the same claim, and with a better historical basis.) Within Ankokuron-ji lie also the spot where Nichiren used to meditate while admiring Mount Fuji, the place where his disciple Nichiro was cremated, and the cave where he is supposed to have written his Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron.Nearby My\u014dh\u014d\u2013ji (also called \"Koke-dera\" or \"Temple of Moss\"), a much smaller temple, was erected in an area where Nichiren had his home for 19 years. The third Nichiren temple in Nagoe, Ch\u014dsh\u014d-ji, also claims to lie on the very spot where it all started.\n\nThe Nichiren Tsujisepp\u014d Ato (\u65e5\u84ee\u8056\u4eba\u8fbb\u8aac\u6cd5\u8de1) on Komachi \u014cji in the Komachi district contains the very stone from which he used to harangue the crowds, claiming that the various calamities that were afflicting the city at the moment were due to the moral failings of its citizens.\nThe former execution ground at Katase's Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji where Nichiren was about to be beheaded (an event known to Nichiren's followers as the Tatsunokuchi Persecution (\u9f8d\u30ce\u53e3\u6cd5\u96e3)), and where he was miraculously saved when thunder struck the executioner. Nichiren had been condemned to death for having written the Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron. Every year, on September 12, Nichiren devotees gather to celebrate the anniversary of the miracle.\nThe Kesagake no Matsu (\u8888\u88df\u639b\u3051\u306e\u677e), the pine tree on the roads between Harisuribashi and Inamuragasaki from which Nichiren hanged his kesa (a Buddhist stole) while on his way to Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji. The original pine tree however died long ago and, after having been replaced many times, now no longer exists.\n\n\n== Notable locations ==\n\nKamakura has many historically significant Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, some of them, like Sugimoto-dera, over 1,200 years old. K\u014dtoku-in, with its monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amida Buddha, is the most famous. A 15th-century tsunami destroyed the temple that once housed the Great Buddha, but the statue survived and has remained outdoors ever since. This iconic Daibutsu is arguably amongst the few images which have come to represent Japan in the world's collective imagination. Kamakura also hosts the so-called Five Great Zen Temples (the Kamakura Gozan).\nThe architectural heritage of Kamakura is almost unmatched, and the city has proposed some of its historic sites for inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list. Although much of the city was devastated in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923, damaged temples and shrines, founded centuries ago, have since been carefully restored.\nSome of Kamakura's highlights are:\n\nThe Asaina Pass and its Kumano Jinja\nAnkokuron-ji\nAn'y\u014d-in\nCh\u014dju-ji, one of Ashikaga Takauji's two \"bodaiji\" (funeral temples)\nEngaku-ji, ranked Number Two among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nHatakeyama Shigeyasu's grave\nH\u014dkai-ji, dedicated to the memory of the H\u014dj\u014d clan\nJ\u014dchi-ji, ranked Number Four among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nJ\u014dmy\u014d-ji temple, ranked Number Five among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nJufuku-ji, ranked Number Three among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples\nHase-dera\nKamakura-g\u016b in Nikaid\u014d, built on the spot where Prince Morinaga, son of Emperor Go-Daigo, was imprisoned and then beheaded by Ashikaga Tadayoshi in 1335.\nKamakura Museum of National Treasures\nKanagawa Prefectural Ofuna Botanical Garden\nKench\u014d-ji, ranked Number One among Kamakura's Great Zen Temples and, together with Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, the pride of the city\nK\u014dmy\u014d-ji\nK\u014dtoku-in and its Great Buddha\nThe Kamakura Museum of Literature, the former villa of Marquises Maeda\nMeigetsu-in\nMoto Hachiman\nMy\u014dhon-ji\n\u014cfuna Kannon\nTatsunokuchi, where Mongol emissaries were beheaded and buried.\nKatase's Ry\u016bk\u014d-ji\nSasuke Inari Shrine Sasuke Inari Shrine and Hidden Village\nSugimoto-dera\nThe Shakad\u014d Pass (see description below)\nT\u014dkei-ji, famous in the past as a refuge for battered women\nTomb of Minamoto no Yoritomo\nTsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, symbol of the city\nWakamiya \u014cji Avenue with its three torii and cherry trees\nYuigahama, a popular beach\nTamanawa Castle, Castle ruins of Later H\u014dj\u014d clan\nZeniarai Benzaiten Shrine, where visitors go to wash their coins\nZuisen-ji, funeral temple of the Ashikaga kub\u014d, rulers in Kamakura during the early Muromachi period\n\n\n== Festivals and other events ==\n\nKamakura has many festivals (matsuri (\u796d\u308a)) and other events in each of the seasons, usually based on its rich historical heritage. They are often sponsored by private businesses and, unlike those in Kyoto, they are relatively small-scale events attended mostly by locals and a few tourists. January in particular has many because it's the first month of the year, so authorities, fishermen, businesses and artisans organize events to pray for their own health and safety, and for a good and prosperous working year. Kamakura's numerous temples and shrines, first among them city symbols Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and Kench\u014d-ji, organize many events too, bringing the total to over a hundred.\n\n\n=== January ===\n4th \u2013 Ch\u014dna-hajimeshiki (\u624b\u65a7\u521d\u5f0f) at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b: This event marks the beginning of the working year for local construction workers who, for the ceremony, use traditional working tools. The festival also commemorates Minamoto no Yoritomo, who ordered the reconstruction of the main building of the shrine after it was destroyed by fire in 1191. The ceremony takes place at 1:00 pm at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b.\n\n\n=== February ===\nDay before the first day of spring (usually Feb. 3) \u2013  Setsubun Matsuri (\u7bc0\u5206\u796d) at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b, Kench\u014d-ji, Hase-dera, Kamakura-g\u016b, etc. : Celebration of the end of winter. Beans are scattered in the air to ensure good luck.\n\n\n=== April ===\n2nd to 3rd Sunday: Kamakura Matsuri at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b and other locations: A whole week of events that celebrate the city and its history.\n\n\n=== May ===\n5th \u2013  Kusajishi (\u8349\u9e7f) at the Kamakura Shrine: Archers in samurai gear shoot arrows at a straw deer while reciting old poems.\n\n\n=== August ===\n10th (or following Monday if it falls on a Saturday)- A full hour of fireworks on the beach in Yuigahama.\n\n\n=== September ===\n14th, 15th and 16th \u2013  Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b Reitaisai (\u9db4\u5ca1\u516b\u5e61\u5bae\u4f8b\u5927\u796d): Famous festival with many attractions, the most famous of which is the Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac), or Japanese horseback archery, which takes place on the 16th.\n\n\n== Shakad\u014d Pass ==\n\nBesides the Seven Entrances there is another great pass in the city, the huge Shakad\u014d Pass (\u91c8\u8fe6\u5802\u5207\u901a), which connects Shakad\u014dgayatsu to the \u014cmachi and Nagoe (formerly called Nagoshi) districts.\nAccording to the plaque near the pass itself, the name derives from the fact that third Shikken H\u014dj\u014d Yasutoki built here a Shakad\u014d (a Buddhist temple devoted to Shakyamuni) dedicated to his father Yoshitoki's memory. The original location of the temple is unclear, but it was closed some time in the middle Muromachi period. The Shaka Nyorai statue that is supposed to have been its main object of cult has been declared an Important Cultural Property and is conserved at Daien-ji in Meguro, Tokyo.Although important, the pass was not considered one of the Entrances because it connected two areas both fully within Kamakura. Its date of creation is unclear, as it's not explicitly mentioned in any historical record, and it could be therefore recent. It seems very likely however that a pass which connected the Kanazawa Road to the Nagoe area called Inukakezaka (\u72ac\u61f8\u5742) and mentioned in the Genpei J\u014dsuiki (\u6e90\u5e73\u76db\u54c0\u8a18) in relation to an 1180 war in Kotsubo between the Miura clan and the Hatakeyama clan is indeed the Shakad\u014d Pass. In any case, the presence of two yagura tombs (see the following section) within it means that it can be dated to at least the Kamakura period. It was then an important way of transit, but it was also much narrower than today and harder to pass.Inside the pass, there are two small yagura tombs containing some gorint\u014d. On the Shakad\u014dgayatsu side of the pass, just before the first houses a small street on the left takes to a large group of yagura called Shakad\u014dgayatsu Yagura-gun. There rest the bones of some of the hundreds of H\u014dj\u014d family members who committed suicide at T\u014dsh\u014d-ji after the fall of Kamakura in 1333.The pass appears many times in some recent Japanese films like \"The Blue Light\", Tada, Kimi o Aishiteru, and \"Peeping Tom\" (\u771f\u6728\u6817\u30ce\u7a74, Makiguri no ana). The pass is presently closed to all traffic because of the danger posed by falling rocks.\nOn April 28, 2010, a day of heavy rain, a large section of rock on the Omachi side of the Shakado Pass gave way, making the road temporarily impassable for pedestrians.\n\n\n== Yagura tombs ==\n\nAn important and characteristic feature of Kamakura is a type of grave called yagura (\u3084\u3050\u3089). Yagura are caves dug on the side of hills during the Middle Ages to serve as tombs for high-ranking personalities and priests. Two famous examples are H\u014dj\u014d Masako's and Minamoto no Sanetomo's cenotaphs in Jufuku-ji's cemetery, about 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) from Kamakura Station.\nUsually present in the cemetery of most Buddhist temples in the town, they are extremely numerous also in the hills surrounding it, and estimates of their number always put them in the thousands. Yagura can be found either isolated or in groups of even 180 graves, as in the Hyakuhachi Yagura (\u767e\u516b\u3084\u3050\u3089). Many are now abandoned and in a bad state of preservation.The reason why they were dug is not known, but it is thought likely that the tradition started because of the lack of flat land within the narrow limits of Kamakura's territory. Started during the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), the tradition seems to have declined during the following Muromachi period, when storehouses and cemeteries came to be preferred.\nTrue yagura can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and even in distant Awa Province (Chiba).Tombs in caves can also be found in the T\u014dhoku region, near Hiroshima and Kyoto, and in Ishikawa Prefecture, however they are not called yagura and their relationship with those in Kanagawa Prefecture is unknown.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nJR East's Yokosuka Line has three stations within the city. \u014cfuna Station is the northernmost. Next is Kita-Kamakura Station. In the center of the city is Kamakura Station, the central railway station in the city.\nKamakura Station is the terminal for the Enoshima Electric Railway. This railway runs westward to Fujisawa, and part of its route runs parallel to the seashore. After leaving Kamakura Station, trains make eight more station stops in the city. One of them is Hase Station, closest to Hase-dera and K\u014dtoku-in.  The next station on the line is Gokurakuji Station, one of the settings for the 2014 film Our Little Sister.\n\n\n=== Highway ===\nNational Route 134\n\n\n== Education ==\nKamakura has many educational facilities. The city operates sixteen public elementary schools and nine middle schools. The national government has one elementary and one middle school, and there are two private elementary and six private middle schools. At the next level are four prefectural and six private high schools. Also in Kamakura is a prefectural special school.\nKamakura Women's University is the city's sole university.\n\n\n== Government and administration ==\nKamakura has a mayor and a city council, all publicly elected. The mayor is Takashi Matsuo (Politician). The City Council consists of 28 members.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nKamakura has six sister cities. Three are in Japan and three are overseas:\nNice, France (1966)\nUeda, Nagano, Japan (1979)\nHagi, Yamaguchi, Japan (1979)\nAshikaga, Tochigi, Japan (1982)\nDunhuang, China (1998)\nNashville, Tennessee, USA (2014)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHall, John Whitney, Peter Duus (1990).

          "Despite the crowd, our family really enjoyed our visit to this particular shrine. It is situated in a lovely park setting and once you get to the top of the landing of the shrine, the view was quite impressive. The shrine was originally built in 1063 and is the most important",
          "By far my favourite shrine in Kamakura. It was incredibly tranquil and shrouded in mist when we arrived - a lovely sight to behold. There are shops upstairs where you can buy charms. Admission is free.",
          "Our experience was probably clouded by the fact that this shinto shrine was so busy after we had just come from the peaceful tranquility of the Buddhist temple along the road. Having said that the setting is quite pretty but the architecture is typical - nothing particularly",
          "During our visit to Kamakura we visited the Traditional Shrine . It was a beautiful park like environment with the large shrine at the top and a much smaller shrine building at the base of the staircase. So many weddings were being performed at the smaller building. It was",

          "Should not deflect you from visiting this site. I rather liked the same barrels outside of the Shrine. There ar3 some smaller shrines on th site. This was probably the most impressive shrine in Kanakura, but not the best.",
          "Tsurugaoka Hachimangu is a shrine only 10-15 minutes walk from Kamakura Station. The shrine has a huge estate with lots to observe and entertain. Regardless ages, there are things to do. There are worshippers, tourists, kindergarten students, etc. Of course, there are many",

          "I went here by bicycle from the port of Yokohama. The route I took was about 54 km RT but I would not recommend it for everyone. The reason is the poor bicycle infrastructure in Japan. Most cyclists ride on the sidewalks, but speeds are limited because of pedestrians,",
          "Lovely visit in October sunshine. The temple is at the end of the main shopping street in Kamakura. The main building sits on top of a wooded hill and is very picturesque. Just like other temples you cannot take photos of the shrine but there are plenty of other photo",
          "We visited this shrine in the late evening and it was very nice: the shrine was illuminated creating a nice effect. Since most tempples and shrines in Japan close quite early, it's quite unusual to see one in the dark. It was a nice sight.",
          "Ok so you've heard about this and want to catch it. First tip get here early, the event starts at 1pm but if you want a good photo spot try 11am to 11.30 to get a good place. Bring something to sit on like a plastic sheet or something you don't mind getting dirty. No flash,",

          "Exploring the medieval ancient city of Kamakura is not complete without a visit to this most important shrine founded in 1063. The shrine is reached via a long, wide approach that leads from Kamakura's city center, passing through multiple torii gates along the way. The main",

          "This is one of the larger shrines that we visited. There are many steps to climb to get up to the shrine itself. You are discouraged from stopping on the steps to take pictures by various guards. We were lucky enough to have a guide who explained all of the various statues, etc.",
          "It\u2019s a walking distance from Kamakura station. Probably you take Komachi street to Hachimangu where you find lots of shops and restaurants.

          "A must visit for any tourists .such choices of restaurants .we took a taxi ride from the hotel . Reasonable prices . Some restaurants have dance shows",
          "Chinatown was fun there were plenty of interesting shops and a bewildering choice of food from plethora of rstaurants. it is truly daunting and much against my better judgement chose my meal from pictures!! however, the noodles, soup, dumplings, pickle and fruit were all great",
          "Awesome place to spend time and to eat great food. Has some cool.shops to buy souvenirs bit expensive though. Very nice vibrant place and don't forget to walk back to yamashita park and the beach side stroll. If you are in yokohama, this is the best place to be, apart from",
          "The place was interesting and full of colour & vibrancy. We didn't stop to eat but there is a huge array of restaurants offering meals & snacks. I've only given it a 3 as it's very much the same as many other Chinatowns in other cities. Definitely go if you haven't been to a",
          "Went a walk around this today in the rain and visited the temple that is under construction and the man at the door was lovely and showed us around. Visited the hedgehog cafe and then had these fab pork ball things in a take away that you can see them being made! They are",
          "Visiting Yokohama the past several years has been a treat, because the Intercontinental hotel area is still going strong, and Chinatown in Yokohama is still about the same style as years ago!",
          "After spending time in London's Chinatown, we now realise we have been spoilt. Terrible food (2 different meals, different places) means we would not go to Chinatown again, and why did we even go when so much of the Japanese food had been excellent.",
          "Came here to eat on our first night in Japan - there's a massive range of restaurants and a good atmosphere",
          "I was in Chinatown on a busy Sunday and it was heaving with people. There are lot of reasonable priced restaurants however I just grabbed some amazing steamed buns from a place I can't find on TripAdvisor. Worth taking your time to walk about and soak up the atmosphere.",
          "The cleanest China town in the world, and also the best. People from all over Japan also see it as an attraction, that means it must be good if it attracts locals. Many restaurants with different cuisines, also interesting shops.",
          "A very bustling area of town, very much worth the walk to. The streets were bustling and exciting with many great places to eat.",
          "This is China Town colourful chaos. It is so busy but full of life - so many places to eat and/or buy stuff. Enclosed by a series of magnificent gates - even the car park looks themed.",
          "Like most Chinatowns it was very colourful and busy. Mostly food but no one hassled you to visit. We had a good dim sum meal at a reasonable rice.",
          "Yokohama China Town\u2026what can I say. It's a busy, crowded place, like all things in Japan. The challenge here is to find a good place to eat, wher to spend your money and fill your stomach with exactly what you want. Good Luck! It is very hit and miss. But, just take a stab at",
          "One of the best Chinatowns I've visited - it's huge, buzzing atmosphere, we enjoyed having lunch there.",
          "Lively Chinatown with lots of shops and famed for over 250 restaurants. We did street food for starters and sat in a restaurant for mains. Look out for the Peking Duck restaurant which is fabulous!",
          "Well worth the time. Go hungry there are so many great things to eat. It is a visual treat as well with more than the mind can absorb. Look for the panda bau buns.",
          "Good place to get the feel of chinatown as well as some chinese cuisine and buffet - the queue for the hot bun and xiao long bao is too long too but you can feel the vibrant and activities in this busy street",
          "This was an awesome area to visit. Last stop on the subway and an easy walk from the station. The food was great. Especially the soup dumplings! We also visited the hedgehog cafe and would recommend it.",
          "But, having been to Bangkok's China town this one is not that great and feels like a big tourist trap. So I don't recommend visiting Yokohama for it.",
          "Decided to have a walk around waiting before being able to board our cruise ship. Interesting place, lots of food and drink stall along with shops. Friendly people and not hassled which made it more enjoyable. Was a bit of rubbish around after the Typoon and a bit hot and humid.",
          "It\u2019s basically a shopping and food street. Clearly targeted at tourists. Good for a walk around, and there are plenty of restaurants there catering to all food types, so you won\u2019t be hungry. Can get very crowded with tourists, so if you\u2019re not big on crowded areas, this may not",
          "We have been to Japan many times over the last 2 decades. When in Yokohama we visit Chinatown for sushi, sashimi and black sesame ice cream. The place is lively and vibrant especially at night. The food variety is exciting and reasonably priced. Eat what the locals eat and",
          "We were told this is the largest Chinatown outside of China. Not sure if this is true, but it is still a most interesting place to visit. We had dinner here one night. The restaurants vary in cost from very inexpensive to quite costly. But there's lot to choose from to suit",
          "It is not unlike other Chinatowns in major cities in Japan or other countries with all its hustle and bustle surrounding the numerous Japanese-Chinese restaurants and shops selling sundry goods and trinkets. The outstanding point is perhaps the explosion of colours of the place",
          "Just an ordinary China Town for me. If you have some time to spare while in Yokohama, then you can have a stop by.",
          "A nice area to walk around. It is not like other Chinatowns and is quite touristy. Lots of restaurants if you are after something different.",
          "Streets of Chinese foods. Amazing. Many stalls offer familiar food such as bubble tea, little dumplings, and many more. Japanese and many other cuisine foods are offered too. Near yokohama station exit.",
          "Fun and vibrant place that is full of life and colour. Rarely quiet this bustling centre of all things Chinese in Japan is a must see. A huge variety of shops and eateries selling delicious food at every step of the way.",
          "My wife was born in Yokohama and she came here as a child , it\u2019s vibrant and full of life , lights and variety we decided after 40 years to come back and visit , we had a really great time , would recommend as an alternative to Japanese food and culture while in Japan..",
          "Apparently it's one of the largest Chinatown's in the world, but doesn't feel big to be honest. Easy to find and easy to walk around. Good atmosphere, plenty of street food and restaurants and of course the obligatory tut shops and tourist traps.",
          "Went to do shopping for cheap things and to eat Chinese street food, also both oolong tea , in china town you can have the best oolong tea,actually it is always cloudy there until midnight",
          "The place is not too big but there are too many good food there. Lots of restaurants and street food. Love the desserts store too! Definitely the highlight of Yokohama.",
          "Yokohama Chinatown is like any other china towns offering many shops, restaurants.. Do not expect much but it's good for a quick visit",
          "The complex is huge with a lot of various chinese restaurant and store. Better have a map or you will get lost there",
          "This place is big. And with so many restaurants it\u2019s almost impossible to choose from. In the end we decided to follow the lines and eat where there was crowd trying to get in. That paid off. The food we had was fabulous. So much to see as well. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "The two times we visited Chinatown was during Golden Week so you would expect the place to be buzzing - which is an understatement - it was packed - wall-to-wall full of people. In fact we were on the Akai Kutsu (Hop-On Hop-Off) bus and the journey that should have taken 10",
          "It isnt too big, but if you're in the mood for some chinese food or street foods, give it here a try. You can probably do some gift shopping as well as some street food shopping as well. Duration of about 1-2 hrs might be good for this area.",
          "Our local friend suggested we go have lunch in Chinatown. We had actually been to Beijing a year ago so it was fun to see the Japanese version. It was very cool to walk through and have lots of things to take photos of. We stumbled upon an excellent chinese restaurant that we",
          "Very typical China town. Chinese goods and resturants of all types Cantonese and Szechwan. Greta way to spend some time in Yokohama. Very old China town here with a long history",
          "Fantastic district with hundreds of restaurants and different shops. A must place to go in Yokohama.",
          "Absolutely worth a walk around! Day or night it is really something to see. We were walking around until 11 pm and felt totally safe! We bought some great souvenirs, had awesome street food and were surrounded by unbelievable sights!",
          "Nothing spectacular for a Chinese, but probably interesting for non-Chinese. Most of the shops do not open until after 10am, and many are simply chain shops spread out all over. Also noticed many fortune-telling shops around, targeted at local tourists.",
          "Have ventured to many Chinatowns around the globe however this one is quite sizable and has about four entry gateways. In the evening the signage of the restaurants and storefronts really illuminate the area,very reminiscent of Hong Kong and Macau. Pretty touristy but has",
          "Would be a nice place to experience Chinese foods and culture in a different setting- Japan :). After all, this is one of the largest Chinatown in Japan, and established since 160 years now.",
          "Having been to China, I did enjoy the atmosphere in Yokohama\u2019s China town. The streets had traditional gates, lanterns, and other decorations that tell you exactly where you are. We passed by very early (~9:30am) and the stores and restaurants were just opening but there seemed",
          "As I have been to this place many times but love the cuisine here and every corner has something very good for you and the city Yokohama is the best as it\u2019s big and still the environment very clean green and quite . Love with this place",
          "Easy and fast to get to from Tokyo with just 1 train stop. Also within walking distance from the train station in Yokohama. The grand Chinatown arches are impressive with rolls of eateries & restaurants along the main walkway. We should have tried the street food eateries that",
          "A large number of shops and restaurants. Lots of choices, and a shrine. Can be a very busy area. Lots of fun to visit.",
          "Yokohama Chinatown is considered to be the largest in Japan. And even in the world. I doubt about the world, because I've been in many. I can't even remember all: Santo Domingo, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, Bangkok, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore. I",
          "I went to have a quick look as it's so famous. I arrived in the evening and with the lights, it's very atmospheric. There are a lot of Chinese restaurants, but there are also Chinese cake/pastry shops, other smaller cafes, sushi places and souvenir shops. I tried a little xiao",
          "The lights were fantastic in the evening, many types of restaurants, fun to explore. Many small shops selling interesting items.",
          "I visited Yokohama China town back in 2005. It has certainly changed and the only thing that I can recognize is the temple. What brought me back is the atmosphere. I love the crowd, the buildings and the eatery. It makes me feel like I am in China but cleaner... Highly",
          "I had great time waking around. Chinatown Searching for resturat and sights It's was really great experience",

          "The atmosphere was gut but it was quite hectic. Nice small shops and restaurants. Good place to go for a little Walk.",
          "It was a very busy place .There are lots of restaurants to choose from not just Chinese food.Lots of souvenirs shops.There some side streets with red papers lanterns",
          "Bring your Spirit of Eater and try Chinese food and Japoneses in a street full of stores. The decorations are unique.",
          "Walking around Chinatown was awesome, great dim sum and Chinese food. There were two beautiful temples with incredible architecture. Several streets had decor over the entrances. Many restaurants offer all you can eat options, but these are not buffet style you order off the",
          "It takes about an hour from Tokyo to get to Chinatown and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s really worth it. There isn\u2019t much to do there and all the restaurants sell the same things - shanghai dumplings, roast duck, the same types of rice and noodle dishes. We went to the animal cafe",
          "China Town in Yokohama, very crowded, there are many restaurants options along the way, but worth visiting",
          "This is a nice Chinatown with lots of good food options. It is very crowded and a bit hard to get around, but worth visiting.",
          "This is a Small china town in which vendors sell the same goods. This neighborhood gets packed. The food is meh.",
          "Crazy, packed, busy and FUN! We were in Chinatown on a holiday for Spring Solstice, and we were so fortunate to see a parade and all sorts of fun stuff! We bought trinkets, ate steamed pork buns and just enjoyed ourselves!! Bring comfy shoes, a backpack and money for all the",
          "The area itself is picturesque but it is very touristy Basically it is restaurants, palm readers and knic knack shops over and over again. We enjoyed walking around for about 40 minutes but we have been in larger and more authentic china towns elsewhere in the world. I",
          "This is a great Chinatown! Food was awesome and we had fun just walking around and doing some people watching.",
          "This is a fun large Chinatown with food everywhere. Most businesses seem to sell food with lots promoting all you can eat lunch deals ranging from \u00a51680 to \u00a51980. But our advice is to ignore these and queue for food off street side stalls. We had soup dumplings, fried",
          "Not an amazing tourist spot, unless you are staying nearby. We spent an hour travel there from Tokyo, not too far however we found that the whole street in Chinatown basically is selling the same food and same products. It\u2019s not amazing but could make a very short visit for a",
          "Chinatown is an eclectic mix of shops, healers, food stalls, restaurants, and bars and well worth a visit.",
          "all kinds of foods , goodies &souveniers you can find in Yokohama Chinatown..accessible to train station & other parks ..a must see part of yokohama.",
          "If you are looking for some Chinese food for lunch this is the place to be. Some shopping can also be done in this corner of Yokohama.",
          "As its name suggests, China Town is a small china in Japan. You can eat the best of Chinese food while in Japan. The advantage is that it is located close to many tourist attractions of Yokohama such as Land Mark Tower, Red Bricks shopping mall and others. worth knowing",
          "Busy couple of streets, noisy, interesting restaurant window displays to look at. I can imagine it gets busy when Chinese New Year is celebrated. Supposed to be the cleanest Chinatown in the world",
          "Yokohama chinatown ( apparently largest in the world ) was amazing. The streets strewn with lanterns and lights stretch on and on and on seemingly never ending as you wander past Chinese shops and restaurants. As I let myself get lost in the streets I felt as if I was really in",
          "My partner and I had a great time exploring China Town. It has some amazing Chinese shrines. The detail is fantastic. Loads to do, see and enjoy",
          "One of the biggest Chinatown in Japan. Housed over 300 shops. Honestly I have not been able to cover the whole area even though I have been there a few times. Still get lost in the maze of all the Chinese shops. I sometimes wonder how the shops survive by selling the same food",
          "We had lunch at Chinatown the day we arrived and it was its usual high standard. The restaurants and tea rooms are all excellent and just comes down to what you prefer. It is still the best Chinatown I've been to.",
          "Despite being in Japan which is a great place to explore, spending time in China Town in Yokohama is a must. For the food lovers this is the place to be as the fragrances of China and South East Asia envelop your senses. Dont hesitate to stroll along the back alleys where some",
          "We arrived by Princess Cruise ship and took a cab to Chinatown. This is a pretty big area to walk and checkout. The area has around 250 Chinese owned businesses. Exploring the many street and alleyways is half the fun when visiting. If you are into photography, this is a",
          "Wonderful street food and a raft of restaurants to choose from. Would highly recommend a walk down this area\u2019s various streets and alley ways - there\u2019s something for everyone!",
          "We stayed at the hotel in Yokohama and visited this China Town. This one of the tourist attraction in Yokohama. We have spent there about two hours just walking the street, trying Chinese food and enjoying the crowd. Vet clean, colorful and comfortable place to spend some time.",
          "When I 1st went here many years ago. It had a quaint feeling with street vendors that worked under canopies that had clothes hanginv above them from the apartments above. It is now mondern streets with lots of shops and resturants. The food is excellant and we went there",
          "A friend took us here - so many streets of yummy Chinese snacks and comfort food, Chinese temple, and shops selling everything - we found the side streets had cheaper pork buns than in the main tourist streets.",
          "This is a very unique Chinatown and well worth a stroll around. Lots of restaurants and shops to buy gifts. Also well worth taking a photo or two.",
          "Had recommendations to come to the biggest Chinatown in Japan. But other than many restaurants that sell similar Chinese food (and these were just average in taste but tourist-priced!), there was nothing exciting about the place. Nothing to shout about and can be missed!",
          "The Yokohama chinatown can be reach by the subway or walking. We walked from the Cup noodle museum which took about 20 minutes. As it was the winter month, there was cold wind blowing so it was not tiring. The chinatown consist of a few interlinked street filled with shops",
          "A great place to come sightsee, tourist friendly. Many little pockets of surprises in the little alleys lined with lotsa shops and restaurants. I highly recommend to visit the chinese temple While you\u2019re here",
          "quite a few massage parlours, plenty of chinese restaurants, special trip not recommended, visit if you're in Yokohama..",
          "An abundance of restaurants and eclectic shops. The restaurants range from up-scale, to casual, to take out windows. A popular tourist destination and high school field trip spot. I saw multiple groups of teens from different schools shopping and dining in the area.",
          "You only need a 5-minute walk from Ishikawacho Station (by JR) to this place. There is nothing special about this place and like Chinatown in general. You can buy various souvenirs and taste Chinese food in this place. From this place, I walked to Yamashita Park, which is only a",
          "We arrive after a long flight from LAX to Heneda AP and then local bus to Yokohama for boarding our cruise. We walk on block to Chinatown and everything we saw on the internet was right. The whole town is about food, one can pick among 142 dishes, any number of times and as long",
          "A lively China in Yokohama is the best way for me to describe it. Literally thirty seconds across the street from Motomachi-Ch\u016bkagai Station and a five minute walk from Ishikawach\u014d Station. There is a lot of things you can do and see here. Expect a good amount of walking.",
          "Chinatown was packed. There was enough \u201croom\u201d for another couple of people, but not much. That\u2019s the one downside to the Tokyo area. There are a lot of people. A lot. And they were out in full force in Chinatown yesterday. Not as crowded as the Meji shrine in Tokyo last April \u2013",
          "Like all Chinatowns, there are lots of choices and price range to fulfil your personal needs. Very popular to grab some dumplings early on the morning before restaurants open.",
          "Very interesting place, full of shops and restaurants. Looks nice an the evening with illumination of street lights.",
          "Most large cities have a Chinatown and Yokohama is not any different to any of these and this Chinatown is worth a visit albeit much similar to others that you may have visited before",
          "It was ok but not as interesting as it was cracked up to be , part of the problem was that it was raining and a lot of places were not open",
          "We walked around Chinatown on Friday evening. It felt very safe and was clean. There are many restaurants and shops. Have cash for some of the vendors. Nikuman is everywhere to choose from. There are ATMs near. We would return.",
          "Yokohama's Chinatown is like so many Chinatowns around the world, with lots of restaurants and food shops. Gaudily decorated arches mark the entry points to the district. Thought I might find a museum in there somewhere telling the story of Chinese migration to Japan (and why a",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed visiting Yokohama\u2019s Chinatown. It\u2019s not just Chinese shops here but all Vietnamese and other areas are represented too. Great for buying souvenirs, especially the food and drink variety. Lots of great restaurants too.",
          "We walked to China Town again a very interesting part of town with good food and shops to visit lots to do",
          "China town in Yokohama looks like most china towns with endless stores with food and cheap goods. Only recommended for a walk through",
          "The Chinatown area is vibrant. It is also very clean and comfortable. Lots of good eating options and the obligatory souvenir shops !!",
          "Depending on the time and day, Yokohama Chinatown can be super busy and crowds everywhere. Lots of places to eat. Prices varies a lot, cheap to expensive. Close to other attractions such as Marine Tower and Yamashita Park. Close to cruise terminal about 15 minutes walk. Very",
          "It is a must see place in Yokohama! The China town is huge and fully packed by different restaurants and grocery or souvenir stores. There are also a few beautiful Chinese temples around.",
          "Lots of food places, some with huge queues so you know they're good. I got an amazing pork & veg Bao from the store near the little pagoda/park area",
          "Just half an hour from Tokyo, Yokohama offers you one of the most beautiful sea front and Chinatowns of the world. The colourful Chinatown is packed with restaurants and shops plus a gorgeous temple. I had some fried soja noodles and a beer for 1.500 yens that kept goofing",
          "I've been to the one in Chicago, San Diego, New York, Hawaii, Singapore, Australia and the one in Japan is abit better. More food places. Dumplings galore and many snacks. Went to one of them fish pedicure things, that was fun. In all just fun to experience it in Japan. Nothing",
          "Pretty large Chinatown. We have been to many around the world. Visited on a Sunday, super crowded! Lot of dim sum places to dine at. You can walk from the cruise port.",
          "It's a good sized, typical Chinatown, with so much more in quirky shops, massage parlors, spiritual palm readers everywhere, it was fun. Sadly most of the food we tried was less tasty than hoped for, bladder and dressier than expected. I'd just enjoy the vibe and wait to enjoy",
          "Many streets of shops and restaurants to please everyone. There are a couple of temples that you can pay to enter. One was being restored and not open. A few people were dressed in \"traditional\" dresses, very nice to see.",
          "There are so many delicious Chinese restaurants in Chinatown! So many small alleys and shops to explore.",
          "We've been in Japan for three weeks and Yokohama Chinatown is the first time we've been disappointed with somewhere. It's just a tourist rip off, worst food at ridiculous prices. If you visit we recommend you just walk around and take in the sites, sounds and smells and then",
          "One of the largest in Japan. So it\u2019s worth at least to walk the streets. Also you can get real food from china",
          "This is a rather large Chinatown in the busy port city of Yokohama. This our second visit and we arrived by cruise ship both times. Chinatown is only a 15-minute walk from the cruise ship dock and is well worth your time!",
          "We had a great time here, so many restaurants and things to see. It was wonderful. So much better and bigger than Nina Town in London.",
          "The Chinatown was one of the largest that we\u2019ve come across. However, in terms of offerings, it seems to be repetitive. Nikuman (or bao), Siew mai, and fortune telling dominates the scene. There are a lot of Chinese restaurants around which is a pity because you can only eat at",
          "Go to the Kobe Chinatown! This Yokohama one is a must-Skip!! Worst Chinese food I have ever put in my mouth. We ordered this roasted duck, since it's a famous Chinese dish, but it was the worst roasted duck ever. The moment you put it in your mouth you can tell it has been",
          "The place is nice and so interesting but don\u2019t be fooled by the cheapest food they are offering like less than \u00a51000 set menu but rather choose set menu that are a little expensive like \u00a52500 and higher. It worth your money.",
          "Having travelled quiet extensively I have seen many Chinatowns and frankly they are all the same (not surprisingly) Whilst always very colorful it\u2019s basically a string of cheap end restaurants. Nothing special here.",
          "My motto in Japan is \u2018if you see a queue, get on it\u2019 and this did not fail us for the soup dumplings! Yum! Chinatown is an assault on your senses - absolutely throbbing with people, amazing food everywhere you turn and the smell of all that amazing food just means you don\u2019t",
          "I had long wanted to revisit Chinatown because of fond memories from the 1980s. It was unrecognizable. Earlier, there had been neighborhoods, and a feeling of authenticity, whereas now it seemed mostly a tourist trap, with mediocre food and chaotic signs and souvenirs - somehow",
          "Really nice large Chinatown. Lots of nice gates and Chinese style buildings. Very clean and pedestrian friendly. Good food and atmosphere.",
          "At Motomachi-Chukagai station(Minatomiral line), walk towards Exit 2 \u51fa\u53e3. On street level, look for Chinatown80 and pick up map of Chinatown brochure. Look for blue icon that denotes 'food'. Check out these street food in Chinatown a)Tung Fat Egg tart \u00a5180 b)Endosei \u00a5500 pork",
          "Fun to wander around, mostly all food shops and stands. There are several little stores but even wih the sale price (they all seem to have a sale) most everything was way over priced!. Just go hungry and walk around and eat!",
          "The cleanest Chinatown I\u2019ve ever been to. The people are also the most polite. Many yum cha places to try, so your dim sum craze will be satisfied.",
          "huge that expected with a lot of all-you-can-eat restaurant, however, those was not special but worth to try if you were there. No need to select those with too many choice of dishes as you wont be able to try all in one go !",
          "I haven\u2019t been in the area for close to 10 years and it has changed. When I was there close to 10 years ago, stores seemed to be repetitive and buildings were rubbed down. They really cleaned up the area and prices are pretty decent.",
          "Maybe we missed the mark on what Yokohama Chinatown has to offer but it was unexciting and somewhat dull. Perhaps we were there too early, perhaps it was simply a quiet day, unfortunately sad to say, been to better Chinatowns elsewhere. But nonetheless, good to look at, lots of",
          "Don\u2019t go for the all you can eat deals. The food is mediocre and not worth it. Spend some money and go to a decent restaurant in Tokyo. Temple charges money to enter. You have to purchase \u00a51,000 incense to be allowed to pray. Have never experienced this as a practising Buddhist",
          "We went twice here but first time with Chinese food buffet. Food was suck and bad quality. Better to pay a little bit more to get something more quality and delicious.",
          "Typical Chinatown lots of shops and places to eat. Easy to get around. Not a lot of signs in English. Silk garden is near heard it is interesting but did not visit.",
          "If you miss beloved Chinese food, this is the best place to enjoy some delicious eateries on the street and in one of the many restaurants around.",

          "If you have looked for good Chinese food and snacks, this is the perfect location for you. You will pay only 100 Yen for good snacks or drinks. If you have looked for lucky charm, here you can find one for you. Any hiding amazing things, you will find one for you here at China",
          "It's one of the biggest Chinatowns in the world and the place is filled with neon light at night. Hundreds of restaurants serving different types of Chinese food, it's difficult to pick one. There's also a few temples, souvenir stores, groceries and even fortune telling",

          "Also if you don't want to spend a lot of money then just go around and pick small Tenshin shops they are very good ones and enjoyable. Few cheap ones services are not Japanese standard but food are pretty acceptable and all right. If you just want to have fun around in China",

          "The gates into the Chinatown are really the highlight of this trip. They are well done and eye catching. The workmanship is excellent and the colors are great. This is really a \"food stop\" and not really for shopping--all the shops have the same \"feel\" and not much great",
          "Chinatown is almost the same everywhere, but in far away countries are a little different than here, where I think it is more authentic. Many food places and shops where you can buy anything you want. Good jewelry also!",
          "This is a very large area with almost totally food outlets plus the odd shop and a couple of temples. I enjoyed my walk around the area but was disappointed that I couldn't find markets selling other products like I found in Shanghai. However, you would have to be very difficult",
          "Yokohama is a beautiful city only about 35 minutes from the centre of Tokyo, and no stay in this lovely city would be complete without a visit to Yokohama's Chinatown, probably the biggest Chinatown area in all of greater Tokyo if not Japan. It is a delight to walk the streets",

          "I\u2019d skip this if I had the chance. Overpriced food in a completely touristy environment. The only saving grace is it\u2019s close to a JR station (though NOT the Shinkansen Station), so it\u2019s easy to get to with a JR pass.",
          "Just like in other Chinatowns around the world, Yokohama Chinatown is nothing far unique from other countries, same foods, stuff, and no souvenirs to buy here. What I liked here is only the all you can eat Chinese restaurant.",

          "I have expected a chinatown to be cheaper, but neither the restaurants nor the shops are really cheap. It was a nice stroll through it though, if you are in Yokohama, reserve an hour or two for it, it's worth it.",
          "We checked this place out because I had a craving for some really good buns. And Chinatown did not disappoint, there were places selling buns and roasted chestnuts every few feet. There is nothing like fresh Anman (red bean buns), Nikuman (meat buns with mushrooms, etc.),",

          "Great place to walk around, especially at night when all lanterns are lighting the streets. Very busy on weekends and lot's of restaurants (more than shops!). Very touristy area with locals and Asian tourists in general. Definitively worth a stroll.",
          "Quite a typical Chinatown setting like in Manhattan or Chicago but maybe not so loud - here is more quaint and less hectic. Quite enjoyable to stroll and take some pictures. There were a couple of fortune telling shops if you are interested. We didn't try the food here but looks",
          "It is a good place to visit many many shops it is quiet big bit nothing as compared to the one in San Francisco . Lot of food stuff good place to spend a couple of hours even more if u can walk longer",

          "Not too far from the Martine Tower, Chinatown is easily found and a great shopping area if you just want to hang around Yokohama. From here you can catch a local train to Yokohama Eki and travel the entire country by rail. Would not hesitate to go back to Japan in a heartbeat.",

          "This is an interesting part of Yokohama with history and althogh not that large totally transforms the place into a somewhat tacky area that lokks like just about any Chinatown. There are the usual shops and retsuarants and a large temple.Worth a stroll thgrough.",

          "This apparently the largest china town outside of china! It has the full range of fortune tellers, restaurants, shops and temples. Varoius themed events throughout the year also. This is always a place i wonder when i visit yokohama.",
          "This was my first time at a Chinatown and I wasn't sure what to expect. You can enter from many different locations and you find a different gate at each. A change of scenery from normal Japanese shops and restaurants, different colors and people. There are a lot of restaurants",
          "Streets lined with restaurants all pretty much serving the same things for inflated prices: Dumplings steamed or fried, typical Chinese food like stir fry chicken and cashews, pork anything : buns, fried rice, ribs etc.etc. Horrible repetitive junky souvenir shops and a few",
          "Walked through china town and it was really nice. Tried a pork filled steam bun which was more bun than pork but was still good. Did not spend much time really looking through all of the area but what we did see it was nice.",

          "What I remember most about this place are the enormous gates which provide you access from all sides into this China town. I have never seen so many shops for fortune tellers! People have their store fronts set up and will tell you your future even in English! It's just fun",
          "This Chinatown is very big and a popular destination tourist spot. It's a great place to eat and take pictures at night. This Chinatown is very clean compared to other Chinatown in other asian countries. I recommend to come visit here just to explore the area.",

          "This should be the largest China town in Asia. There were plenty of restaurants and eating houses apart from the many souvenir shops in the area. The street shops would look more lively when illuminations were on. The street was clean and tidy and worth to have a stroll there",
          "Nice neighborhood, plenty of places to eat and shop. If you are coming to Yokohama, one place to visit is the \"Fish Doctor\". Aquariums with tiny little fishes will give you a foot massage that you will gladly remember. Nice place to walk with family and kids.",
          "There is pletiful food available from walk-up quick food to take out from inside grocery/gift stores, to sit-down cafes and restaurants. Oh yes, good bakeries too. Food can seem expensive in Japan, so the cheap eats places were welcome. There are two or three temples in",
          "This Chinatown is biggest Chinatown in Asia. The feel is same as any other Chinatown. If you are in Yokohama good idea to visit.",
          "The restaurants there are all similar, either Bau or eat all as you can. I didn't taste any but Bau is still recommend for tasting for travelers. The atmosphere at night is great, good for walking around. For eat all as you can, I don't think it is worth to try.",

          "This is rather large so be prepared to spend some time and do a fair bit of walking. There are plenty of places to eat and loads of shopping. I think it's best in the evening when all the signs and lights are on. The Minatomirai subway line will get you right here. Note the",
          "It was a pleasant surprise waling at Chinatown in Yokohama. Apparently it's one of the biggest Chinatown's in Japan. There was lots of food on offer, mega sized pork buns, all you can eat restaurants and desserts. Tucked away on one of the lanes is an old bottle shop where you",
          "We found it hard to find because we walked but found later there was a station nearby. Lots of street markets and stalls. A great place to buy cheap eats. Loved wandering around looking at all the stalls which are common in any Chinatown.",
          "We've been to many Chinatowns in the world, and this is one of the better ones. First of all, it's surprisingly large, clean, and well-lit at night. There are lots of restaurants and places to eat. But portions are small, and it's not cheap to eat here. For best food, try",
          "Spent an afternoon exploring the many shops and eateries here. It's a little larger than I expected. I didn't realize how many Chinese immigrated to this area. You can get authentic food, unlike the ones you find in the USA where they make everything for the American palate.",
          "This is arguably the largest Chinatown in Asia outside China. The four entrances are glamorously built with different meanings. Interestingly is the variety of food from different parts of China in such as a small area, ranging from Beijing, Sichuan, Cantonese, Shanghai,",
          "Gives a good insight into a slightly different kind of Asian culture. Good Chinese food as well as a nice spot to acquire some omiyage.",
          "It is Japan\u2019s largest Chinatown and you might need a compass to find your way. Apart from food, there are two 2 temples, Kanteibyo and Masobyo you may want to visit. An interesting spot you should not miss is the senshutei (public toilet) of Chinese architecture (of course).",
          "If you like snacking, and Chinese snacks in particular, this street is for you. With that said there's an abundance of 2500 yen buffets you can choose fromif you're extra hungry. Otherwise just roaming around the streets trying anything you fancy is good too, you'll get juicy",
          "A must see while your here in Japan. Lots and lits of food.All you can eat.Street food and all kinds of shops. Enjoy",
          "We arrived before most of Chinatown was open. Mostly they open around 10 am, on Saturday anyway. But we did find a great little restaurant open early. It was good to wander around anyway with few other people.",

          "Red paper lanterns, bustling people and many smells of fresh food being made as you walk through corridors of winding streets. There are stores to pop into and get trinkets or just people watch.",

          "Amazing area, dizzy and confused, magmatic and immersive..shops of any kind,oddities,smells and food, pandas and fortune tellers in the same area! An incredible melting pot that makes your curiosity boil! An unmissable mix of postmodernism and chinese elements as contradictory",
          "On weekends it is better to avoid Chinatown due to enormous crowds everywhere and long lines to all restaurants. Restaurants' employers are not welcoming to foreigners",

          "I visited Yokohama Chinatown with some friends during my recent business trip to Japan. To our disappointment, it didn't live up to our expectations as it's supposed to be the biggest Chinatown in Japan. There are a lot of Chinese restaurants selling Xiao Long Bao and",

          "A great wander after dark to see the local restaurants and life. Probably one of the cleanest Chinatown districts I have visited (well it is Japan after all). Good restaurant options plus classic Chinatown gate. Worth a wander if you are staying locally.",

          "If you have any other option, just go for that instead of wasting your time in chinatown. You'll only get rude behaving greedy merchants and a crowd. It is neither China nor Japan!",
          "Feast to the eye and stomach! Great vibrant place with lots of authentic food to choose from. Go to places where there is long line, they will not disappoint you! Only downside is most people don't speak English and most menus are not in English, hence, if you follow the line",

          "Great area to grab a few chuhi's from the conveni and have a walk around - try different kinds of food, and just take in the vibe. Its super busy and some times you have to line up for a while at the food stalls but its worth the wait.",

          "We always seek out Chinatown whenever we travel. The food is usually pretty good in Chinatown (minus DC Chinatown), and the price is usually reasonable. The setup was pretty good (not that big). Walkable alleys with restaurants and stands throughout. Had some steamed buns,",
          "We were pleasantly surprised at how larger Yokohama Chinatown is. There are lots of restaurants and a lot of shops that sells Chinese and Japanese snacks, & souvenirs. It is a place that typifies chinese towns - noisy, lots of people, colourful. There's also a chinese temple in",

          "Yokohama Chinatown is one of the biggest Chinatown in the world. There are loads of Chinese restaurants (Japanese style), places to eat - lunch and dinner and some souvenir shops. Other than that, there is really not much to do. Visit this place only if you have some extra time.",
          "As with most of Japan, our evening visit to Chinatown Yokohama presented us with a very clean & organised atmosphere. It was a very short taxi ride from Intercontinental Grand Yokohama, costing approximately \u00a51000. There was no shortage of dining & bar/entertainment options. We",

          "Between Chinatown eating and Motomachi shopping, this is must go. Lots of little restaurants so we don't have a favorite but you must try the roasted chestnuts and meat buns from the vendors open to the streets. Oh, and don't forget s pastry at Pompadour",
          "I have been to so many china towns that they all start looking the same, this being no exception. You find a ton of restaurants and small shops plus the streets were all packed with people. As usual, you manage to get a good bargain from the Chinese shops in in here :)",
          "There are many places to eat in Chinatown. New and old places. I prefer to go to the old places with lots of history particularly Peking Hanten which is located on the corner of the entrance of Chinatown. Their food is wonderful and there is usually someone who could speak",

          "We came on a very rainy day and couldnt really enjoy it.. We didnt find good shops, things were much cheaper in Tokyo. I dont think you should wait to get to Chinatown to buy presents. Asakusa, Shibuya and Harajaku offer a way better options. But is a nice place to visit, like",
          "Like much of Yokohama near the city center, Chinatown feels like it was built very recently and did not have the same awesome craziness and energy as Chinatowns in New York or San Francisco. We had a good meal. Would visit on next trip to Yokohama, however, the size does not",

          "Mostly restaurants that don't really cater for us Gaijins, not much in terms of other shopping, there are better ones around the world.",
          "We're spoilt with good Chinese food in Melbourne, so we shouldn't have gone to any chinatown in Japan. Big mistake. Worthed a picture and that's all.",
          "I reached this place walking from the Yokohama int. Port, I expected to see a different Chinese atmosphere, but it wasn't and it took my time and energy!",
          "Chinatown really needs no introduction as there are Chinatowns all over the world, but Yokohama's Chinatown is particularly special as it's not only a tourist magnet for locals and visitors alike, but also the largest Chinatown outside of China in the world. The place is",
          "Bustling streets with many shops geared for the tourists. Go to the next street over from the main China Town street, and you will see a grand temple. Even further over are the residents of China Town. It is like a maze. The aroma of food being prepared is overwhelming if you",
          "Colourfull, overflowing with restaurants, though language is going to be an issue in many of them. A handful of restaurants had English translations on their menus, but speaking to thewaiters was difficult in most cases. A very entertaining couple of hours, best seen after dark.",
          "Visited China town a couple of times - once during the day and also in the evening when it was lit up. None of us were very impressed by it as it seemed a bit shambolic, the hard sell to get you into restaurants was off putting too. Good to see but would not return",
          "As this was my first trip to Asia, I wanted to experience also China. This is possible in China town - many restaurants, many shops od different price levels from very cheap to very expensive. All the shops did close at 22 o\u00b4clock, the restaurants stay open but do not sell food",
          "I came once with a colleague for dinner and once daytime on my own. For dinner we had Beijing-duck at a rather touristy place and it tasted as if boiled so we only had the usual trimmings as a starter (expensive!!) and went elswhere for more food at a more pittoresque place,",
          "We were ready to eat Chinese food after 10 days of Japanese food and had dinner at two different restaurants. First was Peking restaurant which was very good but expensive. Second I can't recall the name but had ducks hanging in window. I really wanted Peking duck so we went",
          "It is good to use the Minato Mirai line. Whem you are inside china town there's a lot of panda shop and there is a lot of store that has afforadable things for souvenirs. Yokohama chinatown is the largest china town in Japan, never miss this attraction when you are in Yokohama.",
          "Lively and busy it's a short bus ride from yokohama minato mir\u00e1i. There is a beautiful temple and some nice Chinese restaurants some of them pricier than others. Nice for an afternoon stroll. Lots of souvenir shops as well",

          "No offence, but I do not understand the positive reviews. I'VE MET FOOD AND THIS IS NOT IT. My boyfriend and I are from China, and we have lived in and visited many countries. We've been to many chinatowns around the globe, and this is sincerely the worst by far. We took a walk",

          "My impression of Yokohama Chinatown is basically a collection of restaurants, far too many of whom were featuring shark fin soup. There was one temple we went by that was kind of interesting. If you're looking to find a place to eat and don't mind the fact that any set lunch",

          "The area is very clean Chinatown and nice to walk around and have a meal at one of the many restaurants.There are many shops to browse through.",
          "If you are in the area, it's worth the 10 minute walk, but otherwise it doesn't warrant a special trip unless you just happen to love Chinese food - food and grocers is all there is really. There are no special events, interesting novelty shops, or other attractions, but you can",
          "Just like any China town. Lots of small Chinese shops selling cheap stuff. Lots of restaurants. Nothing fantastic perhaps good for an evening dinner or lunch",

          "I don't necessarily like or dislike China Towns. I don't really see the need for them. This one looks ok but it's touristy stuff that seems overpriced at times. However the scenery is nice but it seems a bit shabby compared to the city outside of china town. Yokohama is a nice",
          "Yokohama Chinatown is the biggest Chinatown in Japan, and it is an important touristic attraction. In my opinion, it is however too commercial. It is rather for tourists than for Chinese residents in Yokohama.",
          "Even if you have experienced a Chinatown in another city before, the Yokohama Chinatown is still worth a visit. Great food, smells, lights, colours etc. Night time would be the best time to visit if you ask me. Easy to walk around, and plenty of shops to check out if that's your",
          "We went for a walk in the afternoon and my boys loved all the bustle. Mainly filled with restaurants and a few tourist shops. We had an ice cream and ice drink which was great and the talking robot made it interesting. Better at night for a meal than during the day.",
          "Great place to spend the afternoon walking around. You can do everything here. Drink, eat, shop, pick up souvenirs. It seems like there is always some kind of event or happening taking place. Sometimes it takes a little effort for gaijin to figure out what it is, but it's",
          "Was impressed with the visit. Variety of chinese food is available with distinctive food being the thick and juicy 6 pieces dumplings at 850 yen. The shop offer variety of snacks with cute packaging at reasonable price. Must visit place if you happen to be in yokohama",
          "We came here on a rainy day and this probably explained why the crowd was so few. We were not extremely impressed by the shops as we could see them in our country too. Nevertheless, the locals seemed to like it a lot. I guess its appeal was that it had gave you an exotic feeling",

          "Everything seems to be overpriced for what they are. I've been to a few restaurants around there, but didn't find them impressive. On the street, many places sell meat buns, but the price for one bun ranges from 350-500 yen. Wow. I think I can find something much better",
          "So many things to buy and see and taste and hear. We had an excellent sushi meal, an exquisite Chinese meal and a delicious cremia cone",

          "Accessed this bridge from Tsurumi instead of Yokohama for a different and surprisingly pleasant view. Take bus no.17 from JR Tsurumi station to reach the spot. From there bus no. 109 can be taken to Yokohama station which crosses the bridge while offering wonderful views of the",
          "Yokohama Bay Bridge is a modern design bridge crossing the entrance of Yokohama Bay with a container port on below. The bridge is used when taking the Limousine Bus to Haneda Airport and great views can be had of Yokohama and even Mount Fuji if the weather is clear. One can also",
          "The captain of our cruise ship said we would have a five foot clearance as we made our way under the Yokohama Bay Bridge on our recent visits there. As we went under, it looked closer than five feet, but I know he wouldn't take any chances. We did have to wait in port one time",
          "A huge bridge spanning the harbour. It looked just as spectacular from below as it did as it loomed up ahead and the ship just managed to clear it.",
          "We sailed under this several times as we left Osanbashi Pier and drove across it once. Its clean lines and delicate architecture belie its strength.",
          "Was not actually on it . But pass under it on the cruise ship we clear it by 3feet it was quite spectacular sight from the ship",
          "I was not actually on it, but saw it from one the many parks dotting the city. Makes for a pretty photo op, for sure, as it is a distinctive Yokohama landmark.",
          "This bridge you can see from anywhere around the port area. It carries two layers of transport and is quite spectacular if you sail underneath it. Other than that, worth a picture.",
          "This double decker bridge which spans Tokyo Bay is quite spectacular both during the day and when lit up at night. Great view up close when you sail under it.",

          "I was able to see this while riding the train.. It is an amazing work of art. Nice to take photos if you are on the cruise.",
          "Although it is called the Yokohama Bay Bridge it actually crosses Tokyo Bay. It was built in 1989 before the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo and is a two layered structure with a pedestrian walkway as well.It is quite impressive and of course a practical link between Yokohama and Tokyo",
          "This bridge is an amazing work of art structure which is earthquake proof. It is the way to reach Yokohama Bay from Narita airport.It is a great view and on a clear day,you can see Mt Fuji.",
          "Normally one could view the bridge from Yokohama coast or closer from the Cruise Terminal. We were lucky this time as our cruise Princess Diamond started our cruise trip and passing underneath the Yokohama Bay Bridge. The experience of passing underneath the bridge was really",
          "The bridge looks very modern, reminds me of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. Great views from the bridge.",
          "This bridge stands out and can be seen from many places in Yokohama. At night it is lit up quite well and stands out.",

          "If you're fortunate enough to cruise into Yokohama then you'll really enjoy going under the Bay bridge. For those that just want to view it from afar, then a good place for this would be Osanbashi Pier. Sunrise here is beautiful as it rises behind, and at night it's lit up well",
          "An architectural masterpiece on the sea in the Yokohama bay area. Best viewed either while taking a ride on the sea ferry or from the Passenger terminal deck. A great place for some photography and enjoying the sea breeze along the coast.",
          "What a beautiful bridge! And the view from the bridge is even better. A great view of Minotamirai and the area. It's worth a taxi ride over and back just for the view. The limousine bus to the airport offers a great view from up high.",
          "Travelled on this bridge while going to Narita Airport from my Hotel. You can get to see the view of the Yokohama Bay",
          "I did not have high expectations of a bridge looking ordinary from the pictures, but reality was even more disappointing. It's far from the port area you will likely visit, but probably there would be nothing to look at even from close distance. Just a bridge, anyway.",
          "Its like any normal bridge in any city- NY, SF etc. There isnt much to see. You can get a view of the bridge from Red Brick Warehouse. There is not much to see around. It can be avoided.",

          "We did a drive by of this bridge. It is lovely to see and has some great places to visit in area Lovely to visit at night time all light up.",
          "Not really much to see here or to impress me. There are some bridges that demand attention and praise, but this not one of them. You can find much better things to do with your time in Japan.",
          "Went across this bridge a couple of times once during the day and then again in the evening to take shots of different views of the bridge and yokohama during the day and night. Stunning views that you will treasure and never forget!",
          "We went on it a couple of times to and from Yokohama. Then we went under it a few times on the back to back cruises. I would say going under it was more interesting. Gorgeous looking bridge that's like a landmark for the area but it's not really a destination or a must see.",
          "Spectacular looking bridge located in Yokohama Bay. The Engineering is very Impressive and the views amazing.",

          "This a just a long bridge. There is nothing special about it now. Its nice at night if you cross it in a bus or taxi. There is no expectation of something great on the other side like you do when you cross a bridge of this size other cities like Istanbul for example. Don't go",
          "I'm impressed by the simply, elegant lines of the bridge. It is a beautiful way to get cars over the bay. Still, it is Just A Bridge. I am not sure why this would be considered a destination or attraction. You can see it from most of Yokohama, so there is no point in making a",
          "Its spans one of the main rivers and can be seen from most places in an around Sagarichu / Motomatchi, good views if you get River taxi or if you walk around Intercontinental hotel. Impressive but not worth making a special trip to see it.",
          "Unless you're a structural engineer, it's not really that fascinating. It is visible from plenty of spots all around the Bay, but it is not a striking as it was when it was first completed. The suspension design has been replicated liberally throughout the world.",
          "Very neat bridge to see across the water, looks incredibly neat at night. If you want an amazing view go to the top of the hill at Harbor View Park, you will not be disappointed.",
          "Situated behing Landmark Tower, this museum hosts exhibitions by Europeans or local Japanese artists. There are also permanent works including Picasso and Dali. Opened from 10 am until 6 pm. Closed on Thursdays. Adult visitors have to pay 500 yen but children go in free.",

          "Very interesting as the bridge was built to withstand the strong earthquake that are common in Yokohama.",
          "Nice view and place to move around for shopping, this place is full of restaurants, shops and malls with local and international brands",
          "It was fun view the bridge from the tower. Yokohama is on the water and it is so lovely there (it is also a shipping port and cruise ships go out here). The bridge is beautiful. A great work of engineering."

        "wiki": "Japan (Japanese: \u65e5\u672c, Nippon [\u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274] (listen) or Nihon [\u0272iho\ua71c\u0274] (listen)) is an island country of East Asia in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It borders the Sea of Japan to the west and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Japan is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and comprises an archipelago of 6,852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); its five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city; other major cities include Osaka and Nagoya.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 126.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is administratively divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally divided into eight regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nThe islands of Japan were inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period, though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d. Starting in the 12th century, however, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh\u014dgun), feudal lords (daimy\u014d), and a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted a foreign policy of isolation. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, leading to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji era, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-style constitution and pursued industrialization and modernization. Japan invaded China in 1937; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under an Allied occupation, during which it adopted a post-war constitution. It has since maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an elected legislature known as the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the G7. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains a modern military ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful. Following World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant economic growth ever since the Lost Decade, the country's economy is still the third-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. Japan is a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries and has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan also has the world's second-highest life expectancy, though it is currently experiencing a decline in population. Japan has one of the richest cultures in the world, and is renowned for its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, including its prominent animation and video game industries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji \u65e5\u672c and pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (\u502d) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.  Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored today for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", in reference to Japan's relatively eastern location. It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".The name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric to classical history ===\n\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J\u014dmon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh\u014dtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).The far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince \u014cama and his nephew Prince \u014ctomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih\u014d Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsury\u014d state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.The Nara period (710\u2013784) marked an emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.\n\n\n=== Feudal era ===\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the sh\u014dguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). However, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy\u014ds) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy\u014ds; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh\u014dgun by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy\u014ds, and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the sh\u014dgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935.The early 20th century saw a period of Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of Radical Nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, beginning World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. Throughout areas colonized by Japan, many abuses were committed against locals, notably those who were forced to become comfort women. The war cost Japan its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives, and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\". In the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became the new emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJapan comprises 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) northeast\u2013southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China and Philippine Seas. The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi). Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km (18,486 mi)). Because of its many far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries. Approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index. Japan has 108 active volcanoes, which are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. Japan was originally attached to the Eurasian continent; the subducting plates opened the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.  During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter. In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round. The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp\u014d Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 \u00b0C (41.2 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 \u00b0C (77.4 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 \u00b0C (106.0 \u00b0F), was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According to the Environment Ministry heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused several problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 37 Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.As of 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Prior to this incident, Japan's emissions had been on the decline, largely because their nuclear power plants created no emissions. Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation  to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. The official goals of the Japanese government are to reduce emissions in 2030 by 26% comparing to 2013 levels and 80% in 2050. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. He is defined in the Constitution as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people\". Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, 2019.\n\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet is currently dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955. The prime minister is the head of government and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. As the head of the Cabinet, the prime minister has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State. Following the LDP victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz\u014d Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the prime minister.Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature, and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 22 years. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan partially for that purpose.Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia: Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G20 Summit to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region.Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nJapan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.\nThe military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The Maritime Self-Defense Force is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. The Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.\n\n\n=== Domestic law enforcement ===\n\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency and supervised by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.Additionally, there is the Japan Coast Guard which guards territorial waters. The coast guard patrols the sea surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2017, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.As of 2017, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around three percent. Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2013. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.Japan's exports amounted to US$5,430 per capita in 2017. As of 2017, Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.4 percent), China (19 percent), South Korea (7.6 percent), Hong Kong (5.1 percent) and Thailand (4.2 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2017 were China (24.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), Australia (5.8 percent), South Korea (4.2 percent), and Saudi Arabia (4.1 percent). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country.Japan ranks 34th of 190 countries in the 2018 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like \"The Toyota Way\", and shareholder activism is rare. Japan also has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world.Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016.\n\n\n=== Agriculture and fishery ===\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometers (14,000,000 acres) cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan ranked seventh and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. Some major Japanese industrial companies include Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel. The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world.Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.  Despite facing competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong through an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.\n\n\n=== Services and tourism ===\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, \u00c6ON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines listed as some of the largest in the world. Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The six major keiretsus are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015 and increased by 21.8% to attract 24.03 million international tourists in 2016. In 2008, the Japanese government set up Japan Tourism Agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020. In 2016, having met the 20 million target, the government revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030. For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015. Japan is one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis, and it was by far the least visited country in the G7 until 2014.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, which relative to gross domestic product is the third highest budget in the world. The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine and three Fields medalists.Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% of the world's industrial robots as of 2013. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 per 10,000 employees.The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. Japan became a major exporter of video games during the golden age of arcade video games, an era that began with the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and ended around the mid-1980s. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s, and Japan dominated the industry until Microsoft's Xbox consoles began challenging Sony and Nintendo in the 2000s. As of 2009, $6 billion of Japan's $20 billion gaming market is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Japan is now the world's largest market for mobile games; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nJapan's road spending has been extensive. Its 1.2 million kilometers (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation. As of 2012, Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometers (755,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometers (635,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometers (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometers (5,000 miles) of national expressways. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (Hokkaido has a separate network). Cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality. A new Maglev line called the Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen is being constructed between Tokyo and Nagoya. It is due to be completed in 2027.There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport. Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nAs of 2017, 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nThe government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities. Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million, of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019). Honsh\u016b is the world's second most populous island and has 80% of Japan's population. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).Japanese society is linguistically, ethnically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.1% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers. The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent, and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan. In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians, the largest community of Westerners.Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010\u20132015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050. On September 15, 2018, for the first time, one in five Japanese residents was aged 70 or older. 26.18 million people are 70 or older and accounted for 20.7 percent of the population. Elderly women crossed the 20 million line at 20.12 million, substantially outnumbering the nation's 15.45 million elderly men. The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050.Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new naturalized citizens per year. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nJapan has full religious freedom based on its constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d). However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual, despite participating in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition. As a result, religious statistics are often under-reported in Japan. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians, most of them living in the western part of the country.  As of 2007, there were 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.Islam in Japan is estimated to constitute about 80\u201390% of foreign-born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Many of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith; since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nMore than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery after World War II when the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the standard school system. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 4.1 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 5.0 percent. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth.  In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent. In addition, 60.4 percent Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Japan has a high suicide rate; suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30. Another significant public health issue is smoking. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.\n\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n\nJapanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz\u014d Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.During the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were the first \"modern\" novelists of Japan, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors \u2013 Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers. Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar\u014d Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan.The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku. Noh and ky\u014dgen theater traditions are among the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.\n\n\n=== Customs and holidays ===\n\nIshin-denshin (\u4ee5\u5fc3\u4f1d\u5fc3) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. Isagiyosa (\u6f54\u3055) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world. Hansei (\u53cd\u7701) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (\u8a00\u970a) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names. There are many annual festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese matsuri (\u796d). There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H\u014dritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nJapanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staple of Japanese cuisine, typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Dishes inspired by foreign food\u2014in particular Chinese food\u2014like ramen and gy\u014dza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nTelevision and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. Over the 1990s, television surpassed newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium. There are six nationwide television networks: NHK (public broadcasting), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi (EX) and TV Tokyo Network (TXN). Television networks were mostly established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television shows. According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.Japanese readers have a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers, with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspapers are the Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in 1999, 85.4 percent of men and 75 percent of women read a newspaper every day.Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; movies have been produced in Japan since 1897. Ishir\u014d Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times, more than any other Asian country. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced. Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.Japan has significant involvement in motorsport. Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan also have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series. The country also hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix, Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka 10 Hours, 6 Hours of Fuji, FIA WTCC Race of Japan and the Indy Japan 300.\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. Further, the country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record six times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan also hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Japan-related articles\nOutline of Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Government\n\nJapanGov \u2013 The Government of Japan (in English)\nPrime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet Official website (in English)\nThe Imperial Household Agency, official site of the Imperial House of Japan\nNational Diet Library General information\n\nJapan from UCB Libraries GovPubs\nJapan Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica entry\nJapan profile from BBC News\nJapan from the OECD\n Geographic data related to Japan at OpenStreetMap",

          "If this structure isn't in an architectural coffee table book, it ought to be. It's as if elements of ship architecture were borrowed to create a non-traditional wood building that serves as a public park and international cruise ship terminal jutting into the Yokohama harbor.",

          "We travel by train from Shinjukusanchome to Nichon-odori station. It's only a 5 minute walk to the terminal. We managed with luggage. We were boarding the diamond princess cruise ship.",
          "It is a must do to visit Yokohama Port Osanbashi International Passenger Terminal. You will have a great view of Tokyo bay as well as an observation of unusual design for this terminal.",
          "The whole harbour area is very interesting, beautiful and relaxing. The scenery is best appreciated at night around 7pm when the big wheel starts to change colour and pattern. Whilst there, we also saw an amazing street performer doing his tricks with many instruments and he was",
          "Embarked and finished cruise here. Unusual design like a whale. When we sailed out of post hundreds of locals came to see us off in a carnival atmosphere. Great send off",
          "The night time view is spectacular, on a clear night get a good view of Mount Fuji also. On the pier there is a shop to get beer and food.",
          "I prefer this place in evening, it gets cooler and view is perfect on a sunset and evening highlights. I wish I could lay on a grass there.",
          "The terminal is build like a ship, when you walk inside, you really feel it. There are not many shops inside, and there is only one restaurant. The good view of the Minato-Mirai 21 area as seen in sample photo. The night scene is more attractive than the day.",
          "It is a nicely appointed and well set out cruise ship terminal with public observation decks on top. It is in easy walking distance from Nihon-Odori Station which connects to Yokohama Station. There is public transport access including taxis and large areas to handle all the",
          "This architecture is impressive. Large deck you can relax walking and see the whole bay of Yokohama. Nice place if you love bay life. but not recommend in raining season.",

          "I loved this passenger terminal. Hundreds of people flowed quickly through this area to board the cruise ship. The nautical theme is evident with wooden walking decks gently undulating and guard rails curved to match the waves of the sea. It is only 2 stories high so that the",
          "The night view is really pretty! You can see the building from the bridge! I haven't get nearer to the building but I will if I go to Japan again!",
          "This is one of the nicest and most efficient cruise ship terminals that I have been in. To be fair we had already passed through customs and immigration in Nagasaki, so this was just a \"walk-through\". There is easy access to transportation without having to go outside if it",
          "Interesting landmark on its own, innovative design, easy walk to closeby rail links and shuttles usually provided from Terminal to local rail station or airports direct. Taxi transfers to local Rail stations & hotels inexpensive.",
          "Time in this port can be very enjoyable for the independent traveller Walk off the ship and enjoy the many interesting small shops on the safe and pleasant area adjacent to the cruise ship berth. A few blocks away ,going on foot there is a wonderful ,peaceful garden to explore",
          "I really enjoyed arriving and leaving from the Osanbashi terminal. It's a great cruise terminal and well organised. As for wanting to see cruise ships when in port, this place would be one of the best in the world. You can get very close and the viewing area is designed really",
          "You can get on of the terminal as they have a really great wooden terrace and enjoy the skyline of Yokohama and Tokyo. If it is a hot summer day try to avoid this though.",
          "Climb on the wooden deck. Sit and enjoy one of the most amazing scenes in Japan. Beautiful all year round and all day long, but the magic truly hits at night.",
          "Location - On the Yokohama Bay area. For people visiting this place from Tokyo, get down at the Kannai station on the JR line of Keihin-Tohoku. The Passenger terminal is accessible for free and offers a splendid view of the Yokohama bay area along with the view of the city",
          "Very overated attraction. It is a great pier with grassy knolls on top for taking in the port scenery and a long boardwalk and pleasant stroll. Thats about it. The best thing to do is to take a look on board the Yokohama Maru, a 4 mast barque sailing ship built in 1930 as a",
          "At the night will see the light from around the bay there very impressive place for lover and family. If come alone may feel lonely lil'bit",
          "Osanbashi has many restaurants and bars that offers cheap to mid-high drinks like beers and cocktails. A good place for company events and with a very nice view of Minato Mirai which is shown on the picture. A nice place to jog at night or stroll with your pets",
          "There are two times for this cruise. We went on the earlier one at 5 pm and the cruise was for 90minutes. It is a cruise only or buffet Chinese dinner. We did the cruise only and could only sit outside.. IR was extremely windy that day so be careful what you choose as we were",
          "There is an array of things to do in Yokohama Port from enjoying the park area, to dining and shopping. There is also the fabulous small fairgrounds. Recommended.",
          "The audio was difficult to hear but we did manage a glimpse of Mt Fuji as directed. Use the computer in the cabin to locate sights.",
          "Prepare for a bracing walk if it is windy but it is a lovely stroll I would guess any time. Watch out for newly weds getting blown away having their photos taken!",
          "Osanbashi Pier is a place that I have made into a 'MUST-VISIT' for all my trips and especially when I'm in Yokohama / around Minato Mirai vicinity itself. Furthermore it is a great place to be at anytime of the day - be it morning or afternoon or evening to experience gorgeous",
          "We actually found this place out by accident taking the C Route tour bus originating from Sakuragicho Station. From the pier is a breathtaking view of the Minato Mirai 21 area. There's not much else to say. Worth the time it took to visit there and will definitely come back",
          "The pier is huge you get a great shot from the top take the camera the view around is fantastic heaps of ships tourist boats tugs police boats etc",
          "I visited this place with my Wife & duaghter in evening time, it was really a wonderful time there, Cool Breeze will welcome you, Alot of Vending machine & food joint to fullfill your need.",
          "I was here while there was a festival and you could taste food of may different countries. However even without any events the place is nice and relaxing, and the views are breathtaking! I recommend this place",
          "A friend and I walked down this pier and the undulation was wild. From the end there is a pretty good view of the city! It was a good free thing to do but I'm not sure it's worth it to go out of your way to see.",
          "Amazing place... it's not only works as international port, but also a tourist attraction. From on the top of it you can see an amazing view of Red Brick House, minato mirai 21, yamashita park, and Yokohama bridge. I think it would be a great place to visit during sunset or",
          "Good place to view the skyscrapers of MinatoMirai and ships.Boardwalk at this Pier may be the most beautiful among the world.Night cruise from here is also recommended.In September you have a chance to see the icebreaker \"Shirase\" which is the second biggest icebreaker in the",
          "This is an amazing structure , if you appreciate fine woodwork skills then you will like this attraction Nice harbour backdrop and makes for an interesting walk on the way to china town",
          "Yokohama is one of the most beautiful cities I have been to numerous times. And the port city is a popular destination and not far from Tokyo. But for those who want to experience Yokohama (and have good walking shoes on) and are near Minato Mirai 21, take the walk to",
          "Osanbashi Pier is a very cool, modern pier that offers an AMAZING view of the Yokohama sky line. From one side of the pier you can see notable structures such as the Landmark Tower, Cosmo Clock, and Red Brick Warehouse. This is a great place to take a break and take in how great",
          "I do not know a human being who is not in awe of big ships. This is a great place to get up close to humongous liners . The place does not have an entry and you can just walk up to hear a band play in the evening while admiring a larger than life liner.",
          "somewhere to spend an hour looking round inside and out... You can walk up on the top viewing level..",
          "The woodworking here is unbelievable. A very interesting place all around. It was a busy day when we were there, but there was plenty of room. Great views. Great design and craftsmanship.",
          "It was quite on the day we visited so i cannot speak about queues but the staff were excellent and enjoyed helping you....",
          "As you walk along the sea walk towards Yamashita park you have the option of walking out on Osanbashi Pier where all the cruise ships come in. It's an awesome site when there is a large cruise ship docked.",
          "Having taken a boat trip down the bay we walked to Osanbashi Pier which is an International passenger terminal, and we were fortunate to visit when a cruise liner the Pacific Venus Osaka was about to leave on a three week cruise to Auckland New Zealand. It was fantastic to watch",
          "i was slightly disappointed by the experience of this structure.. it is well done, the wood works and patterns are great. but as a user, i wasn't very impressed. perhaps it would be different on a weekend on sunny spring day..",
          "Beautiful pier, curvaceous wooden architecture that is also - in the main - highly functional as a cruise pier. The only complaint I would have is that getting close to the actual departure point in any sort of vehicle is a nightmare. Getting from downtown Yokohama to the drop",
          "Did my morning run along Yokohama Harbour and also run up to the pier. Nice place for a relax run and some solo time... And also nice waterfront view.",
          "The first time I saw this place from a distance I thought, \"what a piece of junk!\" but once I got out onto the pier itself, I could only drop my jaw at the stunning views of Yokohama port and even Mt. Fuji! Xmas season is nicely illuminated but too cold but there's a nice cafe",
          "Open area with a nice park and a great view of the yokohama bay bridge and the Asaku cruise ship. Great place for a picnic with many people walking their dogs. The place can get rather windy and chilly at night.",
          "I never thought a wharf could seem so architecturally cool! A great spot to go to at night. You can see the bridge lit up on one side and look back on the lights of city on the other side.",
          "Nice design international cruise terminal in Yokohama. Garden & park on top of the terminals. Lots of locals visiting during sunny day. Nearby park & shopping areas. A Gem in Yokohama as it's not JUST a cruise terminal.",

          "At night the pier offers a superb view of Yokohamas skyline. But in daylight you can really appreciate the smooth design of the pier itself. Worth a visit!",
          "Really beautiful pier with amazing views. It's cool to check it out during both the day and the night, to catch the different views of Yokohama. I recommend walking along the waterfront to get here, so that you can enjoy all the variety in the waterfront area.",
          "We didn't go up on this structure but since we had been walking along the water's edge the entire afternoon, we saw it from various angles. It's truly impressive. Hope to see it up close soon when we go on a cruise.",
          "It's very pleasant and nice place to walk and feel the breeze of Yokohama. You can see Mt. Fuji from the tip of the pier if you are lucky enough.",
          "We saw this from a distance and decided to go up to the top. It was amazing, such a good view and it was a beautiful. Definitely must go up here!",
          "The structure is a magnificent piece of architecture, beautifully designed, put together and maintained. It has a fantastic panoramic view of Yokohama city and the Bay Bridge. Young and old come here to hang out, relax, walk their dogs, take wedding photos and just enjoy the",
          "It's a unique place due to a roof built with lots of wooden plate in combination with soft slopes, on which people can walk. A view of Minato-Mirai 21 buildings form this place of sunset time is in particular beautiful. Good photo spot.",
          "One of the best designed piers in Asia (or possibly the world even). This is definitely a must-see attraction in Yokohama; for those with not much time to spare for all the major sights in Yokohama, this should be the first stop. This pier offers great panoramic views of the",
          "Interestingly designed pier. I arrived just in time for sunset and it looked beautiful. If the weather is good you can even see a bit of Mt Fuji between the buildings. A great place to sit, relax and do some people watching.",
          "The Osanbashi pier is smart structure. Multi-layered with several levels to view from. Especially at dawn the views at the city are spectacular. Space enough for everyone to watch the sunset over the city.",
          "This is a very impressive structure and on a hot day it is a nice place to sit, have a picnic, catch some sea breezes and watch the criuse ships leave.",
          "Hectic with embarkation. There is a big mess due to personnel that are ill suited for their tasks. After the cruise is much better. There is a delivery firm Segawa which will send your luggage to a hotel, but un less you are early before 9 AM you will not get it the same day,",
          "A great place to chill out on a warm afternoon. The view is great and you can watch the ships in the harbor. Some small vendors sell beer and basic food and there is also a very good restaurant, Sub Zero, below the pier, which also has a panoramic view of Yokohama.",
          "This is a really interestingly designed pier and a lovely place to walk on to see the view over the harbour and city. I was a bit disappointed with the inside of the pier though, I was thinking that it would have lots of shops and places to eat in it but there wasn't much at",
          "Creative and stunning design of Japanese architecture. It's worth to drop by and enjoy the breeze of wind and sea side of Yokohama port!",
          "Impressive build of a pier. I chose to relax and read a book in the sunshine for a few hours. Other than that, there isn't anything to do.",
          "One impressive terminal! We were there to board our cruise--Diamond Princess, then on turn-around day for our back-to-back cruise, and lastly on disembarkation. This huge building can be confusing when you first stepped in but we figured everything out after the first time.",
          "We embarked Diamond Princess cruise from this Big Wharf terminal 3 weeks ago. There were scores of volunteers waiting for passangers of the cruise helping with bringing suitcases as well as general information. The boarding was amazingly smooth and quick! My father needed a",
          "I'd see the pictures of this place on TA so I decided to see it for myself. Sounds kind of boring but you have to see it to believe it. It\u2019s hard to describe but it\u2019s an architectural piece on a large scale made with wood decking riding and falling in unusual protrusions. As",
          "My cruise started and ended here - a lovely amenity. I would have liked to walk on the grass roof but it was raining.",
          "It is definitely worth the walk, however, do not expect too much there. You just see the skyscrapers along the water, some piers and a nice floral garden nearby - a nice change after a day in a rather greay city of concrete and glass.",
          "Architectural students would fancy this. I spent almost 2 hours roaming around its vast premises admiring its simple but yet captivating design. While I was there a couple were having their pre-wedding shots taken by their photographer. The coastline overseen by this wharf is",
          "Lovely to walk around the pier looking at boats, reading the funny Japanese English signs in the fresh air. Good walkway with nice gardens.",
          "The Big Wharf is a must see (or better, must step there) if you happen to stop by Yokohama. An unconventional shape, build on wood, with the occasional newlywed couple stopping by to take memorable pictures. The view is breathtaking, both of the city side and of the Yokohama",
          "This is the international cruise ship dock. Some famous architect built it, and as docks go, it's pretty cool. Not at all worth a trip by itself, it's worth walking out on as part of a larger trip to the Minato-Mirai / Yamashita Koen area.",
          "It's a very interesting place - transforming passenger terminal to a futuristic architectural art work. I was quite impressed w/ creativity and beauty. Size of Osanbashi was huge and massive - yet could be a quite romantic place.",
          "We got a good laugh out of the sign at the bottom of the ramp up which noted not to go barefoot due to the prickles. Using the translation app we have on our phones, we determined they meant splinters! There is a lot of wood involved in the construction of this terminal/platform",
          "This facility is well worth a visit as part of a walk around the refurbished waterfront area of Yokohama. There were no cruise ships docked when we visited but we walked the wooden/grassed structure which reminded me of the overturned hull of a giant ship! Inside is a big",
          "This is a well designed cruise ship terminal and park. Our cruise ship docked there. This ship terminal is totally different than the other terminals. It incorporates grass and floor boards that look like a skate board park, a few souvenir shops and fee Wi-Fi inside the",
          "Great place to go walk and enjoy beautiful sights of yokohama!! Approach is nice and easy and it is quite huge!!",
          "This is well worth a trip, wander around and view all the large ships in port I think it is one off the biggest ports in the world. Not far from here is the up noodle museum and various other attractions. It was great!!!",
          "Great place to watch the world go by and people watch. You can see the boats criss crossing the bay and usually there will be a large cruise ship coming or going.",
          "Looks really great on photo but not much to do. No cafe, souvenir shop or museum. About 15 minute walk or 450 meters from Minatomirai Mirai where I stayed. Visit this together with Red Brick warehouse as they are just across each other.",
          "Our ship docked at this pier during our recent Asian cruise. The pier has a very modern & unique looking cruise terminal. There is free wifi in the terminal, along with shops & tourist information. Very friendly & courteous people at the information desk. The pier is in",
          "My favorite place in the city. Lots of open space with no oppressive power cables overhead. Watch the boats come and go and get a great panorama view of the city and bay. Great place when the weather is nice. Not much shade so on a sunny day, bring a hat! Very interesting",
          "Superb view, including Minatomirai and Mt. Fuji. Fine architecture. Visiting during sunset would be ideal.",
          "We walked from Chinatown, easy stroll and it was good to experience the area. There were drivers string in their trucks, some resting and some eating the lunch. All in the parking bays.",
          "We walked on the pier and found it very nice. I think you need to walk it to understand it, it somehow fits with the see/port context very well. Even if there were no ships to be watched around when we went, it was a nice experience.",
          "Nice park of the walk around Yokohama bay... Lucked out as the cruise ship Nippon Maru was tide up along one side and the Japanese Navy training ship Nippon Maru (Sailing Ship) on the other.",
          "Beautiful view especially during sunset timing. Might be hard to navigate from sakuragi station.. but basically just walk straight all the way towards the sea and you'll find your way. Many couples and photographers will be there but sufficient space for all.",
          "It was good to drop by this place to observe the unique design and capture some photos for memory. There are ample parking under the pier building.",
          "I loved the innovative style for a pier / boat dock with arrival / departure building. The effect of all the untreated wood is very different and some cool seating too.",
          "This is a great walk to do to, beware that if it is windy you will have a terrible time though. We decided to walk the pier after visiting the red brick shop. The way that the pier is shape is really neat, and it offers some pretty easy walking and offers great views of the bay",
          "I spent the entire day in Yokohama with friends and this was a very memorable experience. the Pier is wonderful and one of a kind; all wood plank and very long. An amazing date spot, whether you're in Yokohama or Tokyo (a short 30 min, 400 yen trip away). I didn't go inside the",
          "Great design of the terminal along with friendly staff to assist. There is ample signage around to get you to the nearest metro station if you wish to go to Tokyo which is a few minutes walk away and will take you about 21 stops to shibuya directly . At night is a wonderful area",
          "Looks almost like a futuristic ship itself. Great views all round and a very cool shipping passenger terminal.",
          "The pier is easy to get to by bus or taxi (although the taxi was more convenient with luggage). There is free WiFi on the pier. The location is good, within walking distance from the red brick warehouses, the train station, and a large drug store at the end of the pier, across",
          "We embarked on our first cruise from Yokohama and were very disappointed that it took 3 hours from the time we arrived to the time we walked on to the ship. Unfortunately the terminal just doesn't seem equipped to handle large numbers of passengers. The location is convenient,",
          "as I'm architect by profession visiting Osanbashi pier while we were in Yokohama was a must see/ must do thing for me... And it was really great experience! Truly great work of modern architecture... with some really new and ground breaking ideas and solutions... and seem to me",
          "Very interesting architecture, although totally dwarfed by our cruise ship. Several boutiques and souvenir shops within the terminal which were open quite late into the evening",
          "This is mainly built to handle the cruise ships that dock in Yokohama. And like all things Japanese does it with great efficiency, courtesy and friendliness. The building itself is almost a work of art that seems to flow. It offers numerous places for visitors to view the",
          "Osanbashi terminal has superb design and excellent location at harbour front. When I arrived by the taxi, some workers come to collect my luggages and sendit to the Diamond Princess Cruise immediately. I took only 10 Mins to finish my check in process. And then I go up to the",
          "The actual pier is not an attraction as it stands, but it does have value if you want to get away from life for a while. The stroll along the pier on a warm sunny day is peaceful and relaxing, with good views of the surrounding water frontage and has easy access to other parts",
          "As I am a retired carpenter, the decking on this pier is a work of art and also encompassed shops, restaurants and good parking - worth a visit even if not going on a cruise",
          "We boarded our Princess cruise from this pier and can confirm that it's probably the best cruise pier in the world, and we've been in most of the others.",
          "Boarded the Diamond Princess cruise from here. Epitome of Japanese efficiency and order. Very large embarkation hall. They were able to handle 3000 of us passenger with ease. Very quick check in and check out when we disembarked. Abundant taxis and buses available to Haneda or",
          "A beautiful and modern pier, offers nice views to the city. A good place if you have free time, but if you go to Minato Mirai area, you can miss it.",
          "Osanbashi is a famous place in so many Japanese dramas, movies and TV commercials. It is only thirty minutes from Tokyo and you will see a breathtaking view of the Yokohama landscape from Minato Mirai. If you love taking photos, this is a MUST, especially in a good day. The view",
          "Sailed from there on Diamond Princess August 2014 had a great cruise around Japan and Korsakov in Russia",
          "The pier and it's area are beautifully designed. The pier itself looks like giant ship or wave structure. Wood and white colours are simple, leaving room for multi-faceted construction. It gives overall impression of simplicity and filling in surrounding sea. Nice place for a",
          "This is probably one of my favorite places in Yokohama. I highly recommend going both during the day and at night for unbeatable views of the skyline. Osanbashi is a nice place to sit and reflect at the end of the day, so don't schedule anything for after your visit here if you",
          "Pleasant walk with good views of Yokohama Bay and attractive area to rest a while. The model of Yokohama Bay area inside the departure hall building was well done and interesting as were the models of different ships using the port over the years.",
          "Yokohama, the port city is very walkable and it's easy to get to from a direct Tokyo subway. WIth its port background and walkability its easy to visit all the sites as you cross bridge after bridge. One particular one that takes just that bit more time due to its size is",
          "Attractive building but chaotic, hot and hard to understand ! We were there to get on and off a cruise ship. The ramps were steep and the air conditioning did not seem to work.",
          "Go at sunset or at night to have an amazing view of the city. If you like architecture, you must go, is a very impressive structure which happen to also be a very beautiful place to walk . It is safe and quiet with small groups of friens and couples thst go there to contemplate",
          "We came for a conference party. The party was great, and what a venue! The pier is beautiful, with a lot of wood in its construction and also grass lawns. There are great views of the bay and also the big buildings of Minato Mirai. If you miss it after your visit, there is a",
          "A very convenient location to visit \u2013 minutes from Bashamichi street, the Yamashita Park and Nihon Odori sta. From a distance the whole place looks like a giant wavy-like ferry/structure. Yet it has the modern architectural-style and is actually a rather unusual pier - an",
          "For taking pics of Yokohama port, I stayed in Yokohama for 3 night & 1 day. I suggest that here is the best spot for taking pic of Yokohama port. You may see the completed skyline of Yokohama builds.",

          "This modern pier was designed by two architects based in UK. The complecate curve decks are covered with the wooden panels and set the grass gurdens in places. It is a 15-minute walk from Minato Mirai area or Kannai station. Sometimes an ocean liner moors on this pier. I heard",

          "This place looks like a giant ferry or something. Very modern and definitely a nice area to walk. From a far it looks so huge. I wish there were more places like this in Tokyo. I really like what Yokohama has to offer in terms of a modern city and it has become one of my",
          "Finally got chance to visit here.Not too far from the station,walk along the street then you can see it right before. The better way to enjoy is the night view from the brigde, can have the whole picture of the Minatomirai.Just take my time to have a nice talk with friends.",
          "It's worth visiting Osanbashi Pier to see the extensive timber decking, quite amazing really. You can walk out to the end and visit shops offering plenty of souvenirs for the tourist. It is a very large area giving you good views back to Yamashita Park and across Yokohama Bay.",
          "Quiet an impressive pier, with great views of the city and the bay. Also, plenty of places to sit, with seating to either watch a sunrise or sunset from the pier. Looked like an underground terminal, international terminal, I think it was called, but I didn't go in. Nice breeze",
          "If you feel like an energetic walk then a walk around the pier would suit you with good views all around and a wee cafe serving food and a cold beer to be enjoyed afterwards.",

        "wiki": "Japanese Americans (Japanese: \u65e5\u7cfb\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba, Hepburn: Nikkei Amerikajin) are Americans who are fully or partially of Japanese descent, especially those who identify with that ancestry and its cultural characteristics. Japanese Americans were among the three largest Asian American ethnic communities during the 20th century; but, according to the 2000 census, they have declined in number to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 773,000, including those of partial ancestry. According to the 2010 census, the largest Japanese American communities were found in California with 272,528, Hawaii with 185,502, New York with 37,780, Washington with 35,008, Illinois with 17,542, and Ohio with 16,995. Southern California has the largest Japanese American population in North America and the city of Gardena holds the densest Japanese American population in the 48 contiguous states.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\nPeople from Japan began migrating to the US in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the Meiji Restoration in 1868. These early Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka and most of them settled in either Hawaii or along the West Coast. The Japanese population in the United States grew from 148 in 1880 (mostly students) to 2,039 in 1890 and 24,326 by 1900.In 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement between the governments of Japan and the United States ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US. Prior to the Gentlemen's Agreement, about seven out of eight ethnic Japanese in the continental United States were men.  By 1924, the ratio had changed to approximately four women to every six men. Japanese immigration to the U.S. effectively ended when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 which banned all but a token few Japanese people. The earlier Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized United States citizenship to free white persons, which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws.  Due to these restrictions, Japanese immigration to the United States between 1931-1950 only totaled 3,503 which is strikingly low compared to the totals of 46,250 people in 1951\u20131960, 39,988 in 1961-70, 49,775 in 1971-80, 47,085 in 1981-90, and 67,942 in 1991-2000.Because no new immigrants from Japan were permitted after 1924, almost all pre-World War II Japanese Americans born after this time were born in the United States. This generation, the Nisei, became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the Sansei. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries.\nIn recent years, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the US from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration.\n\n\n=== Internment and redress ===\n\nDuring World War II, an estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals or citizens residing on the West Coast of the United States were forcibly interned in ten different camps across the Western United States. The internment was based on the race or ancestry, rather than the activities of the interned. Families, including children, were interned together.\nFour decades later, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 officially acknowledged the \"fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights\" of the internment. Many Japanese-Americans consider the term internment camp a euphemism and prefer to refer to the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans as imprisonment in concentration camps. Webster's New World Fourth College Edition defines a concentration camp: \"A prison camp in which political dissidents, members of minority ethnic groups, etc. are confined.\"\n\n\n== Cultural profile ==\n\n\n=== Generations ===\nThe nomenclature for each of their generations who are citizens or long-term residents of countries other than Japan, used by Japanese Americans and other nationals of Japanese descent are explained here; they are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (sei \u4e16). The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like Issei, Nisei, and Sansei, which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called Yonsei (\u56db\u4e16), and the fifth is called Gosei (\u4e94\u4e16). The term Nikkei (\u65e5\u7cfb) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.\n\nThe kanreki (\u9084\u66a6), a pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of Japanese American Nisei. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this traditional Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nIssei and many nisei speak Japanese in addition to English as a second language. In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese characters are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many nisei and sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nJapanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education. Math and reading scores on the SAT and ACT may often exceed the national averages. Japanese Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide Advanced Placement testing each year.A large majority of Japanese Americans obtain post-secondary degrees. Japanese Americans often face the \"model minority\" stereotype that they are dominant in math- and science-related fields in colleges and universities across the United States. In reality, however, there is an equal distribution of Japanese Americans between the arts and humanities and the sciences. Although their numbers have declined slightly in recent years, Japanese Americans are still a prominent presence in Ivy League schools, the top University of California campuses including UC Berkeley and UCLA, and other elite universities. The 2000 census reported that 40.8% of Japanese Americans held a college degree.\n\n\n==== Schools for Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals ====\n\nA Japanese school opened in Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for temporary settlers in North America followed. In the years prior to World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might go through the same discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.There are primary school-junior high school Japanese international schools within the United States. Some are classified as nihonjin gakk\u014d or Japanese international schools operated by Japanese associations, and some are classified as Shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu (\u79c1\u7acb\u5728\u5916\u6559\u80b2\u65bd\u8a2d) or overseas branches of Japanese private schools. They are: Seigakuin Atlanta International School, Chicago Futabakai Japanese School, Japanese School of Guam, Nishiyamato Academy of California near Los Angeles, Japanese School of New Jersey, and New York Japanese School. A boarding senior high school, Keio Academy of New York, is near New York City. It is a Shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu.There are also supplementary Japanese educational institutions (hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d) that hold Japanese classes on weekends. They are located in several US cities. The supplementary schools target Japanese nationals and second-generation Japanese Americans living in the United States. There are also Japanese heritage schools for third generation and beyond Japanese Americans. Rachel Endo of Hamline University, the author of \"Realities, Rewards, and Risks of Heritage-Language Education: Perspectives from Japanese Immigrant Parents in a Midwestern Community,\" wrote that the heritage schools \"generally emphasize learning about Japanese American historical experiences and Japanese culture in more loosely defined terms\".Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School (shiritsu zaigai ky\u014diku shisetsu) and International Bilingual School (unapproved by the Japanese Ministry of Education or MEXT) were full-time Japanese schools that were formerly in existence.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nJapanese Americans practice a wide range of religions, including Mahayana Buddhism (J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b, J\u014ddo-sh\u016b, Nichiren, Shingon, and Zen forms being most prominent) their majority faith, Shinto, and Christianity. In many ways, due to the longstanding nature of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japanese society, many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with Japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms.\n\nA large number of the Japanese American community continue to practice Buddhism in some form, and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around Buddhist institutions. For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual Obon Festival, which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as Southern California and Hawaii. A reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans.\nMany Japanese Americans also practice Christianity. Among mainline denominations the Presbyterians have long been active. The First Japanese Presbyterian Church of San Francisco opened in 1885. Los Angeles Holiness Church was founded by six Japanese men and women in 1921. There is also the Japanese Evangelical Missionary Society (JEMS) formed in the 1950s. It operates Asian American Christian Fellowships (AACF) programs on university campuses, especially in California. The Japanese language ministries are fondly known as \"Nichigo\" in Japanese American Christian communities. The newest trend includes Asian American members who do not have a Japanese heritage.\n\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nAn important annual festival for Japanese Americans is the Obon Festival, which happens in July or August of each year. Across the country, Japanese Americans gather on fair grounds, churches and large civic parking lots and commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food. Carnival booths are usually set up so Japanese American children have the opportunity to play together.\nJapanese American celebrations tend to be more sectarian in nature and focus on the community-sharing aspects.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nJapanese Americans have shown strong support for candidates in both political parties. Shortly prior to the 2004 US presidential election, Japanese Americans narrowly favored Democrat John Kerry by a 42% to 38% margin over Republican George W. Bush. In the 2008 US presidential election, the National Asian American Survey found that Japanese American favored Democrat Barack Obama by a 62% to 16% margin over Republican John McCain, while 22% were still undecided.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe distribution of the Y-chromosome among Japanese males is a lot different from the males of neighboring countries, such as in Taiwanese males. The Y chromosome is directly correlated to Asian populations, especially in Japanese Americans. The chromosome addition of Y Alu polymorphic element is only displayed in Japanese American men. People of Japanese descent show the highest frequency of the haplogroup O3a5. Haplogroups are groups of genetic populations that share a common ancestor, paternally or maternally. The frequency of this haplogroup is about 5% higher than its frequency in other Asian groups such as Koreans, Manchus, and other Northeast Asians. The Japanese DNA sequence consists of 24.2% Korean, 16.1% Okinawa, 4.8% Uniquely Japanese, 25.8% Chinese, 8.1% Ainu, and 21% Unidentified. The Ainu people were the key to the Japanese genetic origins because researchers found an exact DNA match with the Ainu and the J\u014dmon Japanese to conclude the Ainu rooted all the way back to the J\u014dmon. From mainland Japanese people, the MtDNA haplogroup frequencies are most occurring in the D4 haplogroup, with about 33%, with the second largest frequency in the B4 haplogroup, containing about 9%, and the third largest frequency in the M7a haplogroup, occurring at about 8%. The rest of the other haplogroup frequencies are much smaller than D4, with frequencies ranging from about 3-5%, consisting of mostly N9a, M8, and M9 haplogroups. Between the different Japanese populations, the Yayoi population has the highest haplogroup frequencies of the D4 haplogroup. The J\u014dmon Japanese group has the highest frequency of the N9b haplogroup. In modern Japanese Americans, the highest haplogroup frequency is in the D4 haplogroup, the same as the Yayoi Japanese population. In Okinawa Japanese populations, the highest frequency of haplogroups is the D haplogroup, with the M7a haplogroup frequency directly behind. Of the Ainu Japanese population, the highest haplogroup frequency occurs in the Y haplogroup, followed closely by an even distribution of frequency in the D, M7a, and G haplogroups. Lastly, for mainland Japanese populations, the D haplogroup presents the highest frequency. In Japanese Americans, the biggest components are Chinese, Korean, and Okinawan. People of Japanese descent show two pre-Yayoi ancestral Y chromosome lineages descended from Paleolithic people who had been isolated on the mainland of Japan. Studies of the mitochondrial component of Japanese American genes of haplogroup M12 shows a direct correlation of Japanese haplotypes with Tibetans. Other haplotypes that early descents of Japanese people were thought to be carried into include C-M8, which is another Y-chromosome haplotype. Also going back to the J\u014dmon, that gene is displayed in high frequencies in people of Japanese descent. The estimated percentage of this type of gene in Japanese Americans is about 34.7%. The highest frequencies occur in Okinawans and Hokkaidos. Overall, the genetic makeup of Japanese Americans show very mixed origins of genes, all due to the result of migrations of the Japanese ancestors in the past.\n\n\n=== Risk for inherited diseases ===\nStudies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to Japanese Americans, specifically in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer's disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based on a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60 mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding \"bad genes\" denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.\n\n\n== Japanese Americans by state ==\n\n\n=== California ===\n\nIn the early 1900s, Japanese Americans established fishing communities on Terminal Island and in San Diego. By 1923, there were two thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of Los Angeles Harbor. By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen. Still, areas like San Francisco's Japantown managed to thrive.\nDue to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, historically Japanese areas fell into disrepair or became adopted by other minority groups (in the case of Black and Latino populations in Little Tokyo). Boats owned by Japanese Americans were confiscated by the U.S. Navy. One of the vessels owned by a Japanese American, the Alert, built in 1930, became YP-264 in December 1941, and was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2014. When Japanese Americans returned from internment, many settled in neighborhoods where they set up their own community centers in order to feel accepted. Today, many have been renamed cultural centers and focus on the sharing of Japanese culture with local community members, especially in the sponsorship of Obon festivals.The city of Torrance in Greater Los Angeles has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies. Because of the abundance of Japanese restaurants and other cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A.

The Japanese Direct Investment Survey of the Consulate-General of Japan, Detroit stated that over 2,208 more Japanese residents were employed in the State of Michigan as of October 1, 2012, than had been in 2011.\n\n\n=== New Jersey ===\nAs of March 2011 about 2,500 Japanese Americans combined live in Edgewater and Fort Lee; this is the largest concentration of Japanese Americans in the state. The New Jersey Japanese School is located in Oakland. Paramus Catholic High School hosts a weekend Japanese school, and Englewood Cliffs has a Japanese school.  Other smaller Japanese American populations are also located in the remainder of Bergen County and other parts of the state. Mitsuwa Marketplace has a location in Edgewater that also houses a mini shopping complex.\n\n\n=== New York ===\n\n\n=== Virginia ===\nThere are about 5,500 Japanese Americans in Northern Virginia, representing the majority of Japanese Americans in the state and the multi-state Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.

Inouye to Congress. Spark Matsunaga was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1963, and in 1965, Patsy Mink became the first Asian American woman elected to the United States Congress. Inouye, Matsunaga, and Mink's success led to the gradual acceptance of Japanese American leadership on the national stage, culminating in the appointments of Eric Shinseki and Norman Y. Mineta, the first Japanese American military chief of staff and federal cabinet secretary, respectively.\nJapanese American members of the United States House of Representatives have included Daniel K.

        "wiki": "Japanese gardens (\u65e5\u672c\u5ead\u5712, nihon teien) are traditional gardens whose designs are accompanied by Japanese aesthetics and philosophical ideas, avoid artificial ornamentation, and highlight the natural landscape. Plants and worn, aged materials are generally used by Japanese garden designers to suggest an ancient and faraway natural landscape, and to express the fragility of existence as well as time's unstoppable advance.Ancient Japanese art inspired past garden designers. By the Edo period, the Japanese garden had its own distinct appearance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe idea of these unique gardens began during the Asuka period. Japanese merchants witnessed the gardens that were being built in China and brought many of the Chinese gardening techniques and styles back to Japan. Today, the tradition of Japanese garden art is still popular around the world, with many eastern and western practitioners expressing themselves through the medium.\n\nJapanese gardens first appeared on the island of Honshu, the large central island of Japan. Their aesthetic was influenced by the distinct characteristics of the Honshu landscape: rugged volcanic peaks, narrow valleys, mountain streams with waterfalls and cascades, lakes, and beaches of small stones. They were also influenced by the rich variety of flowers and different species of trees, particularly evergreen trees, on the islands, and by the four distinct seasons in Japan, including hot, wet summers and snowy winters.Japanese gardens have their roots in the Japanese religion of Shinto, with its story of the creation of eight perfect islands, and of the shinchi, the lakes of the gods. Prehistoric Shinto shrines to the kami, the gods and spirits, are found on beaches and in forests all over the island. Prehistoric shrines often took the form of unusual rocks or trees marked with cords of rice fiber (shimenawa) and surrounded with white stones or pebbles, a symbol of purity. The white gravel courtyard became a distinctive feature of Shinto shrines, Imperial Palaces, Buddhist temples, and Zen gardens.Japanese gardens were also strongly influenced by the Chinese philosophy of Daoism and Amida Buddhism, imported from China in or around 552. Daoist legends spoke of five mountainous islands inhabited by the Eight Immortals, who lived in perfect harmony with nature. Each Immortal flew from his mountain home on the back of a crane. The islands themselves were located on the back of an enormous sea turtle. In Japan, the five islands of the Chinese legend became one island, called Horai-zen, or Mount Horai. Replicas of this legendary mountain, the symbol of a perfect world, are a common feature of Japanese gardens, as are rocks representing turtles and cranes.\n\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nThe earliest recorded Japanese gardens were the pleasure gardens of the Japanese Emperors and nobles. They are mentioned in several brief passages of the Nihon Shoki, the first chronicle of Japanese history, published in 720. In the spring of the year 74, the chronicle recorded: \"The Emperor Keik\u014d put a few carp into a pond, and rejoiced to see them morning and evening\". The following year, \"The Emperor launched a double-hulled boat in the pond of Ijishi at Ihare, and went aboard with his imperial concubine, and they feasted sumptuously together\". And in 486, \"The Emperor Kenz\u014d went into the garden and feasted at the edge of a winding stream\".The Chinese garden had a very strong influence on early Japanese gardens. In or around 552, Buddhism was officially installed from China, via Korea, into Japan. Between 600 and 612, the Japanese Emperor sent four legations to the Court of the Chinese Sui Dynasty. Between 630 and 838, the Japanese court sent fifteen more legations to the court of the Tang Dynasty. These legations, with more than five hundred members each, included diplomats, scholars, students, Buddhist monks, and translators. They brought back Chinese writing, art objects, and detailed descriptions of Chinese gardens.\nIn 612, the Empress Suiko had a garden built with an artificial mountain, representing Shumi-Sen, or Mount Sumeru, reputed in Hindu and Buddhist legends to be located at the centre of the world. During the reign of the same Empress, one of her ministers, Soga no Umako, had a garden built at his palace featuring a lake with several small islands, representing the islands of the Eight Immortals famous in Chinese legends and Daoist philosophy. This Palace became the property of the Japanese Emperors, was named \"The Palace of the Isles\", and was mentioned several times in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the \"Collection of Countless Leaves\", the oldest known collection of Japanese poetry.\nIt appears from the small amount of literary and archaeological evidence available that the Japanese gardens of this time were modest versions of the Imperial gardens of the Tang Dynasty, with large lakes scattered with artificial islands and artificial mountains. Pond edges were constructed with heavy rocks as embankment. While these gardens had some Buddhist and Daoist symbolism, they were meant to be pleasure gardens, and places for festivals and celebrations.\n\n\n=== Nara period (710\u2013794) ===\n\nThe Nara Period is named after its capital city Nara. The first authentically Japanese gardens were built in this city at the end of the eighth century. Shorelines and stone settings were naturalistic, different from the heavier, earlier continental mode of constructing pond edges. Two such gardens have been found at excavations, both of which were used for poetry-writing festivities. One of these gardens, the East Palace garden at Heijo Palace, Nara, has been faithfully reconstructed using the same location and even the original garden features that had been excavated.\n\n\n=== Heian period (794\u20131185) ===\nIn 794, at the beginning of the Heian Period, the Japanese court moved its capital to Heian-ky\u014d (present-day Kyoto). During this period, there were three different kinds of gardens: palace gardens and the gardens of nobles in the capital, the gardens of villas at the edge of the city, and the gardens of temples.\nThe architecture of the palaces, residences and gardens in the Heian period followed Chinese practice. Houses and gardens were aligned on a north-south axis, with the residence to the north and the ceremonial buildings and main garden to the south, there were two long wings to the south, like the arms of an armchair, with the garden between them. The gardens featured one or more lakes connected by bridges and winding streams. The south garden of the imperial residences had a specially Japanese feature: a large empty area of white sand or gravel. The Emperor was the chief priest of Japan, and the white sand represented purity, and was a place where the gods could be invited to visit. The area was used for religious ceremonies and dances for the welcoming of the gods.The layout of the garden itself was strictly determined according to the principles of traditional Chinese geomancy, or Feng Shui. The first known book on the art of the Japanese garden, the Sakuteiki (Records of Garden Keeping), written in the 11th century, said:\n\nIt is a good omen to make the stream arrive from the east, to enter the garden, pass under the house, and then leave from the southeast. In this way, the water of the blue dragon will carry away all the bad spirits from the house toward the white tiger.\nThe Imperial gardens of the Heian period were water gardens, where visitors promenaded in elegant lacquered boats, listening to music, viewing the distant mountains, singing, reading poetry, painting, and admiring the scenery of the garden. The social life in the gardens was memorably described in the classic Japanese novel The Tale of Genji, written in about 1005 by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress. The traces of one such artificial lake, Osawa no ike, near the Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto, still can be seen. It was built by the Emperor Saga, who ruled from 809 to 823, and was said to be inspired by Dongting Lake in China.A scaled-down replica of the Kyoto Imperial Palace of 794, the Heian-jing\u016b, was built in Kyoto in 1895 to celebrate the 1100th birthday of the city. The south garden is famous for its cherry blossom in spring, and for azaleas in the early summer. The west garden is known for the irises in June, and the large east garden lake recalls the leisurely boating parties of the 8th century.  Near the end of the Heian period a new garden architecture style appeared, created by the followers of Pure Land Buddhism. These were called \"Paradise Gardens\", built to represent the legendary Paradise of the West, where the Amida Buddha ruled. These were built by noblemen who wanted to assert their power and independence from the Imperial household, which was growing weaker.\n\nThe best surviving example of a Paradise Garden is By\u014dd\u014d-in in Uji, near Kyoto. It was originally the villa of Fujiwara Michinaga (966\u20131028), who married his daughters to the sons of the Emperor. After his death, his son transformed the villa into a temple, and in 1053 built the Hall of Phoenix, which still stands.\nThe Hall is built in the traditional style of a Chinese Song Dynasty temple, on an island in the lake. It houses a gilded statue of the Amit\u0101bha Buddha, looking to the west. In the lake in front of the temple is a small island of white stones, representing Mount Horai, the home of the Eight Immortals of the Daoists, connected to the temple by a bridge, which symbolized the way to paradise. It was designed for mediation and contemplation, not as a pleasure garden. It was a lesson in Daoist and Buddhist philosophy created with landscape and architecture, and a prototype for future Japanese gardens.\n\nNotable existing or recreated Heian gardens include:\n\nDaikaku-ji\nBy\u014dd\u014d-in\nKyoto Imperial Palace\nJ\u014druri-ji\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kamakura and Muromachi periods (1185\u20131573) ===\n\nThe weakness of the Emperors and the rivalry of feudal warlords resulted in two civil wars (1156 and 1159), which destroyed most of Kyoto and its gardens. The capital moved to Kamakura, and then in 1336 back to the Muromachi quarter of Kyoto. The Emperors ruled in name only; real power was held by a military governor, the sh\u014dgun. During this period, the Government reopened relations with China, which had been broken off almost three hundred years earlier. Japanese monks went again to study in China, and Chinese monks came to Japan, fleeing the Mongol invasions. The monks brought with them a new form of Buddhism, called simply Zen, or \"meditation\". The first zen garden in Japan was built by a Chinese priest in 1251 in Kamakura. Japan enjoyed a renaissance in religion, in the arts, and particularly in gardens.Many famous temple gardens were built early in this period, including Kinkaku-ji, The Golden Pavilion, built in 1398, and Ginkaku-ji, The Silver Pavilion, built in 1482. In some ways they followed Zen principles of spontaneity, extreme simplicity and moderation, but in other ways they were traditional Chinese Song-Dynasty Temples; the upper floors of the Golden Pavilion were covered with gold leaf, and they were surrounded by traditional water gardens.\nThe most notable garden style invented in this period was the zen garden, or Japanese rock garden. One of the finest examples, and one of the best-known of all Japanese gardens is Ry\u014dan-ji in Kyoto. This garden is just 9 meters wide and 24 meters long. It is composed of white sand carefully raked to suggest water, and fifteen rocks carefully arranged, like small islands. It is meant to be seen from a seated position on the porch of the residence the abbot of the monastery. There have been many debates about what the rocks are supposed to represent, but, as garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote, \"The garden at Ry\u014dan-ji does not symbolize. It does not have the value of representing any natural beauty that can be found in the world, real or mythical. I consider it as an abstract composition of \"natural\" objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite mediation.\"Several of the famous zen gardens of Kyoto were the work of one man; Mus\u014d Soseki (1275\u20131351). He was a monk, a ninth-generation descendant of the Emperor Uda. He was also a formidable court politician, writer and organizer, who armed and financed ships to open trade with China, and founded an organization called the Five Mountains, made up of the most powerful Zen monasteries in Kyoto. He was responsible for the building of the zen gardens of Nanzen-ji; Saih\u014d-ji (The Moss Garden); and Tenry\u016b-ji.\nNotable gardens of the Kamakura and Muromachi Periods include:\n\nKinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion)\nGinkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion)\nNanzen-ji\nSaih\u014d-ji (The Moss Garden)\nTenry\u016b-ji\nDaisen-in\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Momoyama period (1568\u20131600) ===\n\nThe Momoyama period was short, just 32 years, and was largely occupied with the wars between the daimy\u014ds, the leaders of the feudal Japanese clans. The new centers of power and culture in Japan were the fortified castles of the daimy\u014ds, around which new cities and gardens appeared. The characteristic garden of the period featured one or more ponds or lakes next to the main residence, or shoin, not far from the castle. These gardens were meant to be seen from above, from the castle or residence. The daimy\u014ds had developed the skills of cutting and lifting large rocks to build their castles, and they had armies of soldiers to move them. The artificial lakes were surrounded by beaches of small stones and decorated with arrangements of boulders, with natural stone bridges and stepping stones. The gardens of this period combined elements of a promenade garden, meant to be seen from the winding garden paths, with elements of the zen garden, such as artificial mountains, meant to be contemplated from a distance.The most famous garden of this kind, built in 1592, is situated near the Tokushima castle on the island of Shikoku. Its notable features include a bridge 10.5 meters long made of two natural stones.\nAnother notable garden of the period still existing is Sanb\u014d-in, rebuilt by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598 to celebrate the festival of the cherry blossom and to recreate the splendor of an ancient garden. Three hundred garden-builders worked on the project, digging the lakes and installing seven hundred boulders in a space of 540 square meters. The garden was designed to be seen from the veranda of the main pavilion, or from the \"Hall of the Pure View\", located on a higher elevation in the garden.\nIn the east of the garden, on a peninsula, is an arrangement of stones designed to represent the mythical Mount Horai. A wooden bridge leads to an island representing a crane, and a stone bridge connects this island to another representing a tortoise, which is connected by an earth-covered bridge back to the peninsula. The garden also includes a waterfall at the foot of a wooded hill. One characteristic of the Momoyama period garden visible at Sanb\u014d-in is the close proximity of the buildings to the water.The Momoyama period also saw the development of the chanoyu (tea ceremony), the chashitsu (teahouse), and the roji (tea garden). Tea had been introduced to Japan from China by Buddhist monks, who used it as a stimulant to keep awake during long periods of meditation. The first great tea master, Sen no Riky\u016b (1522\u20131591), defined in the most minute detail the appearance and rules of the tea house and tea garden, following the principle of wabi (\u4f98\u3073) \"sober refinement and calm\".Following Sen no Riky\u016b's rules, the teahouse was supposed to suggest the cottage of a hermit-monk. It was a small and very plain wooden structure, often with a thatched roof, with just enough room inside for two tatami mats. The only decoration allowed inside a scroll with an inscription and a branch of a tree. It did not have a view of the garden.\nThe garden was also small, and constantly watered to be damp and green. It usually had a cherry tree or elm to bring color in the spring, but otherwise did not have bright flowers or exotic plants that would distract the attention of the visitor. A path led to the entrance of the teahouse. Along the path was waiting bench for guests and a privy, and a stone water-basin near the teahouse, where the guests rinsed their hands and mouths before entering the tea room through a small, square door called nijiri-guchi, or \"crawling-in entrance\", which requires bending low to pass through. Sen no Riky\u016b decreed that the garden should be left unswept for several hours before the ceremony, so that leaves would be scattered in a natural way on the path.Notable gardens of the period include:\n\nTokushima Castle garden on the island of Shikoku.\nTai-an tea house at My\u014dki-an Temple in Kyoto, built in 1582 by Sen no Riky\u016b.\nSanb\u014d-in at Daigo-ji, in Kyoto Prefecture (1598)\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Edo period (1615\u20131867) ===\n\nDuring the Edo period, power was won and consolidated by the Tokugawa clan, who became the Shoguns, and moved the capital to Edo, which became Tokyo. During this time, Japan, except for the port of Nagasaki, was virtually closed to foreigners, and Japanese were not allowed to travel to any country except China or the Netherlands. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead leader, with authority only over cultural and religious affairs. While the political center of Japan was now Tokyo, Kyoto remained the cultural capital, the center for religion and art. The Shoguns provided the Emperors with little power, but with generous subsidies for building gardens.The Edo period saw the widespread use of a new kind of Japanese architecture, called Sukiya-zukuri, which means literally \"building according to chosen taste\". The term first appeared at the end of the 16th century referring to isolated tea houses. It originally applied to the simple country houses of samurai warriors and Buddhist monks, but in the Edo period it was used in every kind of building, from houses to palaces.\nThe Sukiya style was used in the most famous garden of the period, the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. The buildings were built in a very simple, undecorated style, a prototype for future Japanese architecture. They opened up onto the garden, so that the garden seemed entirely part of the building. Whether the visitor was inside or outside of the building, he always had a feeling he was in the center of nature. The garden buildings were arranged so that were always seen from a diagonal, rather than straight on. This arrangement had the poetic name ganko, which meant literally \"a formation of wild geese in flight\".Most of the gardens of the Edo period were either promenade gardens or dry rock zen gardens, and they were usually much larger than earlier gardens. The promenade gardens of the period made extensive use of borrowing of scenery (\"shakkei\"). Vistas of distant mountains are integrated in the design of the garden; or, even better, building the garden on the side of a mountain and using the different elevations to attain views over landscapes outside the garden. Edo promenade gardens were often composed of a series of meisho, or \"famous views\", similar to postcards. These could be imitations of famous natural landscapes, like Mount Fuji, or scenes from Taoist or Buddhist legends, or landscapes illustrating verses of poetry. Unlike zen gardens, they were designed to portray nature as it appeared, not the internal rules of nature.\nShugakuin Imperial Villa\nShisen-d\u014d (1641)\nSuizen-ji\nHama Rikyu\nK\u014draku-en (Okayama)\nRitsurin Garden (Takamatsu)\nKoishikawa K\u014draku-en (Tokyo) (1629)\nNinna-ji, Kyoto\nEnman-in, Otsu\nSanzen-in, north of Kyoto\nSengan-en, Kagoshima (1658)\nChishaku-in, southeast of Kyoto\nJ\u014dju-in, in the temple of Kiyomizu, southeast of Kyoto (1688\u20131703)\nManshu-in, northeast of Kyoto (1656)\nNanzen-ji, east of Kyoto (1688\u20131703)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Meiji period (1868\u20131912) ===\nThe Meiji period saw the modernization of Japan, and the re-opening of Japan to the west. Many of the old private gardens had been abandoned and left to ruin. In 1871, a new law transformed many gardens from the earlier Edo period into public parks, preserving them. Garden designers, confronted with ideas from the West experimented with western styles, leading to such gardens as Kyu-Furukawa Gardens, or Shinjuku Gyoen. Others, more in the north of Japan kept to Edo period blueprint design. A third wave was the naturalistic style of gardens, invented by captains of industry and powerful politicians like Aritomo Yamagata. Many gardeners soon were designing and constructing gardens catering to this taste. One of the gardens well-known for his technical perfection in this style was Ogawa Jihei VII, also known as Ueji.Notable gardens of this period include:\n\nKyu-Furukawa Gardens\nKenroku-en, 18th and 19th centuries, finished in 1874.\nChinzan-so in Tokyo in 1877.\nMurin-an in Kyoto, finished 1898.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern Japanese gardens (1912 to present) ===\nDuring the Showa period (1926\u20131989), many traditional gardens were built by businessmen and politicians. After World War II, the principal builders of gardens were no longer private individuals, but banks, hotels, universities and government agencies. The Japanese garden became an extension of the landscape architecture with the building. New gardens were designed by landscape architects, and often used modern building materials such as concrete.\nSome modern Japanese gardens, such as T\u014dfuku-ji, designed by Mirei Shigemori, were inspired by classical models. Other modern gardens have taken a much more radical approach to the traditions. One example is Awaji Yumebutai, a garden on the island of Awaji, in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, designed by Tadao Ando. It was built as part of a resort and conference center on a steep slope, where land had been stripped away to make an island for an airport.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Garden elements ==\nThe ability to capture the essence of nature makes the Japanese gardens distinctive and appealing to observers. Traditional Japanese gardens are very different in style from occidental gardens. The contrast between western flower gardens and Japanese gardens is profound. \"Western gardens are typically optimised for visual appeal while Japanese gardens are modelled with spiritual and philosophical ideas in mind.\" Japanese gardens have always been conceived as a representation of a natural setting. The Japanese have always had a spiritual connection with their land and the spirits that are one with nature, which explains why they prefer to incorporate natural materials in their gardens. Traditional Japanese gardens can be categorized into three types: tsukiyama (hill gardens), karesansui (dry gardens) and chaniwa gardens (tea gardens). The main purpose of a Japanese garden is to attempt to be a space that captures the natural beauties of nature.\nThe small space given to create these gardens usually poses a challenge for the gardeners. Due to the absolute importance of the arrangement of natural rocks and trees, finding the right material becomes highly selective. The serenity of a Japanese landscape and the simple but deliberate structures of the Japanese gardens are what truly make the gardens unique. \"The two main principles incorporated in a Japanese garden are scaled reduction and symbolization.\"\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nJapanese gardens always have water, either a pond or stream, or, in the dry rock garden, represented by white sand. In Buddhist symbolism, water and stone are the yin and yang, two opposites that complement and complete each other. A traditional garden will usually have an irregular-shaped pond or, in larger gardens, two or more ponds connected by a channel or stream, and a cascade, a miniature version of Japan's famous mountain waterfalls.\nIn traditional gardens, the ponds and streams are carefully placed according to Buddhist geomancy, the art of putting things in the place most likely to attract good fortune. The rules for the placement of water were laid out in the first manual of Japanese gardens, the Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\"), in the 11th century. According to the Sakuteiki, the water should enter the garden from the east or southeast and flow toward the west because the east is the home of the Green Dragon (seiryu) an ancient Chinese divinity adapted in Japan, and the west is the home of the White Tiger, the divinity of the east. Water flowing from east to west will carry away evil, and the owner of the garden will be healthy and have a long life. According to the Sakuteiki, another favorable arrangement is for the water to flow from north, which represents water in Buddhist cosmology, to the south, which represents fire, which are opposites (yin and yang) and therefore will bring good luck.The Sakuteiki recommends several possible miniature landscapes using lakes and streams: the \"ocean style\", which features rocks that appear to have been eroded by waves, a sandy beach, and pine trees; the \"broad river style\", recreating the course of a large river, winding like a serpent; the \"marsh pond\" style, a large still pond with aquatic plants; the \"mountain torrent style\", with many rocks and cascades; and the \"rose letters\" style, an austere landscape with small, low plants, gentle relief and many scattered flat rocks.\nTraditional Japanese gardens have small islands in the lakes. In sacred temple gardens, there is usually an island which represents Mount Penglai or Mount H\u014drai, the traditional home of the Eight Immortals.\nThe Sakuteiki describes different kinds of artificial island which can be created in lakes, including the \"mountainous island\", made up of jagged vertical rocks mixed with pine trees, surrounded by a sandy beach; the \"rocky island\", composed of \"tormented\" rocks appearing to have been battered by sea waves, along with small, ancient pine trees with unusual shapes; the \"cloud island\", made of white sand in the rounded white forms of a cumulus cloud; and the \"misty island\", a low island of sand, without rocks or trees.\nA cascade or waterfall is an important element in Japanese gardens, a miniature version of the waterfalls of Japanese mountain streams. The Sakuteiki describes seven kinds of cascades. It notes that if possible a cascade should face toward the moon and should be designed to capture the moon's reflection in the water. It is also mentioned in Sakuteiki that cascades benefit from being located in such a manner that they are half-hidden in shadows.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Rocks and sand ===\nRock, sand and gravel are an essential feature of the Japanese garden. A vertical rock may represent Mount Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals, or Mount Sumeru of Buddhist teaching, or a carp jumping from the water. A flat rock might represent the earth. Sand or gravel can represent a beach, or a flowing river. Rocks and water also symbolize yin and yang (in and y\u014d in Japanese) in Buddhist philosophy; the hard rock and soft water complement each other, and water, though soft, can wear away rock.\nRough volcanic rocks (kasei-gan) are usually used to represent mountains or as stepping stones. Smooth and round sedimentary rocks (suisei-gan) are used around lakes or as stepping stones. Hard metamorphic rocks are usually placed by waterfalls or streams. Rocks are traditionally classified as tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat. Rocks should vary in size and color but from each other, but not have bright colors, which would lack subtlety. Rocks with strata or veins should have the veins all going in the same direction, and the rocks should all be firmly planted in the earth, giving an appearance of firmness and permanence. Rocks are arranged in careful compositions of two, three, five or seven rocks, with three being the most common. In a three-arrangement, a tallest rock usually represents heaven, the shortest rock is the earth, and the medium-sized rock is humanity, the bridge between heaven and earth. Sometimes one or more rocks, called suteishi (\"nameless\" or \"discarded\"), are placed in seemingly random locations in the garden, to suggest spontaneity, though their placement is carefully chosen.In ancient Japan, sand (suna) and gravel (jari) were used around Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Later it was used in the Japanese rock garden or Zen Buddhist gardens to represent water or clouds. White sand represented purity, but sand could also be gray, brown or bluish-black.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSelection and subsequent placement of rocks was and still is a central concept in creating an aesthetically pleasing garden by the Japanese. During the Heian period, the concept of placing stones as symbolic representations of islands \u2013 whether physically existent or nonexistent \u2013 began to take hold, and can be seen in the Japanese word shima, which is of \"particular importance ... because the word contained the meaning 'island'\"  Furthermore, the principle of kowan ni shitagau, or \"obeying (or following) the request of an object\", was, and still is, a guiding principle of Japanese rock design that suggests \"the arrangement of rocks be dictated by their innate characteristics\". The specific placement of stones in Japanese gardens to symbolically represent islands (and later to include mountains), is found to be an aesthetically pleasing property of traditional Japanese gardens.\nHere are some of the aesthetic principles, as stated by Thomas Heyd:\n\nStones, which constitute a fundamental part of Japanese gardens, are carefully selected for their weathering and are placed in such a way that they give viewers the sense that they \u2018naturally\u2019 belong where they are, and in combinations in which the viewers [sic] find them. As such, this form of gardening attempts to emblematically represent (or present) the processes and spaces found in wild nature, away from city and practical concerns of human lifeRock placement is a general \"aim to portray nature in its essential characteristics\" \u2013 the essential goal of all Japanese gardens. Furthermore,\n\nwhile the cult of stones is also central to Japanese gardening \u2026 as stones were part of an aesthetic design and had to be placed so that their positions appeared natural and their relationships harmonious. The concentration of the interest on such detail as the shape of a rock or the moss on a stone lantern led at times to an overemphatic picturesqueness and accumulation of minor features that, to Western eyes accustomed to a more general survey, may seem cluttered and restless.Such attention to detail can be seen at places such as Midori Falls in Kenroku-en Garden in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, as the rocks at the waterfall's base were changed at various times by six different daimy\u014ds.\nIn Heian-period Japanese gardens, built in the Chinese model, buildings occupied as much or more space than the garden. The garden was designed to be seen from the main building and its verandas, or from small pavilions built for that purpose. In later gardens, the buildings were less visible. Rustic teahouses were hidden in their own little gardens, and small benches and open pavilions along the garden paths provided places for rest and contemplation. In later garden architecture, walls of houses and teahouses could be opened to provide carefully framed views of the garden. The garden and the house became one.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Garden bridges ===\nBridges first appeared in the Japanese garden during the Heian period. At By\u014dd\u014d-in garden in Kyoto, a wooden bridge connects the Phoenix pavilion with a small island of stones, representing the Mount Penglai or Mount Horai, the island home of the Eight Immortals of Daoist teaching, The bridge symbolized the path to paradise and immortality.Bridges could be made of stone (ishibashi), or of wood, or made of logs with earth on top, covered with moss (dobashi); they could be either arched (soribashi) or flat (hirabashi). Sometimes if they were part of a temple garden, they were painted red, following the Chinese tradition, but for the most part they were unpainted.During the Edo period, when large promenade gardens became popular, streams and winding paths were constructed, with a series of bridges, usually in a rustic stone or wood style, to take visitors on a tour of the scenic views of the garden.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Stone lanterns and water basins ===\n\nJapanese stone lanterns (\u53f0\u706f\u7c60, dai-d\u014dr\u014d, \"platform lamp\") date back to the Nara period and the Heian period. Originally they were located only at Buddhist temples, where they lined the paths and approaches to the temple, but in the Heian period they began to be used at Shinto shrines as well. According to tradition, during the Momoyama period they were introduced to the tea garden by the first great tea masters, and in later gardens they were used purely for decoration.\nIn its complete and original form, a dai-doro, like the pagoda, represents the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. The piece touching the ground represents chi, the earth; the next section represents sui, or water; ka or fire, is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while f\u016b (air) and k\u016b (void or spirit) are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky. The segments express the idea that after death our physical bodies will go back to their original, elemental form.Stone water basins (tsukubai) were originally placed in gardens for visitors to wash their hands and mouth before the tea ceremony. The water is provided to the basin by a bamboo pipe, or kakei, and they usually have a wooden ladle for drinking the water. In tea gardens, the basin was placed low to the ground, so the drinker had to bend over to get water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Garden fences, gates, and devices ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Trees and flowers ===\n\nNothing in a Japanese garden is natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen according to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, to serve as a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their season of flowering. Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the lotus, sacred in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.\nThe trees are carefully trimmed to provide attractive scenes, and to prevent them from blocking other views of the garden. Their growth is also controlled, in a technique called niwaki, to give them more picturesque shapes, and to make them look more ancient. It has been suggested that the characteristic shape of pruned Japanese garden trees resemble trees found naturally in savannah landscapes. This resemblance has been used to motivate the so called Savannah hypothesis. Trees are sometimes constrained to bend, in order to provide shadows or better reflections in the water. Very old pine trees are often supported by wooden crutches, or their branches are held by cords, to keep them from breaking under the weight of snow. \nIn the late 16th century, a new art was developed in the Japanese garden; that of \u014dkarikomi (\u5927\u5208\u8fbc), the technique of trimming bushes into balls or rounded shapes which imitate waves. According to tradition this art was developed by Kobori Ensh\u016b (1579\u20131647), and it was most frequently practiced on azalea bushes. It was similar to the topiary gardens made in Europe at the same time, except that European topiary gardens tried to make trees look like geometric solid objects, while \u014dkarkikomi sought to make bushes look as if they were almost liquid, or in flowing natural shapes. It created an artistic play of light on the surface of the bush, and, according to garden historian Michel Baridon, \"it also brought into play the sense of 'touching things' which even today succeeds so well in Japanese design.\"The most common trees and plants found in Japanese gardens are the azalea (tsutsuji), the camellia (tsubaki), the oak (kashiwa), the elm (nire), the Japanese apricot (ume), cherry (sakura), maple (momiji), the willow (yanagi), the ginkgo (ich\u014d), the Japanese cypress (hinoki), the Japanese cedar (sugi), pine (matsu), and bamboo (take).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Fish ===\n\nThe use of fish, particularly nishiki-goi (colored carp), or goldfish as a decorative element in gardens was borrowed from the Chinese garden. Goldfish were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding Prussian carp for color mutations. By the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), yellow, orange, white and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Koi were developed from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Japan in the 1820s. Koi are domesticated common carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely. In addition to fish, turtles are kept in some gardens. Natural environments in the gardens offer habitats that attract wild animals; frogs and birds are notable as they contribute with a pleasant soundscape.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Aesthetic principles ==\nThe early Japanese gardens largely followed the Chinese model, but gradually Japanese gardens developed their own principles and aesthetics. These were spelled out by a series of landscape gardening manuals, beginning with Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\") in the Heian Period (794\u20131185). The principles of sacred gardens, such as the gardens of Zen Buddhist temples, were different from those of pleasure or promenade gardens; for example, Zen Buddhist gardens were designed to be seen, while seated, from a platform with a view of the whole garden, without entering it, while promenade gardens were meant to be seen by walking through the garden and stopping at a series of view points. However, they often contain common elements and used the same techniques. Some basic principles are:\nMiniaturization. The Japanese garden is a miniature and idealized view of nature. Rocks can represent mountains, and ponds can represent seas. The garden is sometimes made to appear larger by placing larger rocks and trees in the foreground, and smaller ones in the background.\nConcealment (miegakure, \"hide and reveal\"). The Zen Buddhist garden is meant to be seen all at once, but the promenade garden is meant to be seen one landscape at a time, like a scroll of painted landscapes unrolling. Features are hidden behind hills, trees groves or bamboo, walls or structures, to be discovered when the visitor follows the winding path.\nBorrowed scenery (shakkei). Smaller gardens are often designed to incorporate the view of features outside the garden, such as hills, trees or temples, as part of the view. This makes the garden seem larger than it really is.\nAsymmetry. Japanese gardens are not laid on straight axes, or with a single feature dominating the view. Buildings and garden features are usually placed to be seen from a diagonal, and are carefully composed into scenes that contrast right angles, such as buildings with natural features, and vertical features, such as rocks, bamboo or trees, with horizontal features, such as water.According to garden historians David and Michigo Young, at the heart of the Japanese garden is the principle that a garden is a work of art. \"Though inspired by nature, it is an interpretation rather than a copy; it should appear to be natural, but it is not wild.\"Landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto wrote that the Japanese generate \"the best of nature's handiwork in a limited space\".\n\n\n== Differences between Japanese and Chinese gardens ==\nJapanese gardens during the Heian period were modeled upon Chinese gardens, but by the Edo period there were distinct differences.\nArchitecture. Chinese gardens have buildings in the center of the garden, occupying a large part of the garden space. The buildings are placed next to or over the central body of water. The garden buildings are very elaborate, with much architectural decoration. In later Japanese gardens, the buildings are well apart from the body of water, and the buildings are simple, with very little ornament. The architecture in a Japanese garden is largely or partly concealed.\nViewpoint. Chinese gardens are designed to be seen from the inside, from the buildings, galleries and pavilions in the center of the garden.  Japanese gardens are designed to be seen from the outside, as in the Japanese rock garden or zen garden; or from a path winding through the garden.\nUse of rocks. In a Chinese garden, particularly in the Ming dynasty, rocks were selected for their extraordinary shapes or resemblance to animals or mountains, and used for dramatic effect. They were often the stars and centerpieces of the garden. In later Japanese gardens, rocks were smaller and placed in more natural arrangements. integrated into the garden.Marine landscapes. Chinese gardens were inspired by Chinese inland landscapes, particularly Chinese lakes and mountains, while Japanese gardens often use miniaturized scenery from the Japanese coast. Japanese gardens frequently include white sand or pebble beaches and rocks which seem to have been worn by the waves and tide, which rarely appear in Chinese gardens.\n\n\n== Garden styles ==\n\n\n=== Chisen-shoy\u016b-teien or pond garden ===\nThe chisen-shoy\u016b-teien (\"lake-spring-boat excursion garden\") was imported from China during the Heian period (794\u20131185). It is also called the shinden-zukuri style, after the architectural style of the main building. It featured a large, ornate residence with two long wings reaching south to a large lake and garden. Each wing ended in a pavilion from which guests could enjoy the views of the lake. Visitors made tours of the lake in small boats. These gardens had large lakes with small islands, where musicians played during festivals and ceremonies worshippers could look across the water at the Buddha. No original gardens of this period remain, but reconstructions can be seen at Heian-jing\u016b and Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\n\n=== The Paradise Garden ===\nThe Paradise Garden appeared in the late Heian period, created by nobles belonging to the Amida Buddhism sect. They were meant to symbolize Paradise or the Pure Land (J\u014ddo), where the Buddha sat on a platform contemplating a lotus pond. These gardens featured a lake island called Nakajima, where the Buddha hall was located, connected to the shore by an arching bridge. The most famous surviving example is the garden of the Phoenix Hall of By\u014dd\u014d-in Temple, built in 1053, in Uji, near Kyoto. Other examples are J\u014druri-ji temple in Kyoto, Enro-ji temple in Nara Prefecture, the Hokongoin in Kyoto, M\u014dts\u016b-ji Temple in Hiraizumi, and Shiramizu Amidado Garden in Iwaki City.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Karesansui dry rock gardens ===\nKaresansui gardens (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34) or Japanese rock gardens, became popular in Japan in the 14th century thanks to the work of a Buddhist monk, Mus\u014d Soseki (1275\u20131351) who built zen gardens at the five major monasteries in Kyoto. These gardens have white sand or raked gravel in place of water, carefully arranged rocks, and sometimes rocks and sand covered with moss. Their purpose is to facilitate meditation, and they are meant to be viewed while seated on the porch of the residence of the h\u014dj\u014d, the abbot of the monastery. The most famous example is Ry\u014dan-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Roji, or tea gardens ===\nThe tea garden was created during the Muromachi period (1333\u20131573) and Momoyama period (1573\u20131600) as a setting for the Japanese tea ceremony, or chanoyu. The style of garden takes its name from the roji, or path to the teahouse, which is supposed to inspire the visitor to meditation to prepare him for the ceremony. There is an outer garden, with a gate and covered arbor where guests wait for the invitation to enter. They then pass through a gate to the inner garden, where they wash their hands and rinse their mouth, as they would before entering a Shinto shrine, before going into the teahouse itself. The path is always kept moist and green, so it will look like a remote mountain path, and there are no bright flowers that might distract the visitor from his meditation. Early teahouses had no windows, but later teahouses have a wall which can be opened for a view of the garden.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kaiy\u016b-shiki-teien, or promenade gardens ===\nPromenade or stroll gardens (landscape gardens in the go-round style) appeared in Japan during the Edo period (1600\u20131854), at the villas of nobles or warlords. These gardens were designed to complement the houses in the new sukiya-zukuri style of architecture, which were modeled after the teahouse. These gardens were meant to be seen by following a path clockwise around the lake from one carefully composed scene to another. These gardens used two techniques to provide interest: borrowed scenery (\"shakkei\"), which took advantage of views of scenery outside the garden such as mountains or temples, incorporating them into the view so the garden looked larger than it really was, and miegakure, or \"hide-and-reveal\", which used winding paths, fences, bamboo and buildings to hide the scenery so the visitor would not see it until he was at the best view point.\nEdo period gardens also often feature recreations of famous scenery or scenes inspired by literature; Suizen-ji J\u014dju-en Garden in Kumamoto has a miniature version of Mount Fuji, and Katsura Villa in Kyoto has a miniature version of the Ama-no-hashidate sandbar in Miyazu Bay, near Kyoto. The Rikugi-en Garden in Tokyo creates small landscapes inspired by eighty-eight famous Japanese poems.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Small urban gardens ===\n\nSmall gardens were originally found in the interior courtyards (naka-niwa, \"inner garden\") of Heian period palaces, and were designed to give a glimpse of nature and some privacy to the residents of the rear side of the building. They were as small as one tsubo, or about 3.3 square meters, whence the name tsubo-niwa. During the Edo period, merchants began building small gardens in the space behind their shops, which faced the street, and their residences, located at the rear. These tiny gardens were meant to be seen, not entered, and usually had a stone lantern, a water basin, stepping stones and a few plants. Today, tsubo-niwa are found in many Japanese residences, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings. A good example from the Meiji period is found in the villa of Murin-an in Kyoto. Totekiko is a famous courtyard rock garden.\n\n\n=== Hermitage garden ===\n\nA hermitage garden is a small garden usually built by a samurai or government official who wanted to retire from public life and devote himself to study or meditation. It is attached to a rustic house, and approached by a winding path, which suggests it is deep in a forest. It may have a small pond, a Japanese rock garden, and the other features of traditional gardens, in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. An example is the Shisen-d\u014d garden in Kyoto, built by a bureaucrat and scholar exiled by the shogun in the 17th century. It is now a Buddhist temple.\n\n\n== Literature and art of the Japanese garden ==\n\n\n=== Garden manuals ===\nThe first manual of Japanese gardening was the Sakuteiki (\"Records of Garden Making\"), probably written in the late eleventh century by Tachibana no Tohshitsuna (1028\u20131094). Citing even older Chinese sources, it explains how to organize the garden, from the placement of rocks and streams to the correct depth of ponds and height of cascades. While it was based on earlier Chinese garden principles, it also expressed ideas which were unique to Japanese gardens, such as islands, beaches and rock formations imitating Japanese maritime landscapes.Besides giving advice, Sakuteiki also gives dire warnings of what happens if the rules are not followed; the author warns that if a rock that in nature was in a horizontal position is stood upright in a garden, it will bring misfortune to the owner of the garden. And, if a large rock pointed toward the north or west is placed near a gallery, the owner of the garden will be forced to leave before a year passes.Another influential work about the Japanese garden, bonseki, bonsai and related arts was Rhymeprose on a Miniature Landscape Garden (around 1300) by the Zen monk Kokan Shiren, which explained how meditation on a miniature garden purified the senses and the mind and led to understanding of the correct relationship between man and nature.\nOther influential garden manuals which helped to define the aesthetics of the Japanese garden are Senzui Narabi ni Yagyo no Zu (Illustrations for Designing Mountain, Water and Hillside Field Landscapes), written in the fifteenth century, and Tsukiyama Teizoden (Building Mountains and Making Gardens), from the 18th century. The tradition of Japanese gardening was historically passed down from sensei to apprentice. The opening words of Illustrations for designing mountain, water and hillside field landscapes (1466) are \"If you have not received the oral transmissions, you must not make gardens\" and its closing admonition is \"You must never show this writing to outsiders. You must keep it secret\".These garden manuals are still studied today.\n\n\n=== Gardens in literature and poetry ===\nThe Tale of Genji, the classic Japanese novel of the Heian period, describes the role of the Japanese garden in court life. The characters attend festivals in the old Kyoto imperial palace garden, take boat trips on the lake, listen to music and watch formal dances under the trees.Gardens were often the subject of poems during the Heian period. A poem in one anthology from the period, the Kokin-Shu, described the Kiku-shima, or island of chrystanthemums, found in the Osawa pond in the great garden of the period called Saga-in.\n\nI had thought that here\nonly one chrysanthmum can grow.\nWho therefore has planted\nthe other in the depths\nof the pond of Osawa?Another poem of the Heian period, in the Hyakunin isshu, described a cascade of rocks, which simulated a waterfall, in the same garden:\n\nThe cascade long ago\nceased to roar,\nBut we continue to hear\nThe murmur\nof its name.\n\n\n=== Philosophy, painting, and the Japanese garden ===\n\nIn Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, equal to the arts of calligraphy and ink painting. Gardens are considered three-dimensional textbooks of Daoism and Zen Buddhism. Sometimes the lesson is very literal; the garden of Saih\u014d-ji featured a pond shaped like the Japanese character shin (\u5fc3) or x\u012bn in Chinese, the heart-spirit of Chinese philosophy, the newspaper character is \u5fc3 but it's the full cursive, the sousho style (\u8349\u66f8) for shin that would be used; sousho, this well-named \"grass writing\", would be appropriate for gardening purpose indeed, for in cursive writing the character shapes change depending on the context and of course, since it is cursive, depending on the person -that is to say that the character would be done in a single pencil stroke, it would match the state of mind and the context rather than the newspaper print.\nHowever, usually the lessons are contained in the arrangements of the rocks, the water and the plants. For example, the lotus flower has a particular message; Its roots are in the mud at the bottom of the pond, symbolizing the misery of the human condition, but its flower is pure white, symbolizing the purity of spirit that can be achieved by following the teachings of the Buddha.\nThe Japanese rock gardens were intended to be intellectual puzzles for the monks who lived next to them to study and solve. They followed the same principles as the suiboku-ga, the black-and-white Japanese inks paintings of the same period, which, according to Zen Buddhist principles, tried to achieve the maximum effect using the minimum essential elements.\n\nOne painter who influenced the Japanese garden was Josetsu (1405\u20131423), a Chinese Zen monk who moved to Japan and introduced a new style of ink-brush painting, moving away from the romantic misty landscapes of the earlier period, and using asymmetry and areas of white space, similar to the white space created by sand in zen gardens, to set apart and highlight a mountain or tree branch or other element of his painting. He became chief painter of the Shogun and influenced a generation of painters and garden designers.Japanese gardens also follow the principles of perspective of Japanese landscape painting, which feature a close-up plane, an intermediate plane, and a distant plane. The empty space between the different planes has a great importance, and is filled with water, moss, or sand. The garden designers used various optical tricks to give the garden the illusion of being larger than it really is, by borrowing of scenery (\"shakkei\"), employing distant views outside the garden, or using miniature trees and bushes to create the illusion that they are far away.\n\n\n== Noteworthy Japanese gardens ==\n\n\n=== In Japan ===\n\nThe Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of the government of Japan designates the most notable of the nation's scenic beauty as Special Places of Scenic Beauty, under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. As of March 2007, 29 sites are listed, more than a half of which are Japanese gardens (boldface entries specify World Heritage Sites):\n\nT\u014dhoku region\nM\u014dts\u016b-ji Garden (Hiraizumi, Iwate)\nKant\u014d region\nKairaku-en (Mito, Ibaraki)\nRikugi-en (Bunky\u014d, Tokyo)\nKyu Hamarikyu Gardens (Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo)\nCh\u016bbu region\nKenroku-en (Kanazawa, Ishikawa)\nIchij\u014ddani Asakura Family Gardens (Fukui, Fukui)\nKansai region\nBy\u014dd\u014d-in Garden (Uji, Kyoto)\nJisho-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nNij\u014d Castle Ninomaru Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nRokuon-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nRy\u014dan-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nTenry\u016b-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe garden of Sanb\u014din in Daigo-ji (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe moss garden of Saih\u014d-ji (the \"Moss Temple\") (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nDaitoku-ji Garden (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nThe garden of Daisen-in in Daitoku-ji (Kyoto, Kyoto)\nMurin-an garden, Kyoto, Kyoto\nNegoro-ji Garden (Iwade, Wakayama)\nCh\u016bgoku region\nAdachi Museum of Art Garden (Yasugi, Shimane)\nK\u014draku-en (Okayama, Okayama)\nMatsue Vogel Park (Matsue)\nSh\u016braku-en (Tsuyama)\nShikoku Region\nRitsurin Garden (Takamatsu, Kagawa)\nNakatsu Banshoen (Marugame, Kagawa)\nTensha-en (Uwajima, Ehime)\nKyushu Region\nSuizen-ji J\u014dju-en (Kumamoto, Kumamoto)\nSengan-en (Kagoshima, Kagoshima)\nRy\u016bky\u016b Islands\nShikina-en (Naha, Okinawa)However, the Education Minister is not eligible to have jurisdiction over any imperial property. These two gardens, administered by Imperial Household Agency, are also considered to be great masterpieces.\n\nKatsura Imperial Villa\nShugaku-in Imperial Villa\n\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\n\nSeveral Japanese gardens were built during Japanese Taiwan period.\n\nTaipei Guest House\nBeitou Plum Garden, in Beitou, Taipei\nBeitou Museum, in Beitou, Taipei\n\n\n=== In English-speaking countries ===\n\nThe aesthetic of Japanese gardens was introduced to the English-speaking community by Josiah Conder's Landscape Gardening in Japan (Kelly & Walsh, 1893). It sparked the first Japanese gardens in the West. A second edition was required in 1912. Conder's principles have sometimes proved hard to follow:\n\nRobbed of its local garb and mannerisms, the Japanese method reveals aesthetic principles applicable to the gardens of any country, teaching, as it does, how to convert into a poem or picture a composition, which, with all its variety of detail, otherwise lacks unity and intent.\nSamuel Newsom's Japanese Garden Construction (1939) offered Japanese aesthetic as a corrective in the construction of rock gardens, which owed their quite separate origins in the West to the mid-19th century desire to grow alpines in an approximation of Alpine scree.\nAccording to the Garden History Society, Japanese landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto was involved in the development of around 200 gardens in the UK. In 1937 he exhibited a rock garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, and worked on the Burngreave Estate at Bognor Regis, and also on a Japanese garden at Cottered in Hertfordshire. The lush courtyards at Du Cane Court \u2013 an art deco block of flats in Balham, London, built between 1935 and 1938 \u2013 were designed by Kusumoto. All four courtyards there may have originally contained ponds. Only one survives, and this is stocked with koi. There are also several stone lanterns, which are meant to symbolise the illumination of one's path through life; similarly, the paths through the gardens are not straight. Japanese maple, Japanese anemone, cherry trees, evergreens, and bamboo are other typical features of Du Cane Court's gardens.According to David A. Slawson, many of the Japanese gardens that are recreated in the US are of \"museum-piece quality\". He also writes, however, that as the gardens have been introduced into the Western world, they have become more Americanized, decreasing their natural beauty.\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nAdelaide Himeji Garden\nAuburn Botanical Gardens, in Sydney, New South Wales\nCanberra Nara Peace Park in Lennox Gardens, Canberra\nCowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre, Cowra, New South Wales\nMelbourne Zoo\nNerima Gardens, Ipswich\nRoyal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, Hobart\n\"Tsuki-yama-chisen\" Japanese Garden, Brisbane\nUniversity of Southern Queensland Japanese Garden, \"Ju Raku En\", Toowomba, Queensland\n\n\n==== Canada ====\n\nNitobe Memorial Garden, Vancouver, British Columbia\nThe University of Alberta Botanic Garden, Edmonton, Alberta, formerly named the Devonian Botanic Garden, which contains an extensive Japanese garden\nNikka Yuko Japanese Garden, Lethbridge, Alberta\nThe Japanese Garden and Pavilion, Montreal Botanical Garden, Quebec\nKariya Park, Mississauga, Ontario\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nEngland\n\nCompton Acres, Dorset\nDartington Hall, Devon\nHall Park, Leeds\nHarewood House, Leeds\nHolland Park, London\nSt Mawgan in Pydar, Cornwall\nTatton Park, Cheshire\nSchool of Oriental and African Studies, LondonNorthern Ireland\n\nSir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park, Belfast\nFujiyama Japanese GardenScotland\n\nLauriston Castle, Edinburgh \u2013 garden opened 2002\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\n\nThe Japanese Gardens at the Irish National Stud, Kildare, Co.

          "Gorgeous gardens divided into different sections - woods, western, Japanese etc. I was a bit disappointed that the greenhouse had a closed sign 30 mins before closing meaning I missed this part of the gardens. 500 yen entrance fee.",
          "On one of our last days in Tokyo, we decided to visit Shinjuku Gyoen - a nice, leisurely walk from our hotel. We arrived right as the gates opened (9am) which was perfect as we practically had the whole place to ourselves. The surrounds were beautifully kept and just absolutely",
          "Lovely garden, I am sure it would be more beautiful in spring and summer. We liked the Japanese garden and large open spaces. Fee for entry for adults, students need to show id for discount. Cafe and greenhouses",
          "These gardens were beautiful and well worth the visit. It makes for a nice leisurely walk though landscaped areas, lakes, avenues lined with trees, a rose garden and huge green spaces, even a tea house though was closed when I was there so be certain of the opening times. There",
          "Worth the visit. Japanese gardens are always lovely, no matter what time of the year. We enjoyed getting out of the subways and shopping precincts and crowds, for a walk amongst nature :)",
          "Famous for cherry blossoms and Autumn leaves. I visited during winter and not crowded. Good to walk around and bring some food to eat here.",
          "we visited this place during the winter , so did not see anything.. all trees are brown in color.. might visit again during summer and i can imagine how beautiful this will be",
          "If you go to Shinjuku, you can enjoy not only shopping but also relaxing at this huge park. First time when I visit, I couldn't believe this kind of park is in middle of Shinjuku. This park is big and has some themes. Stunning place. There is a green field, too so sometime I go",
          "Visit in winter time with a very nice weather. Park has very big space to walk along, experience the beautiful garden, big tree and lake scenery. The traditional japanese garden and Green house are beautiful and attractive. There are some tea cafe to take some rest, drink hot",
          "Great to get away from the crowds and relax but not amazing or spectacular. Great walks and very relaxing. 500 yen entry fee",
          "This garden had many cherry blossom trees. However, in winter season for our visit, we found the garden very dry and grass yellowish. Hardly any flowers and land mostly barren grounds. If you go, recommend to visit the water pond area in the Japanese garden section.",
          "Absolutely beautiful!! I felt like it was Japan\u2019s version of Central Park- the city skyscrapers were all around but this little piece of heaven. We walked all over this park- it was so peaceful when the city outside is a hustle and bustle. There was so much beauty in the history",
          "What a wonderful garden to view the cherry blossoms and have a picnic beneath these gorgeous trees! So many gals in kimonos too. Be camera ready!",

          "Massive beautiful garden near Shinjuku. Whether you're visiting for Cherry Blossoms in March/April or Autumn Colours in November/December, this beautiful park has it all. And don't miss the Greenhouse for something a little different.",
          "A must visit if you are in Shinjuku. Great walking, gardens and ponds. The traditional Japanese garden was my favorite. Lots of big old trees too!",
          "It was a beautiful walk around the garden. It was big. Took us about more than an hour to slowly explore the grounds. The centre in a lovely place to just lay on the grass and enjoy a picnic and the sun. Adults pay 500 yen. If you are 15 years and younger, you get in for free.",
          "I took a day trip to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden and loved it. It's a beautiful place which I can only imagine is even more spectacular in warmer seasons when the cherry blossoms are in bloom.",
          "Beautiful and huge garden with long walks, flowers and water features. Felt very cool and peaceful. Food and drinks available. Directions very well marked plus an indoor display garden. There is a entry fee and seniors get a discount",
          "This is one place I never miss in Shinjuku. Whatever be the season the national park is beautiful, peaceful and full of life. This time around in winters, it was beautful, trees covered in colorful shades of leaves, bright day added to the beauty. It is very close to Shinjuku",
          "I in the National garden this month, lovely colours but, due to the Typhoon damage, some areas were out of bounds. But had a enjoyed my 3 hours walking round.",
          "Walked around this great gardens in the morning sunshine. Took some lovely photographs. Beautiful scenery, ponds and lakes. Very calm, quiet and peaceful.",
          "Very beautiful and pretty peaceful place. I bet the forest area would be nice and cooling in the summer. Love to re-visit in other season",
          "A true representation of Japan - pristine, balanced, intricate, uncluttered and artistic attention to detail. This garden is amazing! It is so beautiful to walk around especially during cherry blossom season. The cost is \u00a5500 for an adult to enter but it is worth it. There",
          "I'd love to have one of these parks in my neighborhood, but I'm not too sure it's a tourist activity. It has plenty of well-kept lawn to relax on, a solid greenhouse with plants from all over (with a Japanese touch especially where it's involved in endangered plant species",
          "Definitely a highlight when visiting Japan! Tokyo is a wonderful city with lots to do, but this should definitely be on your to-do list. Plan good walking shoes, and a few hours to enjoy. Concessions & vending machines for drinks in middle of park-priced reasonably. Gorgeous",
          "I love this garden! It's amazingly well-manicured garden that's a photographer's dream. I've been to many fantastic parks (NY's Central Park, London's Hyde Park, etc) and this blows them away! There are also numerous rest areas in the garden which sells some small eats/drinks.",
          "great place to walk if the weather is nice. beautiful park, water with a picture perfect setting. worth a visit.",
          "I wasn\u2019t expecting anything other than a park. It opens up into the Tokyo version of NY\u2019s Central Park, but much nicer. This is a can\u2019miss on your list of things to do in Tokyo.",
          "We went there last week. Entry fee is 500yen per person. They use vending machine to sell the ticket which is pretty cool. Since we just came back from Mt. Fuji, the autumn leaves in this park is nothing to compare to the ones in lake Kawaguchi. Maybe they we\u2019re blown away by",
          "We decided on our last day in Tokyo to be more relax and walk in the park. Reminds me of NY Central Park with views of the buildings in Shinjuku. Very relaxing. You see families with kids playing on a beautiful Saturday. There is an entrance fee for adults 500 yen and free",
          "It was really nice, and since it was fall the leaves in this part of the garden were all colours of fall, really pretty. Some places were closed off due to the typhoon tho :(",
          "We went at what was called \"peak\" for autumn foliage and, while it was lovely, there are more stunning places in or shortly outside Tokyo. But \"peak\" sakura (cherry blossoms) are awesome and everywhere. Because it is just a short walk from Shinjuku station and subways, it",
          "This is a stunning garden with many lovely sections. Such a wonderful oasis in crowded busy Tokyo. Worth at least two hours to revive and reconnect with nature",
          "Good to walk around on a hot day. Very well laid out some open spaces amd lots to explore - good cafe located within the grounds. Easy to get around",
          "Very quiet and tranquil compare to Meiji Jingu park. Very large park. Very relaxing and close to transport. Would recommend.",

          "Nice park. Clean and beatiful. Very nice place for some peace and quiet in all the noise of the city. It costs money to visit the park, but not much at all. Worth it.",
          "The entry price has gone up to \u00a5500. Not worth it without the chrysanthemums exhibit, too early for autumn colours (prob next weekend) and parts closed",
          "Definitely a park to go to with friends or family! A good place for picnic. Awesome during fall when scenery is starting to change!",
          "Lovely garden, well worth the visit. Second time there and found it a lovely, well kept garden that has a peaceful and relaxing feel.",
          "Was a fantastic park/garden. Well kept and lakes and trees were spectacular. Visited on a Sunday when it seems all local families go for a walk.",
          "With all the hustle and bustle of Tokyo there are not many quiet areas but this is one. 500 yen to get in and you can spend the day there wandering the paths and looking at all the gardens and plants. Some nice lakes. A very peaceful spot and one of the highlights of tokyo",
          "A walk through these beautiful gardens is a wonderful experience given the various different and thought provoking scenery. A welcome break from the hectic city life and traffic. Plants from around the world, beautiful flower arrangements and a large greenhouse all offer a very",
          "Although we visited on November we did a lot of fun. I had to stop the hole time in order to take pictures. Every corner and plant is so carefully treated and looks nice ! The 500 yen to pay is not much for such a nice place.",
          "I was there during sakura time, the lines to enter Shinjuku Gyoen were insane, but because it's so spacious inside, it didn't feel like a lot of people. And blooming sakura trees were soo beautiful",
          "We went here a bit before sunset and had a chance to explore most of the garden. As everything in Tokyo, this garden is beautifully manicured and very clean. Great for a peaceful stroll!",
          "There is a small entrance fee which, coming from the UK, seemed unusual. However, it offered a lovely respite from the rest of busy busy Shinjuku. Lakes with koi and turtles surrounded by beautiful gardens with the contrasting background of the skyscrapers.",
          "Very disappointed to visit the park in reality against all the 5 stars ratings given in the review. The park was huge and full of green. Nothing extraordinary to see and experience except the chrysanthemum flowers display which was just OK. The entrance fee of \u00a5500 per adult was",
          "Even on a grey day, this was a great break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Strolling through park seemed to rejuvenate me after the long flight and figuring out the city. The Japanese are masters of landscaping and it is on full display here.",
          "I spent nearly 3 hours taking in the remarkable beauty of this national treasure. It's nicely laid out with toilets unassumingly tucked away. It's a large park with lots of open space perfect for a family picnic. The greenhouse was the highlight for me. Think absolutely",
          "This is an oasis in the midst of a bustling city. Its 144 acres are divided into Japanese landscape garden, English and French. We only saw the Japanese, which includes a quick peak of a soon-to-be-bride being photographed by the side of a pond. Perhaps we did not see the other",
          "My husband and I spent our last morning in Tokyo here and it was a great way to relax and decompress from all the train riding and traversing through the city all week. We went in October, just a week after the typhoon so some sections were closed and just before all the autumn",
          "After a morning walking around the busy shopping centres of Tokyo, taking a well-earned break at these stunning gardens provided a counterpoint to the hustle and bustle. The green house have a good collection of plants whilst the old tea rooms and lakes provide a timeless sense",
          "Quite some areas are still closed due to the impact of the Typhoon. Moreover, October does not seem to be the best month to get most out of this park as flowers blooming is mainly limited to the rose garden and it is too early for real Autumn leaves experience",
          "This is a very big park in the middle of a bustling area making it a very good place to chill out. Unfortunately, a typhoon hit Tokyo three days before our visit so there was quite a bit of tree damaged, closed walks and closed tea houses that were damaged. However, we still",

          "A pleasant walk around the gardens in the sunshine. We stopped for tea in the traditional tea room which was a fun experience. Beautifully maintained gardens despite the recent typhoons and well worth the visit",
          "You canot travel to Japan and Tokyo and not visited the parts! Every parts is different and very well described. This is a real pleasure and a source of case in this flamboyant city",
          "First day in Tokyo, a great place to stretch out the achy limbs. Quite a lot of restorative work ongoing getting ready for the Olympic visitors",
          "Japanese garden was pretty, pity the tea houses were closed. Nice for a stroll in a park, greenhouse had some unusual plants. Wouldn\u2019t rush to see it if you\u2019ve got limited time in Tokyo - if you\u2019ve got loads of time you can pay for a bit of peace and quiet.",
          "The gardens are fabulous and very quiet given how busy the surrounding areas are. The greenhouse is also well worth the visit. We spent nearly 3 hours there. Loved it.",
          "Visited these gardens as they weren\u2019t far from our hotel, after a day of exploring. A lovely way to finish the day. Beautiful, serene, calm and the direct opposite of all that was going on outside it\u2019s perimeters. Well worth taking a stroll around these gardens.",
          "Cost 500 Yen which gives you access to the large gardens with three different designs, we loved the Japanese gardens the best and the Imperial Greenhouse. A beautiful walk in the rain with a lovely tea house break in the middle.",
          "You people just have to go there and enjoy. You can even close your eyes and just breathe the air. It is a bliss... I am saying that, as I have been just locked at my hotel room, due to the recent Typhoon; any fresh air is good after that, but that place is really worth",
          "If you want to take a breather, I suggest heading to the Garden and Greenhouse. It is a lengthy walk but many benches and rest areas to catch a moment.",
          "This place is huge! Stunning gardens though, and a wide variety, from traditional japanese, to english rose garden and even a glasshouse. Even though it wasn't really the season for them, we managed to luck out and find a few cherry blossom trees that had begun to flower early,",
          "I guess October isn\u2019t the best time to be visiting Japanese gardens and with the preparations for the olympics this garden is currently not really showing at its best. Give it a few weeks and the leaves changing may make it worth the effort.",
          "With a mid morning arrival, we spent a day with glorious weather in an enormous and beautiful park setting. The colours of the cherry blossoms were bright and vibrant and the variety of the various schemed parts of the park made for a very rewarding visit. It was late in the",
          "This is a big park located in shinjuku which surrounded by tall buildings. You can find a lot of trees and flowers during sakura season. They also have botanical garden, japanese garden, western style garden. Definitly a place to see if you enjoy trees.",
          "Came here to wait until we could get into our hotel room. Lovely gardens, and glasshouses to visit. Even on a rainy day it was a nice escape from the city traffic and noise.",

          "Had a such a beautiful morning strolling through this garden. It was a lot bigger than I was expecting with rolling lawns, zen-filled streams and bridges and beautiful traditional buildings. We were staying in Shinjuku and walked from one side to the other continuing on to",
          "Only need about an hour and it\u2019s a great opportunity to see Japanese gardens done really well. Went non-cherry blossom session and it was still beautiful.",
          "You need to pay to get in to the garden and it is nothing special (in comparison to most other countries I suppose). A fair few mosquitoes around so make sure you have appropriate gear for this.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the park as a bit of respite from the business of the city. We enjoyed having a little picnic with bento boxes purchased from a nearby department store. Look for the teahouses to find rubbish bins! There's plenty to see in the park including buildings, ponds",
          "Even in the dead heat of summer, this garden was amazingly beautiful and lush. Each section has its own aesthetic, but all are traditionally Japanese. There are ponds, authentic tea houses, bridges, sculptures, wide-open spaces, with a modern skyline as the backdrop in many",
          "The garden is beautiful and artistically done. In the tea garden, especially, every angle is wonderfully composed, like a painting. Some reviewers said this garden wasn't anything special, but for me, who had only seen Japanese-inspired landscaping in non-Japanese botanical",
          "It was very interesting to walk through this garden/park. There are amazing large trees that we don\u2019t see in North America. The lawns were huge and being enjoyed by many people on a hot evening. I do think that botanically it is a little tired and IMHO experiencing a lack of",
          "Spent one morning here, they charged us \u00a5500 per person to get in. We were searching for the traditional Japanese garden - passed English and French, the place is huge. There is traditional tea house and Japanese garden is beautiful.",

          "The gardens surrounding the Shrine were a great place to be in the heat of that day. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Nice clean and quiet central park with excellent routes and good signage. The water features are very nice (as you'd expect in Japan) and there is a small cafe. Plenty of vending machines around if it's a hot day and you need a cool drink!",
          "Well worth the meagre entry price - huge gardens, very well kept, and not hugely busy so felt very tranquil and away from the hustle and bustle of tokyo. Good facilites, and a nice little gift shop/cafes etc.",
          "Cherry blossoms, yes but what people don't always talk about are the little tea houses inside the park. Great for kids to get a taste of a tea house. My 7 and 5 year old shared a tea and dessert with me. We were quiet and enjoyed witnessing this tradition.",
          "I had to the opportunity to visit the park at my arrival to Tokio. After a very long and crowded trip. It was such a refresh to walk in this quiet place enjoying the gardens and palaces within.",
          "What a lovely place. The garden is so huge and the scenery is so wonderful. The entrance fee for adult is 500\u00a5 but it was worth every yen!",

          "If you like botanical gardens, don't miss it, also if you are in Tokyo in Spring, DO NOT miss it, excellent site for cherry tree watching. At any other time of year, the green house is a delight of tropical and desert plants.",
          "The beauty of this place hits all your senses, the smells, the sounds (or lack thereof in the middle of Tokyo), the sights and incredible plant life. Great place to get away,",
          "This garden is a wonderful and ideal place for a picnic, especially in the spring when all the trees and flowers are blooming and not too hot. A best place for spend time in relax.",
          "This gardent is worth the visit.It is a great selection for who want have a memorable Trip. It is a very friendly place with toilet every where.Morever it also have other varieties of flowers like tulips and azaleas,which make me impress and will never forget.However I hope it",
          "Pretty park, but not worth it to pay for it. There are plenty of other pretty free parks in the city you can go to instead.",
          "I was surprised to see a price to enter this park when most other tourist spots were free. It was lovely and shaded and must be a sight to see during Cherry Blossoms ! It was quiet and peaceful and a good moment to get away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Reminded me of",

We only stayed for 30min because of the crushing heat, so I didn\u2019t get to see everything, but it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. Beautiful Japanese gardens and",
          "Spent some time wandering through these gardens soaking in the traditional Japanese garden feel and look. The time of the visit was not good from a flowering perspective, but nonetheless the gardens were refreshing and attractive on an otherwise typical hot summer day. Within",
          "Enjoyed these beautiful gardens and especially the walk through the old residence which has been wonderfully maintained. The green house was excellent and the amenities superb. Worth the money if you have the time to visit.",
          "Nice and quiet place. I recomend this place if you want to rest a little bit from the city rush. There wera actually a lot of people, but the garden is big enough, so you can enjoy the greenery and some peace on the bench.",
          "One of the best gardens in Tokyo and conveniently located near Shinjuku station. In the Autumn you can see the leaves changing colour which is lovely for a stroll around. The garden is bigger than I expected and you could spend an hour or longer inside. It\u2019s a very quiet,",

          "This is a must visit when in Shinjuku. I\u2019ll admit, at first it didn\u2019t sound that interesting to me since we had so many other choices, but that changed quickly. It is so quite and peaceful here and a great place to just take a stroll and admire Japan\u2019s beauty. It was a little",

          "A very hot summer, bring your shades and hat! The garden was well curated, giant bonzai plants were pretty. Quiet park.",
          "Honestly, I was not aware how popular this park was with tourists. I got the idea to visit here from one of my favourite anime and came last week. There's an admission charge which I guess is ok to upkeep the park. Students do get discounts as well as the elderly, make sure you",
          "We visited Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in the midst of the cherry blossoms season, and it was magnificent! We visited other cherry blossom areas in Tokyo at that time, but Shinjuku Gyoen is the best of them all! From Shinjuku Station, we took a short train ride. It is a bit",
          "Easy to get to from Shinjuku or Yoyogi station. Full of magnificent trees, lots of ancient cherries, it would be spectacular in blossom. Beautiful rose garden, all named. An oasis in the city there are places where you could be miles from a city then around a corner & there's a",

          "This garden was a welcome relief from the buzz of the metropolitan area. A quiet oasis. We were there after a long hot dry spell and then major storm. So not at its 100% best but pretty good. A number of cafes/ vending machines around the park meant that could always get iced",
          "It's a really beautiful garden. It's relaxing and has great views. Very enjoyable to stroll around with friends and take in the nature.",
          "Good place to enjoy hanami with friends and family! Was sad to know that the entrance fee had increased from 200 to 500 yen from April onwards. Nevertheless, a must to visit especially during the Sakura season!",

          "Visited about a week before all the trees were in full bloom, but still saw quite a few trees in full blossom. It\u2019s a short walk from the heart of Shinjuku and well worth the admission fee. There weren\u2019t many visitors but they were clustered around the trees in bloom, which",

          "We spent nearly 3 hours today enjoying these lovely gardens and some early cherry blossoms. Very scenic and relaxing. It feels quite a bit like Central Park in New York City. Great spot for a picnic lunch too. The best part is the traditonal Japanese garden and Green house.",

          "We went to the gardens for a casual stroll. We have been before. There are 2 main gates to enter so pay attention to your Google directions. Access is not allowed along the perimeters. The two best parts of our morning stroll were the Chinese Pavillion and the lone cherry tree",
          "Shinjuku Gyoen national garden was highly recommended in the guidebooks I reviewed before my visit to Tokyo but I did not think it was anything special. I visited just after 9am opening and it was so quiet it was hard to remember I was in the middle of one of the biggest cities",
          "Shinjuku Gyoen is a very large stroll garden with a couple of very beautiful areas and the rest so-so. The large lawn with umbrella-like pines is very lovely, and a great place to lounge on a sunny day. Likewise the Upper Pond area is a very nicely landscaped area around a large",

          "A beautiful quiet place in the middle of a major city! It's out of season so the grass is brown and a lot of the trees are bare. However even with that it's worth a visit, also the botanical gardens! The best bit for me is the Sakura has started to bloom. The cost is only 200",
          "A well kept enormous park. Costs 200\u00a5 which is good value. Japanese garden was lovely but we didn't go early enough and you get asked to leave at 4.30pm.",

          "We went in winter, so there wasn't much to see, but it was still very well kept, and a nice walk around. The greenhouse as well had lots to see, and flowers and plants were in bloom there so definitely worth a visit. Given the layout of the trees, I can imagine this would be",
          "This was my second visit to Shinjuku Gyoen as I got the chance to visit in 2017 and had to come again. Entry is cheap but so worth a visit. The greenhouse is fantastic at all times of year though plants do bloom seasonally so it is worth multiple visits! There are plenty of",
          "We went early one morning right in the middle of sakura season. We arrived at the main entrance which was very crowded. As you enter the park people start to spread out, but many go for the area with a lot of sakura trees. As you wander away there are still lots of sakura petals",

        "wiki": "Staff Sergeant Reckless (c. 1948 \u2013 May 13, 1968), a decorated war horse who held official rank in the United States military, was a mare of Mongolian horse breeding.  Out of a race horse dam, she was purchased in October 1952 for $250 from a Korean stableboy at the Seoul racetrack who needed money to buy an artificial leg for his sister.  Reckless was bought by members of the United States Marine Corps and trained to be a pack horse for the Recoilless Rifle Platoon, Anti-Tank Company, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. She quickly became part of the unit and was allowed to roam freely through camp, entering the Marines' tents, where she would sleep on cold nights, and was known for her willingness to eat nearly anything, including scrambled eggs, beer, Coca-Cola and, once, about $30 worth of poker chips.\nShe served in numerous combat actions during the Korean War, carrying supplies and ammunition, and was also used to evacuate wounded.  Learning each supply route after only a couple of trips, she often traveled to deliver supplies to the troops on her own, without benefit of a handler. The highlight of her nine-month military career came in late March 1953 during the Battle for Outpost Vegas when, in a single day, she made 51 solo trips to resupply multiple front line units. She was wounded in combat twice, given the battlefield rank of corporal in 1953, and then a battlefield promotion to sergeant in 1954, several months after the war ended.  She also became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing, and following the war was awarded two Purple Hearts, a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, was included in her unit's Presidential Unit Citations from two countries, as well as other military honors.\nHer wartime service record was featured in The Saturday Evening Post, and LIFE magazine recognized her as one of America's 100 all-time heroes. She was retired and brought to the United States after the war, where she made appearances on television and participated in the United States Marine Corps birthday ball. She was officially promoted to staff sergeant in 1959 by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  She gave birth to four foals in America and died in May 1968. A plaque and photo were dedicated in her honor at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton stables and a statue of her was dedicated on July 26, 2013 at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia. On May 12, 2018, a bronze statue of Sergeant Reckless was placed and dedicated in the Kentucky Horse Park, Lexington Kentucky.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nSergeant Reckless was chestnut colored with a blaze and three white stockings. Her date of birth and parentage are unconfirmed, but she was estimated to be around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk-moon (\uae40\ud601\ubb38 or \uae40\ud751\ubb38), though that was not his real name. The horse was known as originally named \"\uc544\uce68\ud574\" (Ah Chim Hai, Korean pronunciation: [a tsim h\u00e6]) in Korean, which translates to \"Morning Sun\" or \"Sun-of-the-Morning\", also known as \"\uc5ec\uba85\" (Yeo Myeong) in Korean, which translates to \"light of dawn\", \"Morning Flame\" or \"Flame-of-the-Morning\" also reputed to be the name of her dam, a racehorse at the track in Seoul. Kim Huk-moon sold the horse, whom he had nicknamed \"Flame\", to Lieutenant Eric Pedersen for $250 in order to buy a leg prosthesis for his sister, who had stepped on a land mine. The horse's breeding was thought to be primarily Mongolian though she did have some features, particularly the shape of her head, that were similar to horses of Thoroughbred lineage. She was small, standing only 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm) and weighing 900 pounds (410 kg).\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\nIn October 1952, Pedersen received permission from Colonel Eustace P. Smoak to purchase a horse for his platoon. Based in mountainous terrain, Pederson needed a pack animal capable of carrying up to nine of the heavy 24-pound shells needed to supply the recoilless rifles used by his unit, the Recoilless Rifle Platoon of the 5th Marine Regiment. The day after he received permission, on  October 26, 1952, Pedersen, Sergeant Willard Berry, and Corporal Philip Carter drove a jeep with a trailer to the Seoul racetrack. Pedersen paid for the horse with his own money. Moon was reluctant to sell the horse, though he needed to, and cried when \"Flame\" departed.  The Marines renamed her \"Reckless\" as a contraction of the name of the Recoilless rifle and a nod to the daredevil attitude associated with those who used the gun.Her primary trainer and the person Reckless was closest to was platoon Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Latham. Private First Class Monroe Coleman was her primary caretaker. In addition to Pedersen, Latham, and Coleman, Lieutenant Bill Riley and Sergeant Elmer Lively were also involved with the training and care of Reckless. Pedersen had his wife ship a pack saddle from their home in California so Reckless could better fulfill her primary role as a pack animal. The recoilless rifle platoon had its own medical corpsman, Navy Hospitalman First Class George \"Doc\" Mitchell, who provided the majority of medical care for Reckless.The Marines, especially Latham, taught Reckless battlefield survival skills such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, \"incoming!\" The platoon called it her \"hoof training\" and \"hoof camp\". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond of a wide variety of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day.  Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.\n\nReckless's baptism under fire came at a place called Hedley's Crotch, near the villages of Changdan and Kwakchan. Though loaded down with six  recoilless rifle shells, she initially \"went straight up\" and all four feet left the ground the first time the Recoilless Rifle was fired. When she landed she started shaking, but Coleman, her handler, calmed her down.  The second time the gun fired she merely snorted, and by the end of the mission that day appeared calm and was seen trying to eat a discarded helmet liner. She even appeared to take an interest in the operation of the weapon. When learning a new delivery route, Reckless would only need someone to lead her a few times. Afterwards she would make the trips on her own. There was a standing order not to ride Reckless, but in early December 1952, someone violated that order and took Reckless on a ride that included a sprint through a minefield. She was not injured during the unauthorized ride.Her most significant accomplishment came during the Battle of Panmunjom-Vegas (also known as the Battle of Outpost Vegas/Vegas Hill) over the period March 26\u201328, 1953, when she made 51 solo trips in a single day, carrying a total of 386 recoilless rounds (over 9,000 pounds, carrying 4 to 8 24-pound shells on each trip) covering over 35 miles that day. The whole Battle of Vegas lasted 3 days. She was wounded twice during the battle: once when she was hit by shrapnel over the left eye and another time on her left flank.  For her accomplishments during the Battle of Vegas Hill, Reckless was promoted to corporal.\n\nWhen not on the front lines, Reckless packed other items for the platoon, and was particularly useful for stringing telephone wire. Carrying reels of wire on her pack that were played out as she walked, she could string as much wire as twelve men on foot. She became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing when the 5th moved from Camp Casey to Inchon, planning to participate in amphibious landings hundreds of miles south of Inchon. The commanding officer of the transport halted loading operations when he saw the platoon on the dock with Reckless. He refused to take her on board his clean ship, which had won an award for being the cleanest ship in the previous two years. She was allowed on board after the Marines produced the loading plan, approved by him, which specifically listed Reckless and her equipment. Once the ship was underway, she became sick, making a mess on the ship's decks during the first part of the voyage. She could not be disembarked due to a storm, but soon became accustomed to the motion of the ship at sea and had no more problems. The 1st Marine Division was moved to a rest area soon after the move, and while there some platoon members posed with Reckless and a sign challenging the Thoroughbred Native Dancer to a race. They called their race the \"Paddy Derby\", the field \"Upsan Downs\", and the conditions differed from a typical horse race: 1.5 miles over paddies and hills, carrying 192 pounds of ammunition, and no riders. The Marines never received a reply; Native Dancer came in second in the Kentucky Derby, and went on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.Randolph M. Pate, then the commander of the 1st Marine Division, gave Reckless a battlefield promotion from corporal to sergeant in a formal ceremony, complete with reviewing stand, on April 10, 1954, several months after the war ended. She was also given a red and gold blanket with insignia. Reckless was promoted again, to staff sergeant (E-6), on August 31, 1959, at Camp Pendleton, California. This promotion was also awarded by Pate, then the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Pate personally presided over the ceremony, and Reckless was honored with a 19-gun salute and a 1,700-man parade of Marines from her wartime unit. She was an early example of an animal holding official rank in a branch of the United States military.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\n\nFor her exemplary service to the Marine Corps, Reckless was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds received during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation with bronze star, the National Defense Service Medal, a Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Korea Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. She would wear these awards on her horse blanket, plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.An article in The Saturday Evening Post, published on April 17, 1954, while Reckless was still in Korea, resulted in a campaign by American supporters to get the Marines to bring her to the United States. An executive at Pacific Transport Lines, Stan Coppel, read the article and offered to let Reckless ride free on one of his company's ships from Yokohama to San Francisco. Prior to her departure for America, a ceremony, including a band, for Reckless' rotation to the United States was held during half time of a football game between the Marine Corps and Army. Reckless left Korea  for Japan aboard a 1st Marine Aircraft Wing transport plane. She then sailed from Yokohama on October 22 aboard the SS Pacific Transport, due in San Francisco on November 5, 1954. A typhoon delayed the ship's arrival until the evening of November 9. Reckless and her caretakers stayed aboard until the next morning. Reckless got sick during the storm and was once knocked out of her stall onto the deck by the storm, which happened near the end of the trip. \n\nReckless's entry into the United States was not without its challenges. The Customs Bureau was not much of a problem but the United States Department of Agriculture insisted a medical check and lab tests be completed before she disembarked from the ship once it reached San Francisco, which would make her late for the Marine banquet where she was to be the guest of honor. The Marines contacted Agriculture Department officials in Washington, D.C. who agreed to allow her off the ship after her blood was drawn for lab tests, with the understanding that if she had glanders or dourine, she would be destroyed or sent back to Japan. Many of the Marines who actually knew her were incensed at what they considered an affront to her honor when they learned that dourine was an equine sexually transmitted disease. The night before she arrived, she once again ate her blanket, but a new one with ribbons and insignia was made just in time for her disembarkation. She was led off the ship by Lieutenant Pedersen and set foot on American soil in San Francisco on November 10, 1954, coincidentally the birthday of the  Marine Corps. For the Marine Corps Birthday Ball held that day, she rode an elevator, and then ate both cake and the flower decorations.\n\nReckless was kept by Pedersen's family for a brief time before moving to a more permanent home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.Reckless was well cared for and treated as a VIP during her time at Camp Pendleton. The Marine Corps was also careful not to allow her to be exploited by commercial interests. She produced four foals there: colts Fearless (1957), Dauntless (1959), and Chesty (1964); her last foal, a filly born circa 1965\u20131966, died a month after birth and was unnamed. Her offspring Chesty was named after Chesty Puller, one of the few Marines ever allowed to ride Reckless. Puller was a Marine Corps lieutenant general and the most decorated United States Marine of all time. Reckless retired from active service with full military honors at Camp Pendleton on November 10, 1960. She was provided free quarters and feed in lieu of retirement pay, per Marine Corps documents.\n\nReckless developed arthritis in her back as she aged and injured herself on May 13, 1968, by falling into a barbed wire fence. She died under sedation while her wounds were being treated. At the time of her death, she was estimated to be 19 or 20 years old. There is a plaque and photo commemorating her at the Camp Pendleton stables. The first race at Aqueduct racetrack, New York, was designated \"The Sgt Reckless\" on November 10, 1989. In 1997, Reckless was listed by LIFE magazine as one of America's 100 all-time heroes.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nA statue by sculptor Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition shells and other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, one day before the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her tail hair in the base of the statue. The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: \"The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, was something else to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted in my head and heart forever.\"A memorial to Sergeant Reckless at Camp Pendleton was dedicated on October 26, 2016.  The monument was created by Jocelyn Russell.  It is similar to the one located at the National Museum of the Marine Corps.A memorial to Sergeant Reckless at Yeoncheon Gorangpogu History Park (Near Battlefield of Outpost Vegas Battle) was dedicated in 2018\n\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\nSource:\n\n \nOn 28 July 2016, Sergeant Reckless was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal for her service between 1952 and 1953.In November 2019 she became one of the first recipients of the new American equivalent of the Dickin Medal, the Animals in War & Peace Medal of Bravery.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nReckless 1953: Horse Musical Show by Korea Racing Authority\nBrooklyn Nine Nine: Sergeant Peanut Butter from S01E13 is inspired by Reckless\n\n\n== See also ==\nHorses in warfare\nJudy (dog)\nWojtek (bear)\nUnsinkable Sam\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBarrett, Janet (2014).

        "wiki": "Kanazawa-ku (\u91d1\u6ca2\u533a) is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward had an estimated population of 209,565 and a density of 6,760 persons per km\u00b2. The total area was 31.01 km2 (11.97 sq mi). The ward symbol, established 1987, expresses the image of sea, waves, and a sea gull.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area around present-day Kanazawa Ward has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the J\u014dmon period at numerous locations in the area. Under the Nara period Ritsury\u014d system, it became part of Kuraki District in Musashi Province. By the Kamakura period it was part of a sh\u014den controlled by the H\u014dj\u014d clan, who established a major seaport for the Kamakura shogunate at Mutsuura, and a noted library and educational center at Kanazawa Bunko.\nDuring the Edo period, much of the area was part of the tenry\u014d territory in Musashi Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. In 1726, a large portion of the present ward came under the control of the newly established Mutsuura Domain ruled by the Yonekura clan.  The area consisted of small farming and fishing villages. During the Bakumatsu period, the area offshore Kanazawa was an anchorage for the American black ships under command of Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and 1854. After the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858, it was one of the first areas in Japan opened to foreign trade. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system following the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of Kuraki District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1887, It\u014d Hirobumi and a group of political scholars completed the final drafts of the Meiji Constitution while secluded in an inn in Kanazawa.  In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. The area was connected by rail to Yokohama with the opening of the Sh\u014dnan Electric Railway (the predecessor of the modern Keihin Electric Express Railway in 1930. In October 1936, Kuraki District was abolished, and the area was absorbed into Yokohama City, becoming part of Isogo Ward.  A large railway carriage factory was established in Kanazawa Ward in 1946 by the Tokyu Corporation on the site of a former Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Center. Kanazawa Ward gained its independence from Isogo Ward in May 1948.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKanazawa Ward is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and in the southeast corner of the city of Yokohama.

        "wiki": "Kawasaki (\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02, Kawasaki-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the 8th most populated city in Japan (including the Tokyo Metropolitan Area) and one of the main cities forming the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihin Industrial Area.As of October 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 1,503,690, with 716,470 households, and a population density of 10,000 persons per km2. Kawasaki is the only city in Japan with more than one million inhabitants that is not a prefectural capital. The total area is 142.70 km2 (55.10 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and Ancient era ===\nArchaeological evidence from the Japanese Paleolithic and J\u014dmon period can only be found in the northwest Tama Hills. The course of the Tama and the coast of the Bay of Tokyo have also changed in historical times, so that large parts of the urban area are geologically young.\n\n\n=== Classical era ===\n\n\n==== Nara period to the Sengoku period ====\nWith the introduction of the Ritsury\u014d legal system, the area came to the Musashi Province in the 7th century. In the Nara period, the center of the Tachibana district was probably in the area of today's Takatsu district. Since the Heian period, the domain of the Inage clan has expanded here. Around the Heiken-ji Buddhist temple (better known as Kawasaki-Daishi), founded in 1128, a monzen-machi, a busy district for the supply of pilgrims, soon emerged. Between the Kamakura period and Sengoku period, smaller feudal lords ruled the area until it finally came under the control of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan.\n\n\n=== Early Modern ===\nIn 1611, Koizumi Jiday\u016b had Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui built, a canal system on the right bank of the Tama for irrigating the fields, which in some cases still runs through the densely built-up city. On the long-distance Kaid\u014d roads T\u014dkaid\u014d and Nakaharakaid\u014d built by Edo-Bakufu, stations were built in the area of what would later become Kawasaki, which increased its importance. The Kawasaki station (Kawasaki-juku, near today's Kawasaki station) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d was not officially recognized until 1623 as the last of the 53 T\u014dkaid\u014d stations. The Bakufu let the bridges over the Tama collapse and there were ferry connections to nearby Edo in several places in today's Kawasaki, which laid the foundation for the development of the city.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nThe rapid urbanization of the area, which continues to this day, began in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras. In 1872, Kawasaki Station was established on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line which was Japan's first railway line. In 1889, the city (machi) Kawasaki in the district (gun) Tachibana was created according to the Japanese municipal system introduced the year before. In 1912 the border between Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures was established in the Tama. On July 1, 1924, the independent city (shi-) of Kawasaki with 48,394 inhabitants was formed through a merger with the city of Daishi (formerly Daishigawara) and the village of Miyuki.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAs part of World War II, the city was bombed three times by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between April 1945 and July 1945. The most serious attack was an area bombing with Napalm bombs on April 15, 1945. The attacks destroyed around 35% of the urban area and claimed 1,520 dead and 8,759 injured. The attacks burned down 9.3 km\u00b2 of the city (see Bombing of Tokyo).\n\n\n=== Contemporary period ===\n\n\n==== Sh\u014dwa era (1945\u20131989) ====\nOn April 15, 1945, large parts of the area around the train station and the industrial area at the port were destroyed by air raids. Since the 1950s, residential areas for commuters have been created in the northeastern part of the city, which are connected directly to the centers of Tokyo by new railway lines. On April 1, 1972, Kawasaki became a decree-designated city (seirei shitei toshi) with 5 districts. 1973 the population exceeded the million mark. In 1982 the new districts of Miyamae and Asao were created by splitting off from the districts of Takatsu and Tama. In the course of deindustrialization, industrial areas have recently been increasingly converted into residential areas (mostly Multi-family residential), so that a further increase in population density can be expected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nKawasaki is located on the right bank of the Tama River, which flows into the Tokyo Bay here. The city lies like a narrow band between Tokyo in the northeast and Yokohama in the southwest. The city connects the two major cities and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world.\nThe eastern area along the coast of Tokyo Bay is a densely populated industrial zone, part of the Keihin Industrial Zone. In contrast, the western districts in the Tama Hills consist largely of residential areas for commuters in the Tokyo / Yokohama region.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKawasaki has seven wards (ku):\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and towns ===\nIn the northeast, Kawasaki borders the Special wards of Tokyo (starting at Tokyo Bay) \u014cta and Setagaya, in the northwest the cities (-shi) belonging to Tokyo Prefecture (-shi) Komae, Chofu, Machida, Inagi, Tama enclose the place. The opposite southwest side is entirely occupied by the districts of Tsurumi, K\u014dhoku, Tsuzuki and Aoba in the city of Yokohama. With the completion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, the city of Kisarazu, located on the opposite side of the Tokyo Bay in Chiba Prefecture, also became a neighbor in December 1997.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nTwo rivers cross the urban area. The Tama unites with the tributaries Misawa, Yamashita, Gotanda, Nikary\u014d main river and Hirase; Katahira, Asao, Shimpukuji, Arima, E, Shibu and Yabumi flow into the Tsurumi.\nThe land on the coast of the city is crossed by a network of canals (Tama Canal, Suehiro Canal, Chidori Canal, Yak\u014d Canal, Daishi Canal, Mizue Canal, Shiohama Canal, Iriesaki Canal, Asano Canal, Ikegami Canal, Minami-Watarida Canal, Tanabe Canal, Shiraishi Canal and the Sakai Canal). In addition, the historic Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui canal still exists in the hinterland.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\nKawasaki is governed by Mayor Norihiko Fukuda, an independent elected on 27 October 2013. The city assembly has 63 elected members. Mayor Fukuda was re-elected to a second term in office on 22 October 2017 with support from LDP and K\u014dmeit\u014d against former municipal MP Akiko Yoshizawa and KPJ-supported former primary school teacher Hirokazu Ichiko.The 60-member city parliament of Kawasaki was re-elected in the unified elections in April 2019. The LDP remained the strongest with 19 seats.Kawasaki was in June 2008 the second Japanese \"government-designated city\" (seirei shitei toshi) after Hiroshima, which allowed foreigners to participate in municipal referendums.In the 105-member prefectural parliament of Kanagawa, the districts of Kawasaki used as constituencies together choose 18 deputies.For the House of Representatives (Japan), Kawasaki comprises the constituencies Kanagawa 9 (in the west), 10 (in the east) and 18 (in the middle). In the 2017 election, these went unchanged to Liberal Democrats Kazunori Tanaka and Daishir\u014d Yamagiwa and ex-Democrat Hirofumi Ry\u016b for the Kib\u014d no T\u014d (Party of Hope, later to the Mirai Nippon faction).\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2005 Kawasaki mayoral election\n\n\n=== List of Mayors of Kawasaki (from 1924) ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nKawasaki Stadium: Located in Kawasaki-ku.

        "wiki": "Mikasa (\u4e09\u7b20) is a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. Named after Mount Mikasa in Nara, Japan, the ship served as the flagship of Vice Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. Days after the end of the war, Mikasa's magazine accidentally exploded and sank the ship. She was salvaged and her repairs took over two years to complete. Afterwards, the ship served as a coast-defence ship during World War I and supported Japanese forces during the Siberian Intervention in the Russian Civil War.\nAfter 1922, Mikasa was decommissioned in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty and preserved as a museum ship at Yokosuka. She was badly neglected during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s. She has been partially restored, and is now a museum ship located at Mikasa Park in Yokosuka. Mikasa is the last remaining example of a pre-dreadnought battleship anywhere in the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nCombat experience in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the \u00a330,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.As with the earlier Fuji and Shikishima-class battleships, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. Mikasa, the last of these ships, was ordered from the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in 1898 at the cost of \u00a3880,000 (8.8 million yen at that time). Although she closely resembled several of the other ships ordered in this program, she was the only ship in her class.\n\n\n== Design and description ==\n\nThe design of Mikasa was a modified version of the Formidable-class battleships of the Royal Navy with two additional 6-inch (152 mm) guns. Mikasa had an overall length of 432 feet (131.7 m), a beam of 76 feet (23.2 m), and a normal draught of 27 feet 2 inches (8.3 m). She displaced 15,140 long tons (15,380 t) at normal load. The crew numbered about 830 officers and enlisted men.The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at 15,000 indicated horsepower (11,000 kW), using forced draught, and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) although Mikasa proved to be faster during her sea trials in December 1901, reaching 18.45 knots (34.17 km/h; 21.23 mph) from 16,341 indicated horsepower (12,185 kW). She carried a maximum of 2,000 tonnes (2,000 long tons) of coal which allowed her to steam for 9,000 nautical miles (17,000 km; 10,000 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).Mikasa's main battery consisted of the same four Elswick Ordnance Company 40-calibre twelve-inch guns used in all of the preceding Japanese battleships. They were mounted in twin-gun barbettes fore and aft of the superstructure that had armoured hoods to protect the guns and were usually called gun turrets. The hydraulically powered mountings could be loaded at all angles of traverse while the guns were loaded at a fixed angle of +13.5\u00b0. They fired 850-pound (386 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,400 ft/s (730 m/s).The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 40-calibre 6-inch (152 mm) quick-firing guns mounted in casemates. Ten of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other four guns were placed above them at the corners of the superstructure. They fired 100-pound (45 kg) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 ft/s (700 m/s). Protection against torpedo boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. The 12-pounders fired 3-inch (76 mm), 12.5-pound (5.7 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,359 ft/s (719 m/s). Lighter guns consisted of eight 47-millimetre (1.9 in) three-pounder Hotchkiss guns and eight 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The three-pounder gun fired 3.19-pound (1.45 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 1,927 ft/s (587 m/s) while the 2.5-pounder fired 2.5-pound (1.1 kg) shells at a muzzle velocity of 1,420 ft/s (430 m/s). The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes, two on each broadside.The waterline armour belt of Mikasa consisted of Krupp cemented armour that had a maximum thickness of 9 inches (229 mm) over the middle of the ship. It was only 4 inches (102 mm) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch strake of armour that ran between the barbettes. The barbettes were 14 inches (356 mm) thick, but reduced to six inches at the level of the lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a thickness of 8\u201310 inches (203\u2013254 mm). The casemates protecting the secondary armament were 2\u20136 inches (51\u2013152 mm) thick and the deck armour was 2\u20133 inches (51\u201376 mm) in thickness. The forward conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour, but the aft conning tower only had four inches of armour.Mikasa, like all the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four Barr & Stroud FA3 coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of 7,300 metres (8,000 yd). In addition the ships were also fitted with 24-power magnification telescopic gunsights.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\n\nMikasa, named after Mount Mikasa, was laid down by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 24 January 1899. She was launched on 8 November 1900 and completed on 1 March 1902. After a visit to Devonport, she left Plymouth on 13 March, bound for Yokohama, under the command of Captain Hayasaki.At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Mikasa, commanded by Captain Hikojir\u014d Ijichi, was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. T\u014dg\u014d had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and expected to find them badly disorganized and weakened, but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser Boyarin which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. T\u014dg\u014d chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese 8-inch (203 mm) and six-inch guns inflicted very little significant damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although a large number of ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only 17 while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before T\u014dg\u014d disengaged. Mikasa was hit by two ten-inch shells during the engagement that wounded seven crewmen.The ship participated in the action of 13 April when T\u014dg\u014d successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship Petropavlovsk. When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T\u014dg\u014d resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields which sank two Japanese battleships the following month.During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, Mikasa was at the head of the column of Japanese battleships and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was hit twenty times, two of which knocked out her aft 12-inch gun turret, and suffered 125 casualties among her crew. In turn, she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships Poltava and Tsesarevich although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact.\n\n\n=== Battle of Tsushima ===\n\nAt the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, Mikasa again led the 1st Fleet into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons detached from the Baltic Fleet. The ship opened fire at the battleship Knyaz Suvorov, the Russian flagship, at 14:10, and was joined by the battleship Asahi and the armoured cruiser Azuma shortly afterwards. Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, knocked out her rear twelve-inch gun turret, and jammed Knyaz Suvorov's steering so that she fell out of formation. During this time, Mikasa was the focus of the Russian fire as the leading ship in the Japanese column and was hit by 6 twelve-inch and 19 six-inch shells. They did very little damage and T\u014dg\u014d was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. Knyaz Suvorov's steering was later repaired, but she blundered between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and Mikasa fired three torpedoes at her to no avail. Later in the battle, the ship appears to have fired mostly on the battleship Borodino although Fuji fired the shots that caused the Russian ship's magazines to explode and sink her. At 18:04, a twelve-inch shell detonated prematurely in the barrel of the right gun of the forward turret, disabling the gun and knocking out the left gun until 18:40. Another twelve-inch shell had exploded in that same barrel almost two hours earlier, but had not damaged the gun. One six-inch gun jammed after firing 19 rounds, but the only other damage to any of the ship's guns was one six-inch gun that was disabled by a Russian shell of the same size that entered through the gunport. She fired 124 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship except Asahi's 142. In total, Mikasa was hit more than 40 times during the battle, including 10 twelve-inch and 22 six-inch shells, but none of them seriously damaged her. While Mikasa's casualties are not precisely known, the entire Japanese force combined only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle.\n\nSix days after the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war was signed, Mikasa sank at her moorings after a fire and magazine explosion at Sasebo on the night of 11/12 September 1905 that killed 251 crewmen. She was refloated on 7 August 1906, reconstructed and repaired at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her existing armament with more powerful 45-calibre twelve-inch and six-inch guns during the two years it took to repair the ship. Mikasa was restored to active service on 24 August 1908. During World War I, she served on coast-defence duties, based at Maizuru, during 1914\u201315 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, for the rest of the war. The ship supported the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War during 1921 and was reclassified on 1 September 1921 as a first-class coast-defence ship. On 17 September, Mikasa ran aground near Askold Island off Vladivostok, but was not seriously damaged.\n\n\n=== Preservation ===\n\nThe ship was decommissioned on 23 September 1923 following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and scheduled for destruction. However, at the request of the Japanese government, each of the signatory countries to the treaty agreed that Mikasa could be preserved as a memorial ship with her hull encased in concrete. On 12 November 1926, Mikasa was opened for display in Yokosuka in the presence of Crown Prince Hirohito and T\u014dg\u014d. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the ship deteriorated under control of the occupation forces. In 1955, Philadelphia businessman John Rubin, formerly of Barrow, England, wrote a letter to the Japan Times about the state of the ship, which was the catalyst for a new restoration campaign. With the support of the Japanese public, and also Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the restored battleship reopened in 1961. On 5 August 2009, Mikasa was repainted by sailors from USS Nimitz.Mikasa is remembered in Barrow-in-Furness, the town of its construction, by Mikasa Street on Walney Island.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRussian cruiser Aurora, a surviving Russian warship of the Battle of Tsushima\nUSS Olympia, a U.S. Navy protected cruiser preserved in Philadelphia\nUSS Texas, sole surviving dreadnought battleship\nGreek cruiser Georgios Averof, the only armored cruiser still afloat\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrook, Peter (1999).

        "wiki": "Chinese people in Japan include any people self-identifying as ethnic Chinese or people possessing Chinese citizenship living in Japan. People aged 22 or older cannot possess dual-citizenship in Japan, so Chinese possessing Japanese citizenship typically no longer possess Chinese citizenship. The term \"Chinese people\" typically refers to the Han Chinese, the main ethnic group living in China (PRC) (including Hong Kong and Macau SARs), Taiwan (ROC) and Singapore. Officially, China (PRC) is home to 55 additional ethnic minorities, including people such as Tibetans, though these people might not self-identify as Chinese. Han Chinese people have had a long history in Japan as a minority.\n\n\n== Population and distribution ==\nMost Chinese people, or descendants of Chinese immigrants, who are living in Japan reside in major cities such as Osaka, Yokohama, and Tokyo, although there are increasingly also significant populations in other areas as government immigration policies increasingly attract workers to 'training programs', universities seek increasing numbers of international students and Chinese people see business opportunities. Japan's first recognised Chinatown was in Nagasaki, developing in the 1680s when economic prerogatives meant that the Shogunal government needed to restrict and control trade to a greater extent than previously. Before this, there had been a large number of Chinese communities in the west of the country, made up of pirates, merchants and also people who fitted into both categories. In the 19th century, the well-known Chinatowns of Yokohama and Kobe developed, and they are still thriving today, although the majority of Chinese people in Japan live outside Chinatowns in the regular community. The communities are served by Chinese schools that teach the Chinese language, and a small but increasing number of Japanese people study Chinese in both public schools and private academies.\nThe Chinese community has undergone a dramatic change since the PRC allowed more freedom of movement of its citizens, but citizens of Taiwan (ROC), Singapore and Hong Kong nationality are not counted in these figures. A study that was conducted in 1995 estimated that the Chinese population of Japan numbered 150,000, among whom between 50,000 and 100,000 could speak Chinese. In 2000, Japanese governmental statistics revealed that there were 335,575 Chinese people in Japan. Current demographic statistics reveal that these numbers have reached over 600,000 legal immigrants, although there is probably also a significant population, although of unknown number, of undocumented immigrants. A significant number of Chinese people take Japanese citizenship each year and therefore disappear from these figures. As Japanese citizenship, like France, does not record ethnicity, once a person has naturalised, they are simply Japanese, so the category of Chinese-Japanese does not exist in the same way as it would in a country which recognises ethnicity. Therefore, the numbers of Japanese people who are of Chinese descent is unclear.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-modern era ===\nIt is believed that a substantial component of the Yayoi people migrated from China to Japan. The Yayoi people who introduced wet rice cultivation to Japan may have come from Jiangnan near the Yangtze River Delta in ancient China. This is supported by archeological research and bones found in modern southeastern China and western Japan. According to several Japanese historians, the Yayoi and their ancestors, the Wajin, originated in the today Yunnan province in southern China. Suwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku (Wajin) to be part of the Baiyue (\u767e\u8d8a). It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (today ~36%), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3) (today ~23%) and Haplogroup O-M119 (O1) (today ~4%), which are typical for East- and Southeast-Asians. Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, and O1 are one of the carriers of Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined, several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. It is suggested that the linguistic homeland of Japonic is located somewhere in south-eastern or eastern China before the proto-Japanese migrated to the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. According to linguist, Alexander Vovin, the urheimat of the Japonic languages may have been located in Southern China. Japanese linguist, Miyamoto Kazuo, instead has suggested a homeland further north in China, around modern day Beijing and Liaoning.Ambassadorial visits to Japan by the later Chinese dynasties Wei and Jin recorded that the Wajin of Japan claimed to be descendants of Taibo of Wu, traditionally believed to be the founder of Wu. Several scholars in Japan suggested that the Yamato people and the Imperial House of Japan are descendants of the Wu and possibly Taibo. Many Japanese historians also link the early Japanese Yayoi people to the Baiyue tribes that also include the Wu people.A Chinese legend of uncertain provenance states that Xu Fu, a Qin Dynasty court sorcerer, was sent by Qin Shi Huang to Penglai Mountain (Mount Fuji) in 219 BC to retrieve an elixir of life. Xu could not find any elixir of life and was reluctant to return to China because he knew he would be sentenced to death, Xu instead stayed in Japan. Other immigrants are also thought to include major population movements such as that of the Hata clan. The Hata clan claimed to be the descendants of Qin Shi Huang.\nIn 499 CE, a Chinese Buddhist missionary Hui Shen, paid visit to an island east of China known as Fusang, typically identified with modern-day Japan, which was described in the 7th-century Liang Shu.\nAccording to the Shinsen Sh\u014djiroku (815), 176 Chinese aristocratic families lived in the Kinai area of Honshu, around the modern-day Kansai region. These immigrant clans were referred to as Toraijin (\u6e21\u6765\u4eba).During the Mongol invasions of China, many Chinese refugees fled to Japan. Some of these Chinese refugees became immensely powerful, for example, Mugaku Sogen, a Chinese Zen Buddhist who fled to Japan after the fall of the Song dynasty. After fleeing Japan, Mugaku Sogen became an advisor to the then ruler of Japan, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune.  The Chinese refugees who fled the Mongols warned the Japanese that the Mongols would also intend to invade Japan. Mugaku Sogen gave a bad report to Tokimune about the barbarity and cruelty of the Mongols after witnessing Mongol soldiers killing his fellow monks at a monastery. This encouraged Tokimune to not pay tribute to the Mongols as the emissaries Kublai Khan sent to Japan demanded, and instead resist the Mongols in their later attempted invasions of Japan. During the second Mongol invasion of Japan, many Chinese soldiers landed in Japan. After the Mongol defeat, the Japanese defenders killed all the Koreans, Mongols, and Jurchen soldiers they found, except for the Southern Chinese, who the Japanese felt had been coerced by the Mongols into joining the attack on Japan.  The Southern Chinese soldiers were spared from being killed by the Japanese, but instead forced to become slaves. During the Ming dynasty, Japan became decentralized without a central government and with many local daimyo reigning the country, in what would be called the Sengoku Period. Many of these daimyo encouraged Chinese immigration to Japan due to their skills and boost to the local economy. Many Chinese communities would be established in Japan, especially on the island of Kyushu. Many Chinese pirates would set up their bases in Japan in order to launch raid and attacks on mainland China as part of the wokou. For example, the powerful Chinese pirate, Wang Zhi, who became known as the \"king of the wokou\", established his base of operation in Japanese islands, in order to launch raids against the Ming government. Many of the Chinese pirates were supported by Japanese daimyo themselves.Chinese people are also known to have settled in Okinawa during the Sanzan period at the invitation of the Ryukyuan kings; these were high level royal advisors who lived in the village of Kumemura, for example, claim to all be descended from Chinese immigrants.During the Manchu conquest of China, many Chinese refugees would again flee to Japan to escape Manchu rule. For example, the Chinese scholar, Zhu Zhiyu, was one of the greatest scholars of Confucianism in the Ming dynasty and Edo Japan. Zhu remains the best remembered of the Ming political refugees in Tokugawa Japan and the one who contributed most to Japanese education and intellectual history.One of the most well-known Chinese folk heroes was the Ming loyalist Koxinga, who conquered the island of Taiwan from the hands of the Dutch, in order to establish the Tungning Kingdom, the last remnant of the fallen Ming dynasty, where he could continue to fight against the Manchu invaders of China. Despite being a Chinese folk hero, Koxinga was actually born in Japan, to a Chinese merchant father and a Japanese mother. Koxinga is still worshiped as a folk deity, especially in Fujian and Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nDuring the Meiji and Taisho eras, it is estimated that up to 100 000 Chinese students came to study in Japan. Japan was both closer to China culturally and in distance than the American and European alternatives. It was also much cheaper. In 1906 alone, more than six thousand Chinese students were in Japan. Most of them resided in the district of Kanda in Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\nThe term shin-kaky\u014d refers to people of Chinese descent who immigrated to Japan from Taiwan and mainland China.\n\n\n== Groups ==\n\n\n=== Foreign students ===\n\nMany famous Chinese intellectuals and political figures have studied in Japan, among them Sun Yat-sen, Zhou Zuoren, Lu Xun, Zhou Enlai and Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n=== Workers ===\nThe industrial 'training scheme' used to bring Chinese workers to Japan has been criticized by lawyers as exploitation, after several deaths.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nMany Japanese war orphans left behind in China after World War II have migrated to Japan with the assistance of the Japanese government, bringing along their Chinese spouses and children.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nChinese restaurants in Japan serve a fairly distinct style of Chinese cuisine. Though in the past Chinese cuisine would have been primarily available in Chinatowns such as those in port cities of Kobe, Nagasaki, or Yokohama, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is now commonly available all over Japan. As Japanese restaurants often specialise in just one sort of dish, cuisine is focused primarily on dishes found within three distinct types of restaurants: ramen restaurants, dim sum houses, and standard Chinese-style restaurants.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2008 there are five Chinese day schools in Japan: two in Yokohama and one each in Kobe, Osaka, and Tokyo. Three are oriented towards the Republic of China on Taiwan while two are oriented towards mainland China. In Japanese the PRC-oriented schools are called tairiku-kei, and the ROC-oriented schools are taiwan-kei. The ROC-oriented schools teach Traditional Chinese and Bopomofo while the mainland-oriented schools teach Simplified Chinese and Hanyu Pinyin. The ROC-oriented schools, by 2008, also began teaching Simplified Chinese.As of 1995 most teachers at these schools are ethnic Chinese persons who were born in Japan. By that year there were increasing numbers of Japanese families sending their children to Chinese schools. Other students at Chinese schools are Japanese with mixed Chinese-Japanese parentage, Japanese children with Chinese parents, and returnees from abroad.\n\nSun Yat-sen established the Yokohama Chinese School in 1898. In 1952 it split into the mainland-aligned Yokohama Yamate Chinese School and the ROC-aligned Yokohama Overseas Chinese School. The Kobe Chinese School is also oriented towards mainland China. The Osaka Chinese School is located in Naniwa-ku, Osaka. There is also the Tokyo Chinese School.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Ch\u016bnichi Shinpo, a biweekly paper, is published in Chinese and Japanese. The Ch\u016bbun and Zhongwen Dabao, both weekly newspapers, and about 28 other Chinese newspapers are published in Tokyo. In addition the Kansai Kabun Jih\u014d, published in Chinese and Japanese, is based in the Osaka area.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Ethnic relations ===\nDuring his time in office, former Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara publicly used controversial terms such as sangokujin to refer to Taiwanese Benshengren staying illegally in Japan, and implied that they might engage in rioting and looting in the aftermath of a disaster.\nI referred to the \"many sangokujin who entered Japan illegally.\" I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used gaikokujin, or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.\n... After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.\n\n... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nThis is a list of Chinese expatriates in Japan and Japanese citizens of Chinese descent.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nChen Kenmin, chef regarded as the \"father of Sichuan cuisine\" in Japan and father of Chen Kenichi\nGo Seigen, professional Go player\nSun Yat-sen, politician\nLu Xun, writer\nQiu Jin, feminist\nShosei Go, professional baseball player\nChiang Kai-shek, politician and general\nSong Jiaoren, revolutionary and political figure, founder of Tongmenghui\nJiang Baili, general\nGuo Moruo, poet and political figure\nHe Yingqin, general\nWang Jingwei, revolutionary and political figure\nDai Jitao, political figure\nChen Duxiu, co-founder of Chinese Communist Party\nLi Dazhao, co-founder of Chinese Communist Party\nZhou Zuoren, writer\nHuang Fu, general and politician\nChen Qimei, revolutionary\nZhou Enlai, politician\n\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\nMomofuku Ando, founder of Nissin Foods, with Japanese Formosa origins and ROC citizenship.\nChen Kenmin, Sichuan-born Sichuan-style chef in Japan\nChen Kenichi, son of Chen Kenmin, also a Sichuan-style chef and longest-serving participant on Japanese cooking show Iron Chef\nChire Koyama, table tennis player, formerly known as He Zhili\nAgnes Chan, pop singer, professor, and writer\nLou Zhenggang, artist\nLee Teng-hui, politician\nRissei \u014c, professional Go player\nO Meien, professional Go player\nSadaharu Oh, professional baseball player\nRin Kaiho, professional Go player\nCho U, professional Go player\nChin Shunshin, novelist\nJudy Ongg, actress, singer, author, and woodblock-print artist\nTeresa Teng, Taiwanese (ROC) pop singer\nYinling, swimsuit model, race queen, singer and former professional wrestler\nKimiko Yo, award-winning Japanese actress of Republic of China nationality\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nMo Bangfu, author\nEmi Suzuki, female model (immigrant)\nKaito Nakahori, composer (1/2 Chinese, 1/2 Japanese)\nWei Son, female model (immigrant)\nLeena, female model (immigrant)\nQian Lin & Li Chun, singers\nRola Chen, gravure idol\nZheng Yongshan, murderer\nJian Kabe, con artist\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment in China\nAnti-Chinese sentiment in Japan\nChinatown\nChinatowns in Asia\nYokohama Chinatown\nKobe Chinatown\nNagasaki Chinatown\nIkebukuro Chinatown\nKoreans in Japan\nKumemura\nJapanese orphans in China\nJapanese people in China\nAinu people\nRyukyuans\nYamato people\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJansen, Marius B.

        "wiki": "Kawasaki (\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02, Kawasaki-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the 8th most populated city in Japan (including the Tokyo Metropolitan Area) and one of the main cities forming the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihin Industrial Area.As of October 1, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 1,503,690, with 716,470 households, and a population density of 10,000 persons per km2. Kawasaki is the only city in Japan with more than one million inhabitants that is not a prefectural capital. The total area is 142.70 km2 (55.10 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric and Ancient era ===\nArchaeological evidence from the Japanese Paleolithic and J\u014dmon period can only be found in the northwest Tama Hills. The course of the Tama and the coast of the Bay of Tokyo have also changed in historical times, so that large parts of the urban area are geologically young.\n\n\n=== Classical era ===\n\n\n==== Nara period to the Sengoku period ====\nWith the introduction of the Ritsury\u014d legal system, the area came to the Musashi Province in the 7th century. In the Nara period, the center of the Tachibana district was probably in the area of today's Takatsu district. Since the Heian period, the domain of the Inage clan has expanded here. Around the Heiken-ji Buddhist temple (better known as Kawasaki-Daishi), founded in 1128, a monzen-machi, a busy district for the supply of pilgrims, soon emerged. Between the Kamakura period and Sengoku period, smaller feudal lords ruled the area until it finally came under the control of the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan.\n\n\n=== Early Modern ===\nIn 1611, Koizumi Jiday\u016b had Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui built, a canal system on the right bank of the Tama for irrigating the fields, which in some cases still runs through the densely built-up city. On the long-distance Kaid\u014d roads T\u014dkaid\u014d and Nakaharakaid\u014d built by Edo-Bakufu, stations were built in the area of what would later become Kawasaki, which increased its importance. The Kawasaki station (Kawasaki-juku, near today's Kawasaki station) on the T\u014dkaid\u014d was not officially recognized until 1623 as the last of the 53 T\u014dkaid\u014d stations. The Bakufu let the bridges over the Tama collapse and there were ferry connections to nearby Edo in several places in today's Kawasaki, which laid the foundation for the development of the city.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nThe rapid urbanization of the area, which continues to this day, began in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras. In 1872, Kawasaki Station was established on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line which was Japan's first railway line. In 1889, the city (machi) Kawasaki in the district (gun) Tachibana was created according to the Japanese municipal system introduced the year before. In 1912 the border between Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures was established in the Tama. On July 1, 1924, the independent city (shi-) of Kawasaki with 48,394 inhabitants was formed through a merger with the city of Daishi (formerly Daishigawara) and the village of Miyuki.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAs part of World War II, the city was bombed three times by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between April 1945 and July 1945. The most serious attack was an area bombing with Napalm bombs on April 15, 1945. The attacks destroyed around 35% of the urban area and claimed 1,520 dead and 8,759 injured. The attacks burned down 9.3 km\u00b2 of the city (see Bombing of Tokyo).\n\n\n=== Contemporary period ===\n\n\n==== Sh\u014dwa era (1945\u20131989) ====\nOn April 15, 1945, large parts of the area around the train station and the industrial area at the port were destroyed by air raids. Since the 1950s, residential areas for commuters have been created in the northeastern part of the city, which are connected directly to the centers of Tokyo by new railway lines. On April 1, 1972, Kawasaki became a decree-designated city (seirei shitei toshi) with 5 districts. 1973 the population exceeded the million mark. In 1982 the new districts of Miyamae and Asao were created by splitting off from the districts of Takatsu and Tama. In the course of deindustrialization, industrial areas have recently been increasingly converted into residential areas (mostly Multi-family residential), so that a further increase in population density can be expected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nKawasaki is located on the right bank of the Tama River, which flows into the Tokyo Bay here. The city lies like a narrow band between Tokyo in the northeast and Yokohama in the southwest. The city connects the two major cities and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world.\nThe eastern area along the coast of Tokyo Bay is a densely populated industrial zone, part of the Keihin Industrial Zone. In contrast, the western districts in the Tama Hills consist largely of residential areas for commuters in the Tokyo / Yokohama region.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKawasaki has seven wards (ku):\n\n\n=== Adjacent cities and towns ===\nIn the northeast, Kawasaki borders the Special wards of Tokyo (starting at Tokyo Bay) \u014cta and Setagaya, in the northwest the cities (-shi) belonging to Tokyo Prefecture (-shi) Komae, Chofu, Machida, Inagi, Tama enclose the place. The opposite southwest side is entirely occupied by the districts of Tsurumi, K\u014dhoku, Tsuzuki and Aoba in the city of Yokohama. With the completion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, the city of Kisarazu, located on the opposite side of the Tokyo Bay in Chiba Prefecture, also became a neighbor in December 1997.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nTwo rivers cross the urban area. The Tama unites with the tributaries Misawa, Yamashita, Gotanda, Nikary\u014d main river and Hirase; Katahira, Asao, Shimpukuji, Arima, E, Shibu and Yabumi flow into the Tsurumi.\nThe land on the coast of the city is crossed by a network of canals (Tama Canal, Suehiro Canal, Chidori Canal, Yak\u014d Canal, Daishi Canal, Mizue Canal, Shiohama Canal, Iriesaki Canal, Asano Canal, Ikegami Canal, Minami-Watarida Canal, Tanabe Canal, Shiraishi Canal and the Sakai Canal). In addition, the historic Nikary\u014d Y\u014dsui canal still exists in the hinterland.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\nKawasaki is governed by Mayor Norihiko Fukuda, an independent elected on 27 October 2013. The city assembly has 63 elected members. Mayor Fukuda was re-elected to a second term in office on 22 October 2017 with support from LDP and K\u014dmeit\u014d against former municipal MP Akiko Yoshizawa and KPJ-supported former primary school teacher Hirokazu Ichiko.The 60-member city parliament of Kawasaki was re-elected in the unified elections in April 2019. The LDP remained the strongest with 19 seats.Kawasaki was in June 2008 the second Japanese \"government-designated city\" (seirei shitei toshi) after Hiroshima, which allowed foreigners to participate in municipal referendums.In the 105-member prefectural parliament of Kanagawa, the districts of Kawasaki used as constituencies together choose 18 deputies.For the House of Representatives (Japan), Kawasaki comprises the constituencies Kanagawa 9 (in the west), 10 (in the east) and 18 (in the middle). In the 2017 election, these went unchanged to Liberal Democrats Kazunori Tanaka and Daishir\u014d Yamagiwa and ex-Democrat Hirofumi Ry\u016b for the Kib\u014d no T\u014d (Party of Hope, later to the Mirai Nippon faction).\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2005 Kawasaki mayoral election\n\n\n=== List of Mayors of Kawasaki (from 1924) ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nKawasaki Stadium: Located in Kawasaki-ku.

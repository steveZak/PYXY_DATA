        "wiki": "The Potala Palace is a dzong fortress in the city of Lhasa, in Tibet. It was the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas from 1649 to 1959, has been a museum since then, and is a World Heritage Site since 1994.\nThe palace is named after Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. The 5th Dalai Lama started its construction in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. It may overlay the remains of an earlier fortress called the White or Red Palace on the site, built by Songtsen Gampo in 637.The building measures 400 metres (1,300 ft) east-west and 350 metres (1,150 ft) north-south, with sloping stone walls averaging 3 metres (9.8 ft) thick, and 5 metres (16 ft) thick at the base, and with copper poured into the foundations to help proof it against earthquakes. Thirteen storeys of buildings, containing over 1,000 rooms, 10,000 shrines and about 200,000 statues, soar 117 metres (384 ft) on top of Marpo Ri, the \"Red Hill\", rising more than 300 metres (980 ft) in total above the valley floor.Tradition has it that the three main hills of Lhasa represent the \"Three Protectors of Tibet\". Chokpori, just to the south of the Potala, is the soul-mountain (Wylie: bla ri) of Vajrapani, Pongwari that of Manjusri, and Marpori, the hill on which the Potala stands, represents Avalokite\u015bvara.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe site on which the Potala Palace rises is built over a palace erected by Songtsen Gampo on the Red Hill. The Potala contains two chapels on its northwest corner that conserve parts of the original building. One is the Phakpa Lhakhang, the other the Chogyel Drupuk, a recessed cavern identified as Songtsen Gampo's meditation cave. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the modern Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The external structure was built in 3 years, while the interior, together with its furnishings, took 45 years to complete. The Dalai Lama and his government moved into the Potrang Karpo ('White Palace') in 1649. Construction lasted until 1694, some twelve years after his death. The Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time. The Potrang Marpo ('Red Palace') was added between 1690 and 1694.The new palace got its name from a hill on Cape Comorin at the southern tip of India\u2014a rocky point sacred to the bodhisattva of compassion, who is known as Avalokitesvara, or Chenrezi. The Tibetans themselves rarely speak of the sacred place as the \"Potala\", but rather as \"Peak Potala\" (Tse Potala), or most commonly as \"the Peak\".The palace was moderately damaged during the Tibetan uprising against the Chinese in 1959, when Chinese shells were launched into the palace's windows. Before Chamdo Jampa Kalden was shot and taken prisoner by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, he witnessed \"Chinese cannon shells began landing on Norbulingka past midnight on March 19th, 1959... The sky lit up as the Chinese shells hit the Chakpori Medical College and the Potala.\" It also escaped damage during the Cultural Revolution in 1966 through the personal intervention of Zhou Enlai, who was then the Premier of the People's Republic of China. Tibetan activist Tsering Woeser claims that the palace, which harboured \"over 100,000 volumes of scriptures and historical documents\" and \"many store rooms for housing precious objects, handicrafts, paintings, wall hangings, statues, and ancient armour\", \"was almost robbed empty\". On the other hand, tibetologist Amy Heller writes that \"the invaluable library and artistic treasures accumulated over the centuries in the Potala have been preserved.\"The Potala Palace was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. In 2000 and 2001, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka were added to the list as extensions to the sites. Rapid modernisation has been a concern for UNESCO, however, which expressed concern over the building of modern structures immediately around the palace which threaten the palace's unique atmosphere. The Chinese government responded by enacting a rule barring the building of any structure taller than 21 metres in the area. UNESCO was also concerned over the materials used during the restoration of the palace, which commenced in 2002 at a cost of RMB180 million (US$22.5 million), although the palace's director, Qiangba Gesang, has clarified that only traditional materials and craftsmanship were used. The palace has also received restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million).\nThe number of visitors to the palace was restricted to 1,600 a day, with opening hours reduced to six hours daily to avoid over-crowding from 1 May 2003. The palace was receiving an average of 1,500 a day prior to the introduction of the quota, sometimes peaking to over 5,000 in one day. Visits to the structure's roof were banned after restoration efforts were completed in 2006 to avoid further structural damage. Visitorship quotas were raised to 2,300 daily to accommodate a 30% increase in visitorship since the opening of the Qingzang railway into Lhasa on 1 July 2006, but the quota is often reached by mid-morning. Opening hours were extended during the peak period in the months of July to September, where over 6,000 visitors would descend on the site.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nBuilt at an altitude of 3,700 m (12,100 ft), on the side of Ri Marpo ('Red Mountain') in the centre of Lhasa Valley, the Potala Palace, with its vast inward-sloping walls broken only in the upper parts by straight rows of many windows, and its flat roofs at various levels, is not unlike a fortress in appearance. At the south base of the rock is a large space enclosed by walls and gates, with great porticos on the inner side. A series of tolerably easy staircases, broken by intervals of gentle ascent, leads to the summit of the rock. The whole width of this is occupied by the palace.\nThe central part of this group of buildings rises in a vast quadrangular mass above its satellites to a great height, terminating in gilt canopies similar to those on the Jokhang. This central member of Potala is called the \"red palace\" from its crimson colour, which distinguishes it from the rest. It contains the principal halls and chapels and shrines of past Dalai Lamas. There is in these much rich decorative painting, with jewelled work, carving and other ornamentation.\nThe lower white frontage on the south side of the palace was used to hoist two gigantic thangkas joined together representing the figures of Tara and Sakyamuni during the Sertreng Festival on the 30th day of the second Tibetan month.The Chinese Putuo Zongcheng Temple, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, built between 1767 and 1771, was in part modelled after the Potala Palace. The palace was named by the American television show Good Morning America and newspaper USA Today as one of the \"New Seven Wonders\".The nine storey Leh Palace in Leh, Ladakh, India built by King Sengge Namgyal (c. 1570\u20131642), was a precursor of the Potala Palace.\n\n\n== The Lhasa Zhol Pillars ==\n\nLhasa Zhol Village has two stone pillars or rdo-rings, an interior stone pillar or doring nangma, which stands within the village fortification walls, and the exterior stone pillar or doring chima, which originally stood outside the South entrance to the village. Today the pillar stands neglected to the East of the Liberation Square, on the South side of Beijing Avenue.\nThe doring chima dates as far back as circa 764, \"or only a little later\", and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing.The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in 763 during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNorbulingka, the Dalai Lama's former summer palace\nJokhang Temple Monastery\nDhvaja\nKundun, a 1997 film about the Dalai Lama, chiefly set inside the palace\nSeven Years in Tibet\nLeh Palace\nMount Putuo\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

It is situated atop Mar-po-ri (Red Mountain), 425 feet (130 metres) above the Lhasa River valley, and rises up dramatically from its rocky base. Potrang Karpo (completed 1648; White Palace) once served as the seat of the Tibetan government and the main residence of the Dalai Lama; from the mid-18th century it was used as a winter palace. Potrang Marpo (1694; Red Palace) houses several chapels, sacred statues, and the tombs of eight Dalai Lamas; it remains a major pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists.Potala Palace complexPotala Palace complex, Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.Adam Crowley/Getty ImagesPotala PalaceEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.Potrang KarpoPotrang Karpo (White Palace) within the Potala Palace complex, Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Potala PalacePotala Palace, Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Buddhist prayer wheelBuddhist prayer wheels at the base of the Potala Palace, Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nExploring China: Fact or Fiction?\nNorth China and South China are separated by a tall mountain range.\n\n\n\nKing Srong-brtsan-sgam-po commissioned the building of a palace in Lhasa in the 7th century. Significantly smaller and less elaborate than its 5-square-mile (13-square-km) successor, it was named the Potala (\u201cPure Land\u201d or \u201cHigh Heavenly Realm\u201d) for reasons that are not historically documented, although Mount Potala in India seems the likely source.

Lhasa was again chosen as the location because of its importance as a pilgrimage site and its proximity to the three main Buddhist monasteries of Sera, \u2019Bras-spungs (Drepung), and Dga\u2019-Idan (Ganden). The new Potala was built on Mar-po-ri for the security provided by an elevated position; until its use declined in the mid-18th century, the Potala was a major Tibetan military fortress.Lhasa, Tibet, China: Potala PalacePotala Palace, a popular pilgrimage destination for Tibetan Buddhists, in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China.CQYoung\u2014iStock/ThinkstockOf more than 1,000 rooms in the Potala, the ones considered most holy are the Chogyal Drubphuk and the Phakpa Lhakhang, remnants from the original palace of Srong-brtsan-sgam-po; the latter houses the sacred Arya Lokeshvara (Avalokiteshvara) statue. More than 200,000 statues and 10,000 altars are located within the sacred complex.

          "A must visit when in Lhasa. Beautiful both on the outside and inside. Due to the high altitude, try not to visit immediately after arriving into Lhasa as there's a lot of climbing involved and hence it is best to climatise. For those suffering from altitude sickness, there are",
          "Even if you are suffering from slight altitude sickness this place is not to be missed. We bought some oxygen water at the entrance, a gimmick I\u2019m sure, but I had a little altitude sickness and still made it to the top. So happy I did. Wow, really amazing. Surreal feeling that",
          "We visited in November and there were no lines. We were told that during high season the wait can be endless. Arrive early!",

          "Throngs of photographers out at night and in the early morning, trying to take the best photos possible. Our tour visit was excellent.",
          "Potala Palace the winter palace of Dalai Lamas 1649 -1959 and now a museum and world heritage site. Go early as it is very busy, fortunately I went in winter and it was busy with pilgrims but not tourists so just bearable. Cannot bring in liquids so hydrate before you start as",

          "Word of caution. Walking up all those steps at that altitude can be an issue. Half of our group either decided not to try or turned back while trying. And that is not all. There is a LOT of incense burned on the grounds inside the Potala. You are having breathing problems and on",
          "This place is amazing and climbing and descending 530 steps is a bit of a challenge. You are only allowed one hour from entry to exit, so a tour guide is needed to point out and explain the many features about Buddha and Buddhism for one to get any understanding of the many",

          "This is difficult to review because its been on my list to see for a long time but over the years the Chinese government has turned Potala Palace into a money maker for them and have successfully remove much of the Tibetan spiritual aspect of the visit. It is an amazing place,",

          "Still speechless, the most is told and written before about this palace. It's the biggest attraction in Tibet and a \"must visit\" while staying in Lhasa. Perhaps the authorities are overly concerned for security and personal control, - maybe we just have to live with this \"big",

          "This must be one of the top sites in the world, full of character and history. It cannot be missed. If you visit in peak season, you'll only have an hour to visit (and your guide will ensure that you are out in time - or they lose their permit to visit). It is busy and feel",

          "Simply an amazing and unforgettable Palace. You begin with a huge climb that is sure to leave you breathless at times. Easy does it as the payoff is worth it. Home to the 5th-14th Dali Lamas the palace oozes history. Marvel at the height and construction. Be inspired by the",
          "We visited the Palace with our tour party and it was just incredible. The rich heritage and history of the Palace is amazing and we were lucky to have a very knowledgeable tour guide too. You must be prepared to do a lot of stair climbing and also respect the requests of the",

          "The Palace was incredible - by day and night. The entry fee was picked up by the tour company, but from memory, the costs were fairly minimal. There are bag checks, but nothing you wouldn't expect. The queues after security were no more than 20 minutes in duration. Groups",
          "Potala Palace is a unique icon of Tibet. Once you reach Lhasa and you will never miss this icon as it is built on top of a hill. This unique world heritage site is really filled with many history and also amazing architecture which still maintain the uniqueness until now. Here",

          "This is a must do in Lhasa, even though there a few steps to climb. It is worth the effort can take rests along the way if you are struggling with altitude. Don't miss it....",
          "There's a time limit on your stay at then Potala Palace but it it definitely still worth the visit. Exhausting to climb the steps due to the altitude and lack of oxygen, the palace itself is spectacular",

          "This visit to Potala Palace was awe inspiring. The 375 steps to the top of a high altitude will literally take your breath away. I have a fear of heights, yet did not experience any trouble here. The dedication and devotion of the worshipers is inspiring. My biggest regret was",

          "An old dream came through when we arrived in Tibet and visited Potala Palace. It\u2019s massive and beautiful inside as much as outside. The 340 steps added to the altitude of Lhasa (3.600 meters) were just a detail once we got up there.",
          "You must see Potala. Its is gorgeous in all ways. I wish to go again.Just dont be shocked if you loose breath on the way up!",
          "It is one of the main things to see in Lhasa, but too many people visit it at once. Lines and lines everywhere. Tickets come with reservation time and still it feels that there are too many people at once. Still worth it. Very impressive.",
          "We went to Potala Palace in January. We only saw two other foreigners and the rest of the people visiting were local Tibetan pilgrims. It was an amazing experience! The palace is huge. Definitely bring some good walking shoes. We brought 5 kids with us (ages 10, 8, 6, 4, 21",

          "Once the administrative seat of the Dalai Lama, Potala Palace is a 1000-room 14-storey structure on the highest point in the Tibetan capital.I would first recommend you wait till you've fully adjusted to the altitude before visiting this monument. It can be especially demanding",
          "Glad we had a few days to adjust to the elevation before climbing to the top of Potala Palace. It is breathtaking and a must do in Lhasa. You can even see a picture of the palace on the fifty yuan bill. Absolutely magnificent to visit. One of the highlights of visiting",
          "At 13,000 feet the air is thin, so beware you may feel faint. Your hotel should be able to provide you with some oxygen when you return. Go slow...no need to rush, but remember, you'll be going up an addition 1000 feet as you explore the Palace.",
          "Absolutely magnificent to visit, the Potala Palace makes you fully appreciate the depth and reach of Tibetan culture and heritage. Sadly it's simply a museum at the moment with a few monks allowed to stay there. The only good aspect of this is that visitors are allowed to go",
          "Obviously a 'must see'. Not because it's the focal point of Lhasa, but because it is so much more in the flesh than anything I had expected from photographs, video, documentaries, etc. While the history is challenging, the spirit of the place, its beauty, the uniqueness of",
          "A true wonder of the world. Lots of walking up involved to visit the upper palace. Don\u2019t recommend a visit your first day at altitude. Well worth the hike. Very tight security and must purchase tickets with your passport. Once you reach the upper section you are allowed 50",
          "Potala Palace is worth the effort it took to get there. I was violently ill with altitude sickness, but I wouldn't have missed this marvel for anything.",
          "It was more than I\u2019d expected or read. There was so much to take in and I could\u2019ve spent the whole day here. We had a guide and I would suggest if you can they be takes it slow. Meet and interact with the Monks if you can. One of the most incredible places in the world !",
          "One of the iconic places to visit in Lhasa. Known as the winter palace of the Dalai Lama's it sits 130m above the valley. Your guide must buy a ticket the day before and there are time frames to meet while touring. There was more to see inside the White and Red palaces than I",
          "All is calm and quiet, body, mind and spirit in use to ease your access and steep climb up the almost 500 steps outside....not to count the hundreds within the palace area and it's buildings. This is a must visit and worth every effort and time to enjoy it.",
          "Highly recommended. Definitely worth the 432 steps to climb, the star attraction of Lhasa. Take it easy if you have flown into Lhasa and acclimatise to the altitude.",
          "The palace looks beautiful from below. It is just off the city centre and easy to access. Unfortunately there are a lot of stairs to climb to access it - and remember this is at an elevation so climbing it is not for the faint-hearted, so you need to take it easy. Most of the",
          "Quite a place. Rich in Tibetan history and a must see if you are in Lhasa. There are VERY many steps and you may need to stop to eat severalties but the trek is worth while. Many centuries of Tibetan life are reflected here.",
          "This is the place must visit if you are in Lhasa. Very interesting with full of culture and history!",
          "Good experience but you need to book the ticket in advance and be there at the specific time as stated in the ticket. Usually, it is booked by the tour agent for you. It\u2019s a must visit place if you\u2019re in Lhasa",
          "As one grows up, the Potala Palace is at the top of your bucket list, just like the Eiffel Tower or the Vatican. Make sure you're up to the climb to the very top. the city is already at 4000 meters altitude altitude, so that you get out breath very easily, then steps and steps",
          "Such a beautiful temple. A once in a lifetime experience, climbing straight up 500 very steep and uneven steps, at 12,000ft. elevation. Well worth the shortness of breath every few hounded feet, to make the visit.",
          "You have seen pictures, but they do the palace little justice. Too bad you cant linger on your own and take in the aura of this place. It is very crowded and the tours rush you through the place because you only get 50 minutes to visit.",
          "In 2010, I went to Tibet, China and visited the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The place is named after Mount Potalaka. This amazing palace has the honor of being the highest ancient palace in the world. The palace is 13-stories,reaching 12,300 feet. I recommend you going there in the",
          "One of the best known sights of the world - visiting it is like a dream come true. Strenuous due the hight altitude but worth every effort. Spend as much time as you can - it is worth every minute!",
          "Yes, the Potala Palace is not just from outside a masterpiece of Tibetan architecture it is very interesting and unique what you can explore inside. Even there are for sure a lot of people on the way through this labyrinth it is something really different to experience. Just to",
          "This tour was great. I enjoyed every minute of it. The climb wasnt too bad, if you're in shape. The exterior views are fantastic, the building is enormous, and the views of Lhasa on the way up are terrific. The interiors are historic, amazing, and so interesting. You really",
          "We enjoyed our tour pf Potala Palace. It is an amazing place with so much history and religion. That being said, be mindful of the many steps it takes to get to the Dalai Lama residence on the 13th floor of the Palace.",
          "My wife and i prepared for this part of trip by taking the altitude pills. I think they helped as we were short of breath but never sick while in Tibet. See your doctor for these pills! The stairs going up are not tough if you just take your time. We were all over 65 and did",
          "Enjoyed our visit here. Tough climbing up to the top to start the tour due to the altitude. We did it on our second full day in Lhasa and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t try on day 1!",
          "Hard work climbing up to the top with the altitude but worth it. Walked down through the rooms. Doesn\u2019t seem as \u2018alive\u2019 as other places visited in Lhasa",
          "It was a majestic palace and a must visit! The climbing up is a bit strenous due to high altitude but always stop and enjoy the views. Take your time and soak in the view.",
          "A gorgeous site; but lots of steps to climb to the top. I counted over 400 steps, then lost count. I was told there were over 1000 rooms, but I visit only 20 rooms, then I was tire of seeing the same things over and over again. Unless you want to see 'everything' I suggest that",
          "Potala Palace is an amazing place. From its construction to the items it houses, everything is amazing about this place. Its a definite must see!!",
          "The place is an iconic representation of Tibet. Last place for the Dali Lama who is now in exile. Structure is beautifully maintained. A climb to the top is quite a challenge but the beauty can be appreciated from the grounds. The museum is top notch. A must see for",
          "The Potala Palace is incredible! So much history and culture in one place. I highly recommend a visit. Also visit the park across the road at night to see the palace lit up in all its glory.",
          "Just an amazing place to see. Even better up close. Well worth climbing up all the steps and seeing it from the inside. The inside is just as breathtaking as the outside. Definitely go at night and take photos from plaza across the street. The palace is all lite up.",
          "This is the iconic symbol of Lhasa no visit here is complete without it. Be prepared to climb stairs at 12000 ft this is not easy. The tombs of the Dalai lamas are here. While there are a limited number of the 1000 rooms available to see the highlights are covered in a walking",
          "Lots of steps, but the view is well worth it. Kids enjoyed this palace the most! Breathtaking to look at from the bottom.",
          "It was started in the 7th. century and it is a marvel how they managed to build it. About 300 steps to climb to the Palace. At almost 13,000 feet you don't climb very fast but worth the climb. Because so many people visit the Palace you have a 50 minute tour and have to be out.",
          "Lots of stairs to climb so may not be accessible to all but well worth the climb. Very interesting with lots of history. Beautiful inside but was unable to take pictures inside.",
          "As if this place needs a review -- it's epic!! One of the wonders of the world. Take a guided tour, walk around the gardens in back, too.",
          "Incredible, a true spectacle. Recommend going with a good tour guide who can talk you through the rich history of this building. Well worth the climb to the top, some great views back onto the city.",
          "Such a humble place, not so bad a hike up to the top. Loads of Buddha inside with fascinating faces and expressions and great views from outside",
          "Impressive palace but limited to 50 minutes tour visit. It is insufficient to have a good tour within 50 minutes.",
          "It\u2019s the Potala Palace!

          "We went here back in 2013 during our winter holiday with temperature far below zero degree. The palace was so tranquil and full of history, recollections and memories that can be passed to the next generations. We were so lucky to visit the place that witness the story of Tibet",
          "Be prepared to climb the 400 stairs of Potala in grace..! For those who are not used to the high altitude, I would suggest that you take an afternoon off to walk the streets of Lhasa when you first arrive in this city, before committing yourself to the spiritual walk in Potala",
          "This is one of the most amazing palace that everybody must visit. It is beautiful and stunning from the exterior. You will learn a lot of Tibetan culture by just visiting this palace. I would suggest to bring a Tibetan guide instead of a Chinese guide for the real Tibetan",

          "I was honored to see such a place. Incredible! Thank you for the chance to visit. Our guide helped us understand the history and different aspects of the beautiful place. In the morning I also was able to do my own Kora around the palace.",
          "Such a beautiful monument, steeped in history and culture. After completion of your day-time tour, return at night to see the palace under lights \u2013 just beautiful, peaceful and serene. Soak this all in whilst the pilgrims continue with their circumambulations. And if you are up",
          "The interior of the palace was mInd-boggling - I've never seen so many statures and gold! If you are only going to visit one building in Tibet then this is it. The tour includes the private living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and the chapels where they worshipped. There are many",
          "One of the highlights of tibet , the home of the dalai lama is a magnificent temple of huge proportions. A tour of the palace is highly recommended to gain an insight into the amazing history. Really is a sight to be seen",
          "The Potala Palace, is often the snow-covered pearl of the world. It was once the ruling center of Tibetan political and religious unity and has become the symbol of Lhasa and the whole of Tibet. Built in 1645, the Bolshoi Palace was first built by Songzan Gambu of the Tubo",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Lhasa. An amazing place. Our tickets were organised as part of our group but as they are a timed entry it would make sense to pre purchase as it is a sacred place for many Tibetans and it was very busy when we were there. The climb up the",
          "This is like the Western Wall in Jerusalem for the Tibetans. People come from all over the world to visit this place. They only allow a set # of tourists visiting each day. Therefore, getting the tickets in advance is strongly recommended. It's better to research and enlist help",
          "This place is a must see in Lhasa, the size of the place is just breathtaking. The inside of the palace is like a labyrinth with many corridors and doors you are bound to get lost and emmerse yourself in the rich Buddhist culture",
          "Spend a nice amount of time in the current Dalai Lama's throne room. It's so peaceful and say a prayer for him and his return. The whole Palace is wonderful. Make personal pilgrim goals to make the experience better and bring some sacrifices.",
          "The Potala Palace was the home of Dalai Lamas for hundreds of years before the current one fled in 1959. It is a physically imposing structure, set high on a hill and can be seen from much of the city of Lhasa. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. It's such a",
          "This was the highlight of our trip. Was able to climb up to the top. Do it at slow and even pace and you will not be out of breath. So spiritual and emotional to visit. Enjoy this experience!!",

          "We were concerned about walking up to Potala Palace as it was our first full day at 12,000 feet but our guide let us take our own pace and we successfully made it to the top. It is a beautiful place, well worth the effort to get there. Lots of history and color.",
          "The Potala Palace is arguably the most impressive building in Tibet. Originally the winter residence of the Dalai Llama, it dramatically rises above Lhasa and it is not until you stand at the bottom and look up that you realise how magnificent it truly is. The 432 steps to the",

          "Having joined a trip with Explore Tibet, we had the pleasure of seeing the Palace in low season. This was an amazing time to go, as there were very few tourists and many Tibetans around which made it a very authentic experience. The Palace was everything I had hoped for and",
          "Potala palace is a must see and do if you have even just a day in Lhasa. Rich in history and treasures and central to the Tibetan culture as it houses the tombs of most of the dalai lamas. Its well worth the climb and provides for great photo opportunities.",
          "You really don\u2019t get how big Potala is until you\u2019re at the bottom of the hill looking up at it. The walk is not easy, given Lhasa\u2019s altitude. It\u2019s a LOT of steps. Just take is slow and easy. There are over 1,000 rooms in the temple and only a fraction are open to the public.",
          "We walked the many steps to view the place.Our Tibetan guide taught us a lot about this big attraction. the history, the structure, the construction, etc... This was absolutely the highlight of Lhasa.",
          "You can spend hours and hours in the palace. Go with lots of time! It can be quite hard to get up the stairs, with the lack of oxygen. So if you are feeling the hights, the maybe wait a few days, or just take it very easy. But its simply wonderful, and its still a working",
          "One of the highlights of Tibet. Foreigners only get 1 hour to visit.... make sure you have your passport with you/guide so they can buy the ticket for you... which will have your passport number and will allow you to only be there for 1 hour.... The palace and the content are",

          "Before you even enter this palace, its sheer size inspires awe. It dominates the city skyline and is as iconic as the Taj Mahal in India. We were a private group of 2 and so were expecting unlimited time inside (Lonely Planet says it's possible if you buy 'individual' tickets)",

          "I have wanted to visit this palace for a long time and now I have been lucky enough to achieve that ambition. It looks fantastic from ground level and the climb up is quite hard going if you are not acclimatised to the altitude. Built in 1645 with 13 stories and over 100 rooms,",
          "A wonderfully kept building which was the Dalai Lama's home until his exile in 1958. It was a glorious day when we visited, so lots of people, and we did enjoy very much!",

          "If you are visiting Tibet, Potala Palace would certainly be one of the most important places to visit. Very impressive, rich cultural heritage. The only downside is that you will have very limited time inside and sometimes it gets crowded.",

          "It is a rather challenging climb, due to the high elevation. But it is so magnificent and a must visit!",
          "I loved see Potala Palace at night, all lite up. Going through it during the day was also super cool. Tickets were 200 rmb each (I think), but you have to have a guide with you, so ours were purchased through a travel agent. The guide cost is super expensive in Tibet. Most",
          "First, walk the kora (about 1-1.5 miles) around the temple. Not just a good warm up for the 700+ steps, but really feel the positive energy from everyone else walking it with you, praying and spinning the prayer wheels. Then, make your way in and start in on the steps.",
          "A must see if you are in Tibet. We visited after our grand tour and we felt it is better in a way to do it at the end rather than in the begining.",
          "This huge palace is in the centre of Lhasa and I am sure on every tourists list of places to visit. We were there early and the crowds weren't too bad. It is a good walk up to the palace entrance. I think it is doable for most people if taken slowly, especially if you are not",
          "be prepared to walk slowly and do it perhaps on or after the third day of your arrival in lhasa, allowing your body to do the adjustment would do you good. the walk up and down was great, views breathtaking. once in the assembly hall or other prayer rooms, most monasteries",
          "Perched on top of a hill overlooking Lhasa this has been the home for the 5th to the 14th Dalai Lama as a winter residence.It was also the seat of the government with chapels and tombs of the Dalai Lamas.There are over 1000 rooms mostly closed, and it is now more like a museum",

          "A wonderful experience to visit the Potala Palace. Whilst the walk up is challenging in the altitude the visit is well worth it. Do not be put off by the one hour visit restriction - your guide will get you through the most important rooms in time.",
          "This is one of the most seen destinations in Lhasa. A very old Palace that is an architectural beauty. In order to visit the place one has to plan well in advance. We understood that unless you book a ticket well in advance you will not be able to see the inside the place.",
          "A must..Lhasa is incomplete without this tour..full of history..mindblowing view of Lhasa from top of the palace",
          "Potala Palace is an architectural marvel. It is stunning from every angle and visitors get a different view at different levels of the structure. Walking through the Potala Palace is a spiritual experience when visitors see how the devoted buddhist pay their tributes and",

          "How how can this be number 90? should be number 1, when you stand outside and look up it is truely amazing, with altitude sickness, ie lack of oxygen, talking and walking an effort you look and think impossible, but you do it and OMG it is worth it, the views, although no photos",
          "A wonderful day in potala palas. It is hugh and very nice. You have to climb all stairs up, but it is very nice to see. Also in the evening you have a wonderful sight.",
          "This palace was simply breathtaking in its size, form and architecture. Very impressive, this is a must if you are in Lhasa. The queues were not long as you are allocated set times. Get there early! Staff were polite. Lots of places where pictures can be taken. The palace shop",
          "This was absolutely the highlight of Lhasa. Our Tibetan guide taught us a lot about this big attraction. The history, the construction,the structure, the daily life around the palace,etc. We asked our guide lots and lots of questions however we can only have no more than 1 hour",
          "Inside there are only a handful of rooms open now & times is restricted once you go indoors but v interesting & some beautiful decor. Would advise getting a Tibetan guide as it will avoid being bellowed at through a microphone but also politics plays a part in what you'll be",
          "Just amazing in the morning for sunrise, in the afternoon and night with the illumination. Cannot take photos inside :(",
          "The trek up will make you feel like a pilgrim. Most make it. Few Tibetans except at bottom of the whole complex on day I went. Very busy with tour groups mostly Chinese ones. Not awe inspiring.",

          "We found Potala palace even better than our first visit in Lhasa in 1991. More rooms, a very easy walk inside, clean. The problem are, as everywhere , thousands and thousands of China tourists- like in Venice- very few Western even in August. So the poetry of this beautiful",
          "Prepare for a slow climb up the spectacular palace. Highly recommended and would encourage all to visit before they cease access to the palace in a couple years time (according to our guide).",

          "Potala palace is a must-visit place when you are in Lhasa. From the outside, it is very stunning with a majestic view. To go up the palace, one has to climb many stairs, but the view from the top is amazing. There are a few ceremonial halls and stupas of the past Dalai Lama.",
          "This is the biggest attraction in Lhasa. It is HUUUGE and impressive. The buildings are well maintained and beautiful. You need to go with a tour group if you are not Tibetan or Chinese. The place is very well managed and you may even get to talk to one of the many monks who",

          "A long hike up hundreds of steps to travel through time and feel the atmosphere of Tibet from the first day",
          "The size of the Potala palace and its location on top of the hill is magnificient. The parikrama or the walk around the palace is must as all the prayer wheels are behind the base of the palace. The gardens in front and around the palace are nice. Booking to enter this palace",

          "We absolutely loved our visit to the Potala Palace! It was so surreal walking around this wonderfully historic palace. The stair climb up is hard but as long as you go slowly you will be fine. Wear good shoes! Could of spent more time there but it does get crowded with tour",
          "The Potala Palace is a stunningly beautiful palace nested right on top of the Lhasa hillock. Apparently Dalai Lama used to live while he was in Tibet.",
          "This tour required booking by a local tour company and to be in the company of a registered guide. It is a good idea to book ahead a little especially in the peak season of summer. We were grateful we did this tour towards the latter part of our four day stay so we could be",
          "It is worth the 400 or so steps to get to the top. The Tibetan culture lives here and the Dalai Lama's presence is felt here even when he will never return. It's a mystical place that has to be visited to be understood. I loved it and hope to be back some day. It is a pretty",
          "We visited to Tibet for 10 days trip on May-June 2017. This is a must visit attraction for every tourist. We walked up to the palace took about 30 min. A tour guide is recommended. Make sure enter into the palace follow the time on the ticket. Visit to inner palace is restricted",
          "There are security cameras every where, it's disconcerting. We visited the 2nd day of our trip so we had acclimatized more, but very steep ascent and steps inside can be steep. Only a tiny part of the Palace is open to the public.",
          "It is very impressive and architecturally interesting. Inside it is forbidden to shoot, but also the outdoor areas are very nice. The only negative is the short stay time given.",
          "Truly and amazing structure, the red and white contrasted with the blue sky background offers amazing views and pictures. Take your time on the accent and enjoy the view. A must see if your in the area. No pictures are allowed in the temple proper, so get all your shots on the",

          "This was on our bucket list of places to visit. Went on a very nice day. Only complaint is how the schedules and times were very limiting. We were actually told to hurry along several times. Our guide was Passang and he was very knowledgeable and did an excellent job of showing",

          "Inside the palace is nice, a bit tired of so many chambers, Budhas and Dalais names for me. But watching the massive huge structure is breathtaking, probably along with sky color and children's faces the very best of Tibet",
          "This is a magical place, definately for those who have been lucky to see it in person it is a life changing experience. For those who have not, consider it for your future vacations. I got there by train and all arranged by Tibet Travel as you cannot go there just by yourself as",

          "Be prepared to walk for a couple of hours and you get to see the best overview of Tibetan history. With a good local guide, you get to hear the rest of the story too. This is probably the best museum in the country. There are only 30s or so rooms open to public. It keeps",
          "We are senior siblings who enjoy traveling together. We all worked out for a couple months getting ready for the long climb to the top of this monastery, not one of us wanting to be the \"weakest link\"! We were fortunate to have a very caring guide, Kunga, from Tibet Vista who",

          "To utilize text to describe this palace would not do it justice! We toured this palace with Tibet Vista and it was phenomenal! It was unreal to visit one of the original places tjat the actual Dalai Lama resided in! Loved it! Just go!!",
          "Needless to mention how special this place was, is and will always be, but you've got to checkout the interesting parts of it. For example, the white paint covering most of the palace exterior was a mixture of yuk milk and lime, which made the whole palace smell quite a bit, on",

          "The Potala is in walking distance from the center of Lhasa. It is impressive to see all the Tibetan people who walk around the hill. Your guide have to make a reservation for your visit. Don't visit the palace the first of second day of your stay in Lhasa, because the climbing",

          "The visit to the palace is as hyped as it gets. The steps up the Potala Palace is more like ramp than steps; so even at 3600m, the ascend is still okay. You do not have to be particularly fit. The architecture is amazing on both the inside and outside; and you would be better",

          "Our visit to Potala Palace was great, the Palace is great but you need to be fit to go over the 300 steps to reach it, the time that you can stay inside the Palace is controled, but the visit totally worth it!",
          "Love the architecture of the Potala Palace! The buildings were distinguished by the color red/ white for the usages. The building itself is very strong, withstand the destruction from cultural revolution. One thing though, too many tourists! But so far it is one of my favorite",
          "Potala reflects the entire history of Tibet a visit to this site is a must for all visitors to Tibet.",

        "wiki": "Norbulingka (Standard Tibetan: \u0f53\u0f7c\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f40\u0f0b; Wylie: Nor-bu-gling-ka; simplified Chinese: \u7f57\u5e03\u6797\u5361; traditional Chinese: \u7f85\u5e03\u6797\u5361; literally \"Jeweled Park\") is a palace and surrounding park in Lhasa, Tibet, China, built from 1755. It served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas from the 1780s up until the 14th Dalai Lama's exile in 1959. Part of the \"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace\", Norbulingka is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was added as an extension of this Historic Ensemble in 2001.  It was built by the 7th Dalai Lama and served both as administrative centre and religious centre. It is a unique representation of Tibetan palace architecture.\nNorbulingka Palace is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace. Norbulingka covers an area of around 36 hectares (89 acres) and considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet.Norbulingka park is considered the premier park of all such horticultural parks in similar ethnic settings in Tibet. During the summer and autumn months, the parks in Tibet, including the Norbulinga, become hubs of entertainment with dancing, singing, music and festivities. The park is where the annual Sho Dun or 'Yoghurt Festival' is held.\nThe Norbulingka palace has been mostly identified with the 13th and the 14th Dalai Lamas who commissioned most of the structures that still stand today. During the invasion of Tibet in 1950, a number of buildings were damaged, but were rebuilt beginning in 2003, when the Chinese government initiated renovation works here to restore some of the damaged structures, and also the greenery, the flower gardens and the lakes.\n\n\n== Names ==\nIn Tibetan, Norbulingka means \u201cTreasure Garden.\u201d or Treasure Park\". The word 'Lingka' is commonly used in Tibet to define all horticultural parks in Lhasa and other cities. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Norbulingka was renamed People's Park and opened to the public.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nThe palace, with 374 rooms, is located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the Potala Palace, which was the winter palace. It is in the western suburb of Lhasa City on the bank of the Kyichu River. When construction of the palace was started (during the 7th Dalai Lama's period) in the 1740s, the site was a barren land, overgrown with weeds and scrub and infested with wild animals.The park, situated at an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) had flower gardens of roses, petunias, hollyhocks, marigolds, chrysanthemums and rows of herbs in pots and rare plants. Fruit trees including apple, peach and apricot were also reported (but the fruits did not ripen in Lhasa), and also poplar trees and bamboo. In its heyday, the Norbulingka grounds were also home to wildlife in the form of peacocks and brahminy ducks in the lakes. The park was so large and well-laid-out, that cycling around the area was even permitted to enjoy the beauty of the environment. The gardens are a favorite picnic spot, and provide for a beautiful venue for theater, dancing and festivals, particularly the Shodun or 'Yogurt Festival' at the beginning of August, with families camping in the grounds for days, surrounded by colorful makeshift windbreaks of rugs and scarves while enjoying the height of summer weather.\nThere is also a zoo at Norbulingka, originally created to house the animals which were given to the Dalai Lamas. Heinrich Harrer helped the 14th Dalai Lama build a small movie theater there in the 1950s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNorbulingka Palace of the Dalai Lamas was built about 100 years after the Potala Palace was built on the Parkori peak, over a 36 hectares (89 acres) land area. It was built a little away to the west of the Potala for the exclusive use by the Dalai Lama to stay in during the summer months. Tenzing Gyatso, the present 14th Dalai Lama, stayed here before he fled to India. The building of the palace and the park was undertaken by the 7th Dalai Lama from 1755. The Norbulingka Park and Summer Palace were completed in 1783 under Jampel Gyatso, the 8th Dalai Lama, on the outskirts of Lhasa. and became the summer residence during the reign of the Eighth Dalai Lama.\nThe earliest history of Norbulingka is traced originally to a spring at this location, which was used during the summer months by the 7th Dalai Lama to cure his health problems. Qing Dynasty permitted the Dalai Lama to build a palace at this location for his stay, as a resting pavilion. Since subsequent Dalai Lamas also used to stay here for their studies (before enthronement) and as a summer resort, Norbulingka came to be known as the Summer Palace of the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe 8th Dalai Lama was responsible for many additions to the Norbulingka complex in the form of palaces and gardens. However, it is sometimes reported that 6th through to 12th Dalai Lamas died young and under mysterious circumstances, conjectured as having been poisoned. Most of the credit for the expansion of Norbulingka is given to the 13th and the 14th Dalai Lamas.It was from the Norbulingka palace that the Dalai Lama escaped to India on 17 March 1959, under the strong belief that he would be captured by the Chinese. On this day, the Dalai Lama dressed like an ordinary Tibetan, and, carrying a rifle across his shoulder, left the Norbulinga palace and Tibet to seek asylum in India. As there was a dust storm blowing at that time, he was not recognized. According to Reuters, \u201cThe Dalai Lama and his officials, who had also escaped from the palace, rode out of the city on horses to join his family for the trek to India\u201d. The Chinese discovered this \"great escape\" only two days later. The party journeyed through the Himalayas for two weeks, and finally crossed the Indian border where they received political asylum. Norbulingka was later surrounded by protesters and subject to an attack by the Chinese.The summer residence of the Dalai Lama, located in the Norbulingka Park, is now a tourist attraction. The palace has a large collection of Italian chandeliers, Ajanta frescoes, Tibetan carpets, and many other artifacts. Murals of Buddha and the 5th Dalai Lama are seen in some rooms. The 14th Dalai Lama\u2019s (who fled from Tibet and took asylum in India) meditation room, bedroom, conference room and bathroom are part of the display and are explained to tourists.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nBuilt in the 18th century, the Norbulingka Palace and the garden within its precincts have undergone several additions over the years. The vast complex covers a garden area of 3.6 km2 including 3.4 km2 of lush green pasture land covered with forests. It is said to be the \u201chighest garden\u201d anywhere in the world and has earned the epithet \u201cPlateau Oxygen Bar.\u201dThe Norbulingka is the \"world's highest, largest and best-preserved ancient artificial horticultural garden\"., which also blends gardening with architecture and sculpture arts from several Tibetan ethnic groups; 30,000 cultural relics of ancient Tibetan history are preserved here. The complex is demarcated under five distinct sections. A cluster of buildings to the left of the entrance gate is the Kelsang Phodang (The full name of this palace is \"bskal bzang bde skyid pho brang\"), named after the 7th Dalai Lama, Kelsang Gyatso (1708\u20131757).  It is a three-storied palace with chambers for the worship of Buddha, bedrooms, reading rooms and shelters at the centre. The Khamsum Zilnon, a two-storied pavilion, is opposite the entry gate. The 8th Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso (1758\u20131804) substantially enlarged the palace by adding three temples and the perimeter walls on the south east sector and the park also came to life with plantation of fruit trees and evergreens brought from various parts of Tibet. The garden was well developed with a large retinue of gardeners. To the northwest of Kelsang Phodrong is the Tsokyil Phodrong, which is a pavilion in the midst of a lake and the Chensil Phodrong. On the west side of Norbulingka is the Golden Phodron, built by a benefactor in 1922, and a cluster of buildings which were built during the 13th Dalai Lama's time. The 13th Dalai Lama was responsible for architectural modifications, including the large red doors to the palace; he also improved the Chensel Lingkha garden to the northwest. To the north of Tsokyil Phodrong is the Takten Migyur Phodrong which was built in 1954 by 14th Dalai Lama and is the most elegant palace in the complex, a fusion of a temple and villa. The new summer palace, which faces south, was built with Central Government funds, and completed in 1956.The earliest building is the Kelsang Palace built by the Seventh Dalai Lama which is \"a beautiful example of Yellow Hat architecture. Dalai Lamas watched, from the first floor of this palace, the folk operas held opposite to the Khamsum Zilnon during the Shoton festival. Its fully restored throne room is also of interest.\"The Norbulingka \u2019s most dramatic area was the Lake Palace, built in the southwest area. In the centre of the lake, three islands were connected to the land by short bridges. A palace was built on each island. A horse stable and a row of four houses contained the gifts received by the Dalai Lamas from the Chinese emperors and other foreign dignitaries.Construction of the 'New Palace' was begun in 1954 by the present Dalai Lama, and completed in 1956. It is a double-story structure with a Tibetan flat roof. It has an elaborate layout with a maze of rooms and halls. This modern complex contains chapels, gardens, fountains and pools. It is a modern Tibetan-style building embellished with ornamentation and facilities. In the first floor of this building, there are 301 paintings (frescoes) on Tibetan history, dated to the time when Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama met Chairman Mao Zedong. As of 1986, the palace had an antique Russian radio, and a Philips console still containing old 78 rpm records.\n\nThe entire Norbulingka complex was delimited by two sets of walls. The area encompassed by the inner wall, painted yellow, was exclusively for the use of the Dalai Lama and his attendants. Officials and the Dalai Lama's royal family lived in the area between the inner yellow wall and the outer wall. A dress code was followed for visitors to enter the palace; those wearing Tibetan dress were allowed; guards posted at the gates controlled the entry, and ensured that no western hat-wearing people (which was made popular in Tibet during Lhamdo Dhondups time) were allowed inside. Wearing shoes inside the park was banned. Guards at the gate offered a formal arms salute to the nobles and high-ranking officials. Even the officials at the lower category also received a salute. The gates outside the yellow wall were heavily protected. Only the Dalai Lama and his guardians could pass through these gates. Tibetan mastiff dogs kept in niches of the compound walls, and tied with long yak hair leashes, were the guard dogs that patrolled the perimeter of the Norbulingka.On the east gate to the Norbulingka there are two Snow Lion statues covered in khatas (thin white scarves offered as a mark of respect), the Snow Lion on the left is accompanied by a lion cub. The mythical Snow Lion is the symbol of Tibet; according to legend they jump from one snow peak to another. Most of the buildings are closed now; have become storehouses or used as offices for those who take care of the maintenance works. Some additional buildings seen now are souvenir kiosks catering to the visitors.\n\n\n== Restoration and preservation ==\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the Norbulingka complex suffered extensive damage. However, in 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. Grant funds to the extent of 67.4 million Yuan (US$8.14 million) were sanctioned in 2002 by the Central Government for restoration work; restoration work beginning in 2003 mainly covered the Kelsang Phodron Palace, the Kashak Cabinet offices and many other structures.Norbulingka was declared a \"National Important Cultural Relic Unit\u201d, in 1988 by the State council. On 14 December 2001, UNESCO inscribed it as a World Heritage Site as part of the \"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace\". The historic ensemble covers three monuments namely, the Potala Palace, winter palace of the Dalai Lama, the Jokhang Temple Monastery and the Norbulingka, the Dalai Lama's former summer palace built in the 18th century considered a masterpiece of Tibetan art. The citation states: \"preservation of vestiges of the traditional Tibetan architecture\". This is viewed in the context of extensive modern development that has taken place under Chinese suzerainty in Tibet. The Chinese State Tourism Administration has also categorized Norbulingka at a \u201cGrade 4 A at the National Tourism (spot) level,\u201d in 2001. It was also declared a public park in 1959.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\n\nSho Dun Festival, also spelt Shoton Festival, (popularly known as the \"yogurt festival\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka. The date for the festival is set according to the Tibetan calendar, which is a Lunar-based calendar. The festival is celebrated during the seventh month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar. The week-long festivities are marked by eating and drinking, with Ache Lhamo, the Tibetan opera performances as the highlight, held in the park and other venues in the city. On this occasion yak races are a special attraction held in the Lhasa stadium. During this festival, famed Opera troupes from different regions of Tibet perform at the Norbulingka grounds; the first opera troupe was founded in the 15th century by Tangtong Gyelpo, considered the Leonardo da Vinci of Tibet. Over the centuries other opera formats of the 'White Masked Sect' and the \"innovative\" 'Black Masked Sect' added to the repertoire, and all these forms and subsequent innovations are enacted at the Sho Dun festival. The Chinese observe the holidays of the Chinese calendar at the Norbulingka grounds with Tibetan music and dance under Government patronage. Tibetans also observe traditional holidays with Tibetan music and dance at this venue.During the reign of the Dalai Lamas (from the 7th Dalai Lama onwards), their annual shifting of residence from the Potala Palace to Norbulingka Palace was also an elaborate festive event. The Dalai Lama used to be escorted in a glittering procession to spend 6 months of the summer season in the Norbulingka Palace.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "wiki": "The Jokhang (Tibetan: \u0f47\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f44\u0f0d, Chinese: \u5927\u662d\u5bfa), also known as the Qoikang Monastery, Jokang, Jokhang Temple, Jokhang Monastery and Zuglagkang (Tibetan: \u0f42\u0f59\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f44\u0f0c\u0f0d, Wylie: gtsug-lag-khang, ZYPY: Zuglagkang or Tsuklakang), is a Buddhist temple in Barkhor Square in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet. Tibetans, in general, consider this temple as the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. The temple is currently maintained by the Gelug school, but they accept worshipers from all sects of Buddhism. The temple's architectural style is a mixture of Indian vihara design, Tibetan and Nepalese design.\nThe Jokhang was founded during the reign of King Songtsen Gampo. According to tradition, the temple was built for the king's two brides: Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal. Both are said to have brought important Buddhist statues and images from China and Nepal to Tibet, which were housed here, as part of their dowries. The oldest part of the temple was built in 652. Over the next 900 years, the temple was enlarged several times with the last renovation done in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama. Following the death of Gampo, the image in Ramcho Lake temple was moved to the Jokhang temple for security reasons. When King Tresang Detsen ruled from 755 to 797, the Buddha image of the Jokhang temple was hidden, as the king's minister was hostile to the spread of Buddhism in Tibet. During the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to have been used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal taught in Jokhang.\nAround the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists have worked on the temple's design and construction.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe temple, considered the \"spiritual heart of the city\" and the most sacred in Tibet, is at the center of an ancient network of Buddhist temples in Lhasa. It is the focal point of commercial activity in the city, with a maze of streets radiating from it. The Jokhang is 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) east of the Potala Palace. Barkhor, the market square in central Lhasa, has a walkway for pilgrims to walk around the temple (which takes about 20 minutes). Barkhor Square is marked by four stone sankang (incense burners), two of which are in front of the temple and two in the rear.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nRasa Thrulnag Tsuklakang (\"House of Mysteries\" or \"House of Religious Science\") was the Jokhang's ancient name. When King Songtsen built the temple his capital city was known as Rasa (\"Goats\"), since goats were used to move earth during its construction. After the king's death, Rasa became known as Lhasa (Place of the Gods); the temple was called Jokhang\u2014\"Temple of the Lord\"\u2014derived from Jowo Shakyamuni Buddha, its primary image. The Jokhang's Chinese name is Dazhao; it is also known as Zuglagkang, Qoikang Monastery Tsuglakhang and Tsuglhakhange.\n\n\n== History ==\nTibetans viewed their country as a living entity controlled by srin ma (pronounced \"sinma\"), a wild demoness who opposed the propagation of Buddhism in the country. To thwart her evil intentions, King Songtsen Gampo (the first king of a unified Tibet) developed a plan to build twelve temples across the country. The temples were built in three stages. In the first stage central Tibet was covered with four temples, known as the \"four horns\" (ru bzhi). Four more temples, (mtha'dul), were built in the outer areas in the second stage; the last four, the yang'dul, were built on the country's frontiers. The Jokhang temple was finally built in the heart of the srin ma, ensuring her subjugation.\n\nTo forge ties with neighboring Nepal, Songtsen Gampo sent envoys to King Amsuvarman seeking his daughter's hand in marriage and the king accepted. His daughter, Bhrikuti, came to Tibet as the king's Nepalese wife (tritsun; belsa in Tibetan). The image of Akshobhya Buddha (or Mikyoba), which she had brought as part of her dowry, was deified in a temple in the middle of a lake known as Ramoche.Gampo, wishing to obtain a second wife from China, sent his ambassador to Emperor Taizong (627\u2013650) of the Tang dynasty for one of his daughters. Taizong rejected the king's proposal, considering Tibetans \"barbarians\", and announced the marriage of one of his daughters to the king of Duyu, a Hun. This infuriated Gampo, who mounted attacks on tribal areas affiliated with the Tang dynasty and then attacked the Tang city of Songzhou. Telling the emperor that he would escalate his aggression unless the emperor agreed to his proposal, Gampo sent a conciliatory gift of a gold-studded \"suit of armour\" with another request for marriage. Taizong conceded, giving Princess Wencheng to the Tibetan king. When Wencheng went to Tibet in 640 as the Chinese wife of the king (known as Gyasa in Tibet), she brought an image of Sakyamuni Buddha as a young prince. The image was deified in a temple originally named Trulnang, which became the Jokhang. The temple became the holiest shrine in Tibet and the image, known as Jowo Rinpoche, has become the country's most-revered idol.The oldest part of the temple was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a location for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple was built on the filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.The temple's design and construction are attributed to Nepalese craftsmen. After Songtsen Gampo's death, Queen Wencheng reportedly moved the statue of Jowo from the Ramoche temple to the Jokhang temple to secure it from Chinese attack. The part of the temple known as the Chapel was the hiding place of the Jowo Sakyamuni.During the reign of King Tresang Detsan from 755 to 797, Buddhists were persecuted because the king's minister, Marshang Zongbagyi (a devotee of Bon), was hostile to Buddhism. During this time the image of Akshobya Buddha in the Jokhang temple was hidden underground, reportedly 200 people failed to locate it. The images in the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were moved to Jizong in Ngari, and the monks were persecuted and driven from Jokhang. During the anti-Buddhist activity of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to be used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal who taught in Jokhang and died in 1054, found the \"Royal Testament of the Pillar\" (Bka' chems ka khol ma) in a pillar at Jokhang; the document was said to be the testament of Songtsen Gampo.\n\nBeginning in about the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. It is said that the image of Buddha deified in the Jokhang is the 12-year-old Buddha earlier located in the Bodh Gaya Temple in India, indicating \"historical and ritual\" links between India and Tibet. Tibetans call Jokhang the \"Vajrasana of Tibet\" (Bod yul gyi rDo rje gdani), the \"second Vajrasana\" (rDo rje gdan pal) and \"Vajrasan, the navel of the land of snow\" (Gangs can sa yi lte ba rDo rje gdani).After the occupation of Nepal by the Gorkhas in 1769, during the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792 the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty drove the Gorkhas from Tibet and the Tibetans were isolated from their neighbors. The period, lasting for more than a century, has been called \"the Dark Age of Tibet\". Pilgrimages outside the country were forbidden for Tibetans, and the Qianlong Emperor suggested that it would be equally effective to worship the Jowo Buddha at the Jokhang.In Chinese development of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when the walkway around the temple was destroyed. An inner walkway was converted into a plaza, leaving only a short walkway as a pilgrimage route. In the square, religious objects related to the pilgrimage are sold.During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this and the end of persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.Two flagstone doring (inscribed pillars) outside the temple, flanking its north and south entrances, are worshiped by Tibetans. The first monument, a March 1794 edict known as the \"Forever Following Tablet\" in Chinese, records advice on hygiene to prevent smallpox; some has been chiseled out by Tibetans who believed that the stone itself had curative powers. The second, far older, pillar is 5.5 metres (18 ft) high with a crown in the shape of a palace and an inscription dated 821 or 822. The tablet has a number of names; \"Number One Tablet in Asia\", \"Lhasa Alliance Tablet\", \"Changing Alliance Tablet\", \"Uncle and Nephew Alliance Tablet\" and the \"Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet\". Its inscription, in Tibetan and Chinese, is a treaty between the Tibetan king Ralpacan and the Chinese emperor Muzong delineating the boundary between their countries. Both inscriptions were enclosed by brick walls when Barkhor Square was developed in 1985. The Sino-Tibetan treaty reads, \"Tibet and China shall abide by the frontiers of which they are now in occupation. All to the east is the country of Great China; and all to the west is, without question, the country of Great Tibet. Henceforth on neither side shall there be waging of war nor seizing of territory. If any person incurs suspicion he shall be arrested; his business shall be inquired into and he shall be escorted back\".According to the Dalai Lama, among the many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was believed to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994) to facilitate conservation efforts. The temple is listed in the first group of State Cultural Protection Relic Units, and has been categorized as a 4A-level tourist site.On February 17, 2018, the temple caught fire at 6:40 p.m. (local time), before sunset in Lhasa, with the blaze lasting until late that evening. Although photos and videos about the fire were spread on Chinese social media, which showed the eaved roof of a section of the building lit with roaring yellow flames and emitting a haze of smoke, these images were quickly censored and disappeared. The official newspaper Tibet Daily briefly claimed online that the fire was \"quickly extinguished\" with \"no deaths or injuries\" at the late night, while The People's Daily published the same words online and added that there had been \"no damage to relics\" in the temple; both of these reports contained no photos. The temple was temporarily closed after the fire but were reopened to public on February 18, according to official Xinhua news agency. But the yellow draperies had been newly hung behind the temple's central image, the Jowo statue. And no one was allowed to enter the second floor of the temple, according to the source of Radio Free Asia's Tibetan Service. The fire burned an area of about 50 square meters. The temple's golden cupola had been removed to guard against any collapse and protective supports had been added around the Jowo statue, according to Xinhua.  On February 19, 2018, the Dalai Lama's supporters based in India reported eyewitness accounts that \"the source of the fire is not the Jowo chapel but from an adjacent chapel within the Jokhang temple premises known in Tibetan as Tsuglakhang\" and confirming that there were \"no casualties and damage to property is yet to be ascertained\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Jokhang temple covers an area of 2.51 hectares (6.2 acres). When it was built during the seventh century, it had eight rooms on two floors to house scriptures and sculptures of the Buddha. The temple had brick-lined floors, columns and door frames and carvings made of wood. During the Tubo period, there was conflict between followers of Buddhism and the indigenous Bon religion. Changes in dynastic rule affected the Jokhang Monastery; after 1409, during the Ming dynasty, many improvements were made to the temple. The second and third floors of the Buddha Hall and the annex buildings were built during the 11th century. The main hall is the four-story Buddha Hall.\n\nThe temple has an east-west orientation, facing Nepal to the west in honour of Princess Bhrikuti. Additionally, the monastery's main gate faces west. The Jokhang is aligned along an axis, beginning with an arch gate and followed by the Buddha Hall, an enclosed  passage, a cloister, atriums and a hostel for the lamas (monks). Inside the entrance are four \"Guardian Kings\" (Chokyong), two on each side. The main shrine is on the ground floor. On the first floor are murals, residences for the monks and a private room for the Dalai Lama, and there are residences for the monks and chapels on all four sides of the shrine. The temple is made of wood and stone. Its architecture features the Tibetan Buddhist style, with influences from China, Indian vihara design and Nepal. The roof is covered with gilded bronze tiles, figurines and decorated pavilions.\n\nThe central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch leads to the open courtyard, which is two concentric circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, with a number of large prayer wheels (nangkhor); this path leads to the main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king's Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of  occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled crown, cover around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his left hand on his lap and his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future). Incarnations of Sakyamuni are enshrined on either side of a central axis, and the Buddha's warrior guard is in the middle of the halls on the left side.In addition to the main hall and its adjoining halls, on both sides of the Buddha Hall are dozens of 20-square-metre (220 sq ft) chapels. The Prince of Dharma chapel is on the third floor, including sculptures of Songtsen Gampo, Princess Wencheng, Princess Bhrikuti, Gar Tongtsan (the Tabo minister) and Thonmi Sambhota, the inventor of Tibetan script. The halls are surrounded by enclosed walkways.Decorations of winged apsaras, human and animal figurines, flowers and grasses are carved on the superstructure. Images of sphinxes with a variety of expressions are carved below the roof.The temple complex has more than 3,000 images of the Buddha and other deities (including an 85-foot (26 m) image of the Buddha) and historical figures, in addition to manuscripts and other objects. The temple walls are decorated with religious and historical murals.\n\nOn the rooftop and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer flanking a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish. The temple interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.In addition to walking around the temple and spinning prayer wheels, pilgrims prostrate themselves before approaching the main deity; some crawl a considerable distance to the main shrine. The prayer chanted during this worship is \"Om mani padme hum\" (Hail to the jewel in the lotus). Pilgrims queue on both sides of the platform to place a ceremonial scarf (katak) around the Buddha's neck or touch the image's knee. A walled enclosure in front of the Jokhang, near the Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet, contains the stump of a willow known as the \"Tang Dynstay Willow\" or the \"Princess Willow\". The willow was reportedly planted by Princess Wencheng.\n\n\n== Buddhist scriptures and sculptures ==\nThe Jokhang has a sizable, significant collection of cultural artifacts, including Tang-dynasty bronze sculptures and finely-sculpted figures in different shapes from the Ming dynasty. Among hundreds of thangkas, two notable paintings of Chakrasamvara and Yamanataka date to the reign of the Yongle Emperor; both are embroidered on silk and well-preserved.

          "For us this was the best place in Lhasa. We could have spent days or even years there, just sitting around and watching the locals, which were giving us energy just with their presence. A place which is hard to describe, you have to see it to feel it and be prepared to get an",

          "What goes on outside the Jokhang Temple is every bit as fascinating as what goes on inside. Outside, there are numerous devotees of the Buddhist religion performing the \u201clong prayer\u201d. Inside, there is so much to learn that a normal visit doesn\u2019t do the Temple justice. You",
          "This is a simple temple and we enjoyed it. Far more interesting however were the hordes of locals who have travelled from miles away to walk around it and worship. I could have sat and watched them all day",
          "We stayed 4 nights in Lhasa and walked the road around the temple every evening with the faithful. We enjoyed the the outer atmosphere very much. Inside with our guide, we were most amazed by the inner rooms blackened by over 1300 years of burning incense and now butter lamps.",
          "They say if you did jot visit Jokhang temple, you did not visit Lhasa. A heap of history as it is considered one of the oldest and most holy temples in Tibet. Be sure to get a guide to fully appreciate all the small things you would otherwise miss.",
          "The history of this place is epic--be sure to get the context of what you are seeing, or you will miss much of its significance. It is a beautiful temple, I especially liked the assembly room with the monk's robes discarded on the mats. The many pilgrims are also a cultural",
          "On the day we walked through in early April, it was way to crowded and definitely a safety hazard since once you start, you cannot go back or out until you get to the stairs to the upstairs' portion. At one point, some of us felt like we were being crushed in a storm of people",
          "The good historical and religious site to learn about Tibet, people and culture. Definitely recommend it to people traveling there.",
          "Reached only by walking in the old town area this temple is regarded as one of the most important for the buddhists. Lots of pilgrims all the time. A great feeling of Tibetan culture and religiosity.",
          "Stunning temple in the midst of the Barkhor Market. Here hundreds come daily to pray and you feel the Tibetan spirit. It's a glimpse into the culture that remains intact despite the government's efforts to reform.",

          "I was surprised at how much I like the Jokhang Temple. It was fascinating watching the local Tibetan pilgrims praying and making offerings here. All day long (even at night) there are tons of people circling this temple. I definitely recommend taking part in it and walking",
          "It's an amazing spiritual temple, where people come from different part of the Tibet including many other countries. The temple and surroundings were so much culturally preserved and offered the best atmosphere of pilgrimages.",
          "This temple is the most sacred site in Tibet. There ae many reasons to visit and admire this site. I will focus on the colors. The ubiquity of brilliant colors has to do with their significance in TIbetan Buddhism. There are five main colors (known as pancha-varna in Sanskrit,",
          "Just watching the devotion of the Tibetan's is amazing to witness. Beautiful temple, friendly people. I am very glad our group went here. A gem not to be missed.",
          "Despite being on the usual tourist trail, just don't miss this monastery. Yes, it was damaged and reconstructed, but it has much to offer in terms of history, art, devotional practice and local colour. Wonderful atmosphere. Unfortunately, the upstairs library and bookshop were",

          "We visited this during the womans festival and the full moon. The sheer devotion and prostration of normal Tibetans who have travelled many miles in front of Jokhang Temple us humbling. Repeatedly prostrating on cold hard stone with the chilling wind was awesome to see.",
          "From the outside the temple did not look particularly significant, even though it is the most important in the country. But, getting closer you can see lots of people in front of it doing repeated prostrations on the pavements - fascinating to watch. Inside you get a much better",
          "The importance of this temple is so evident in the faces of the Tibetans who come here. It is a real \"working\" place of worship, reverence and spirituality. You can't help but be swept along with the beautiful energy of the place. The sincerity of the devotees as they prostrate",
          "Visit this temple if you find yourself in Lhasa and if you are interested in learning local culture.",
          "Like the Potala, it's a living temple, so that you will see long lines of Tibetan worshippers coming from all over the country. Your thin line of visitors goes faster through the numerous chappels and alters, and the spirituality of the place invades you as you see more and",
          "If you go on a tour you will miss the essence of this magnificent temple. We went in the morning when all the Tibetan pilgrims line up to see their holiest chapels. Be patient and make the line on the left. You will be standing in line with hundreds of locals pushing and",
          "It was quite crowded when we were there. Hardly any other Westerners, but lots of mainland Chinese and of course lots of Tibetans. You always felt sort of pushed around... A great temple with remarkable statues and wall-paintings. Just as interesting the \"market\" square outside,",
          "Jokhang Temple is beautiful. You must visit. Its fantastic, the buildings the artwork, the atmosphere, the people, the devotion. Great place to spend a few hours, and you'll enjoy every minute.",
          "WE passed by this temple everyday during our stay in Lhasa. We saw people in their prayer rituals in and around the temple. Very fascinating to watch.",
          "Wow! This place was crowded on our visit and had the strong smell of incense everywhere. Go with a tour group as they are paying customers and have a special line to use to enter. Locals are free but the wait is pretty long. A nice visit. The \"government store\" in the area",
          "Really enjoyed visiting. Quite a lot of tourists (glad we came after the Chinese October Holiday as we were told it was packed then!) but also lots of Tibetans praying in the shrines.",
          "Beautiful building but quite busy with many tourists. You have to see it if in Lhasa as it is the central temple of buddhism.",
          "This is the most sacred temple in Tibet Buddhism. It is surrounded by Barkhor street and you can people walking around it in circles all day.",
          "The Mecca for Buddhist. Last place the Dali Lama stayed before exile to India. Very lovely ancient structures. Well worth the time and effort to visit. Temple itself is quite moving generating significant respect for this religion.",
          "Built centuries ago, Lhasa grew around this temple with the Barkor square and shopping area. While there are the expected density of tourist shops this is a serious marketplace surrounding the temple. The history of Tibet holds this first temple to be central.",
          "This is a very old temple in old Lhasa. It is fronted by two huge incense burners, dozens of people prostrating themselves, and worshipers (and tourists) entering the temple.After you clear security you walk into a large courtyard. It\u2019s not too interesting but you can see the",
          "Temple located within the city centre (Old quarter). Come evening time you will see a lot of devotee walk to the temple and pray. Well worth the visit.",
          "The Jokhang Temple is the first one in Tibet and was founded in the C7th. Outside the entrance you may well see members of the public prostrating themselves in respect to Buddha. There is a nominal entrance fee, but once inside you can meander through the various rooms and enjoy",
          "I\u2019ve learned that having a knowledgable and cultured tour guide makes the experiences here in Lhasa and Tibet extremely important and our local Tibetan tour guide arranged through agency \u201cExplore Tibet\u201d helped us to have an amazing day and educational visit at Jokhang Temple",
          "Went there on Saturday morning and it was packed with locals praying and tourists visiting the beautiful temple. The Jokhang temple, considered the \u201cspiritual heart of the city\u201d and the most sacred in Tibet, is at the center of an ancient network of Buddhist temples in Lhasa. It",
          "This 8th Century Temple boasts Nepalese and Indian influences, the temple attracts pilgrims daily. It is a temple that houses 3000 icons of the Buddha, deities and histroical figures.",
          "Our visit consisted of a shuffle around through the crowds. Actually the least enjoyable temple visit of our trip as no opportunity to properly view or experience what was going on.",
          "Impressive temple in the heart of Lhasa. From the outside you can see the fervor of pilgrims bowing to their religion, from the inside you can feel the fervor of the people who built spaces.",
          "Although not truly unique or remarkable as far as architecture or the interior temples, this is still the holy site which is at the center of the Barkhor Street loop. There is a large plaza at the front with tall \"Victory\" poles. There is a constant crowd of worshippers praying",
          "This is the holiest site in Tibet- its the most incredible of experiences- if you are fortunate to take that once in a lifetime trip to Tibet you really mustn't miss the Jokhang and the Barkhor- the essence of Tibet",
          "Welcomed by the smell of smouldering sage and juniper at the entrance, this is very much a working temple with many worshippers inside and out paying their respects and praying. 7th Century temple with lots of interesting history attached",
          "Refer to my review of Tibet Travellers, whom we use. This is an absolutely amazing place, whilst I'm not religious, the devoutness of the people really moved me. If I have to pick a favourite place in Lhasa, this is it.",
          "Very crowded today- Tuesday-we saw the Dali Llama\u2019s living quarters and his throne before he left for India in 1959. The 2,500 old Buddha from China\u2019s princess in the 6 or 7th century made of gold - people would pass by and make a wish. One of the oldest temples in Tibet.",
          "Wonderful experience inside and out. Read the other reviews; not much else to say. The downside is all the incense smoke inside and out (it smells like a forest fire, not perfumed American incense). I have sinus problems and the smoke made me miserable. My wife wore a surgical",
          "The Holy temple -Jokhang is our main visit point in our this private tour, truly offer us a passionate trip with local tour guide",
          "Jokhang temple as per Tibetans is the holiest site in entire Tibet for Buddhists. It is a beautiful temple, I saw more gold in this temple than any other site barring Golden Temple in Amritsar India. The story is that local Tibetans keep donating gold to millennia old child",

          "During a Lhasa Trip, visiting the oldest temple of Tibet is a must do! The Temple in the Middle of the oldtown and you will see lots of pilgrims in Front of the temple day by day. The Temple ist Really nice from inside, you will see a Lot of important rooms and Places, which",
          "This temple is a must see. It is in the city center and crowded but worth visiting. It has beautiful figures of Buddha and stupas. It gives one an insight into the Tibetan way of life and the simplicity and openness of the people of Tibet.",
          "The oldest temple in Tibet, bustling with activity and situated in Bakhor Street area. Here, you can see many faithful Tibetans in their prayers and walking the Qora, which has to be completed in odd numbers. Not too physically taxing as it is only 2 storeys high. But may be",
          "Walking around and inside the Jokhang brings you to one of the holiest places and experience of the Tibetan Buddhism. Unique in itself and unforgettable.",
          "The Jokhang temple is a beautiful experience of Tibetan Buddhist History. One can see typical architecture, the important icons and the devout fervor of the Tibetans.",

        "wiki": "Lhasa or Chengguan is a district and administrative capital of Lhasa City in the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. The inner urban area of Lhasa City is equivalent to the administrative borders of Chengguan District, which is part of the wider prefectural Lhasa City.\nLhasa is the second most populous urban area on the Tibetan Plateau after Xining and, at an altitude of 3,656 metres (11,990 ft), Lhasa is one of the highest cities in the world.  The city has been the religious and administrative capital of Tibet since the mid-17th century. It contains many culturally significant Tibetan Buddhist sites such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka Palaces.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nLhasa literally translates to \"place of gods\" (\u0f63\u0fb7 lha, god; \u0f66 sa, place) in the Tibetan language. Chengguan literally translates to \"urban gateway\" (Chinese: \u57ce\u5173; pinyin: Ch\u00e9nggu\u0101n) in the Chinese language. Ancient Tibetan documents and inscriptions demonstrate that the place was called Rasa (\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66), which either meant \"goats' place\", or, as a contraction of rawe sa, a \"place surrounded by a wall,\" or 'enclosure', suggesting that the site was originally a hunting preserve within the royal residence on Marpori Hill. Lhasa is first recorded as the name, referring to the area's temple of Jowo, in a treaty drawn up between China and Tibet in 822 C.E.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBy the mid 7th century, Songtsen Gampo became the leader of the Tibetan Empire that had risen to power in the Brahmaputra River (locally known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River) Valley. After conquering the kingdom of Zhangzhung in the west, he moved the capital from the Chingwa Takts\u00e9 Castle in Chongye County (pinyin: Qi\u00f3ngji\u00e9 Xi\u00e0n), southwest of Yarlung, to Rasa (Lhasa) where in 637 he raised the first structures on the site of what is now the Potala Palace on Mount Marpori.\nIn CE 639 and 641, Songtsen Gampo, who by this time had conquered the whole Tibetan region, is said to have contracted two alliance marriages,  firstly to a Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal, and then, two years later, to Princess Wencheng of the Imperial Tang court. Bhrikuti is said to have converted him to Buddhism, which was also the faith attributed to his second wife Wencheng. In 641 he constructed the Jokhang (or Rasa Tr\u00fclnang Tsulagkhang) and Ramoche Temples in Lhasa in order to house two Buddha statues, the Akshobhya Vajra (depicting the Buddha at the age of eight) and the Jowo Sakyamuni (depicting Buddha at the age of twelve), respectively brought to his court by the princesses.  Lhasa suffered extensive damage under the reign of Langdarma in the 9th century, when the sacred sites were destroyed and desecrated and the empire fragmented.A Tibetan tradition mentions that after Songtsen Gampo's death in 649 C.E., Chinese troops captured Lhasa and burnt the Red Palace. Chinese and Tibetan scholars have noted that the event is mentioned neither in the Chinese annals nor in the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang. L\u01d0 suggested that this tradition may derive from an interpolation. Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa believes that \"those histories reporting the arrival of Chinese troops are not correct.\"From the fall of the monarchy in the 9th century to the accession of the 5th Dalai Lama, the centre of political power in the Tibetan region was not situated in Lhasa. However, the importance of Lhasa as a religious site became increasingly significant as the centuries progressed. It was known as the centre of Tibet where Padmasambhava magically pinned down the earth demoness and built the foundation of the Jokhang Temple over her heart. Islam has been present since the 11th century in what is considered to have always been a monolithically Buddhist culture. Two Tibetan Muslim communities have lived in Lhasa with distinct homes, food and clothing, language, education, trade and traditional herbal medicine.\nBy the 15th century, the city of Lhasa had risen to prominence following the founding of three large Gelugpa monasteries by Je Tsongkhapa and his disciples. The three monasteries are Ganden, Sera and Drepung which were built as part of the puritanical Buddhist revival in Tibet. The scholarly achievements and political know-how of this Gelugpa Lineage eventually pushed Lhasa once more to centre stage.\nThe 5th Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso (1617\u20131682), unified Tibet and moved the centre of his administration to Lhasa in 1642 with the help of G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut. With G\u00fcshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. The core leadership of this government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, and Lhasa thereafter became both the religious and political capital. In 1645, the reconstruction of the Potala Palace began on Red Hill. In 1648, the Potrang Karpo (White Palace) of the Potala was completed, and the Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time onwards. The Potrang Marpo (Red Palace) was added between 1690 and 1694. The name Potala is derived from Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the Dalai Lama's divine prototype, the Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. The Jokhang Temple was also greatly expanded around this time. Although some wooden carvings and lintels of the Jokhang Temple date to the 7th century, the oldest of Lhasa's extant buildings, such as within the Potala Palace, the Jokhang and some of the monasteries and properties in the Old Quarter date to this second flowering in Lhasa's history.\nBy the end of the 17th century, Lhasa's Barkhor area formed a bustling market for foreign goods. The Jesuit missionary, Ippolito Desideri reported in 1716 that the city had a cosmopolitan community of Mongol, Chinese, Muscovite, Armenian, Kashmiri, Nepalese and Northern Indian traders. Tibet was exporting musk, gold, medicinal plants, furs and yak tails to far-flung markets, in exchange for sugar, tea, saffron, Persian turquoise, European amber and Mediterranean coral. The Qing dynasty army entered Lhasa in 1720, and the Qing government sent resident commissioners, called the Ambans, to Lhasa. In November 11 of 1750, the murder of the regent by the Ambans triggered a riot in the city that left more than a hundred people killed, including the Ambans. After suppressing the rebels, Qing Qianlong Emperor reorganized the Tibetan government and set up the governing council called Kashag in Lhasa in 1751. \n\nIn 1904 a British expedition force led by Francis Younghusband entered Lhasa and forced remaining low-level Tibetan officials to sign the Treaty of Lhasa after the fleeing of Dalai Lama. The treaty was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 Anglo-Chinese treaty. All Qing troops left Lhasa after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1912.\nBy the 20th century, Lhasa, long a beacon for both Tibetan and foreign Buddhists, had numerous ethnically and religiously distinct communities, among them Kashmiri Muslims, Ladakhi merchants, Sikh converts to Islam, and Chinese traders and officials. The Kashmiri Muslims (Khache) trace their arrival in Lhasa to the Muslim saint of Patna, Khair ud-Din, contemporary with the 5th Dalai Lama. Chinese Muslims lived in a quarter to the south, and Newar merchants from Kathmandu to the north of the Barkhor market. Residents of the Lubu neighbourhood were descended from Chinese vegetable farmers who stayed over after accompanying an Amban from Sichuan in the mid-nineteenth century; some later intermarried with Tibetan women and spoke Tibetan as their first language.  The city's merchants catered to all kinds of tastes, importing even Australian butter and British whisky. In the 1940s, according to Heinrich Harrer:-\n\n'There is nothing one cannot buy, or at least order. One even finds the Elizabeth Arden  specialties, and there is a keen demand for them. . .You can order, too, sewing machines, radio sets and gramophones and hunt up Bing Crosby records.' After the establishment of Communist Chinese People's Republic of China, \"(...) the People's Liberation Army (PLA) invaded the country in 1950. In March 1959, an uprising centered on the capital, Lhasa, prompted a massive crackdown, during which the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso (b. 1935), fled into exile.\" Such markets and consumerism came to an abrupt end after the arrival of Chinese government troops and administrative cadres in 1950.  Food rations and poorly stocked government stores replaced the old markets, until the 1990s when commerce in international wares once more returned to Lhasa, and arcades and malls with a cornucopia of goods sprang up.Of the 22 parks (lingkas) which surrounded the city of Lhasa, most of them over half a mile in length, where the people of Lhasa were accustomed to picnic, only three survive today: the Norbulingka, Dalai Lama's Summer Palace, constructed by the 7th Dalai Lama; a small part of the Shugtri Lingka, and the Lukhang. Dormitory blocks, offices and army barracks are built over the rest.\n\nThe Gu\u0101nd\u00ec mi\u00e0o (\u95dc\u5e1d\u5edf) or Gesar Lhakhang temple was erected by the Amban in 1792 atop Mount Bamare 3 kilometres (2 miles) south of the Potala to celebrate the defeat of an invading Gurkha army.The main gate to the city of Lhasa used to run through the large Pargo Kaling chorten and contained holy relics of the Buddha Mindukpa.Between 1987\u20131989 Lhasa experienced major demonstrations, led by monks and nuns, against the Chinese Government. After Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Lhasa was mandated by the government to undergo economic liberalization. All government employees, their families and students were forbidden from practicing their religion, while monks and nuns were not allowed to enter government offices and the Tibet University campus. Subsequent to the introduction of the economic development policies, the influx of migrants has dramatically altered the city's ethnic mix in Lhasa.In 2000 the urbanised area covered 53 square kilometres (20 sq mi), with a population of around 170,000. Official statistics of the metropolitan area report that 70 percent are Tibetan, 34.3 are Han, and the remaining 2.7 Hui, though outside observers suspect that non-Tibetans account for some 50\u201370 percent. Among the Han immigrants, Lhasa is known as 'Little Sichuan'.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLhasa has an elevation of about 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and lies in the centre of the Tibetan Plateau with the surrounding mountains rising to 5,500 m (18,000 ft). The air only contains 68 percent of the oxygen compared to sea level. The Lhasa River, also Kyi River or Kyi Chu, a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Brahmaputra River), runs through the southern part of the city. This river, known to local Tibetans as the \"merry blue waves\", flows through the snow-covered peaks and gullies of the Nyainq\u00eantanglha mountains, extending 315 km (196 mi), and emptying into the Yarlung Zangbo River at Q\u00fcx\u00fc, forms an area of great scenic beauty. The marshlands, mostly uninhabited, are to the north. Ingress and egress roads run east and west, while to the north, the road infrastructure is less developed.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nChengguan District is located on the middle reaches of the Lhasa River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River, with land that rises to the north and south of the river.\nIt is 28 kilometres (17 mi) from east to west and 31 kilometres (19 mi) from north to south.\nChengguan District is bordered by Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District to the west, Dagz\u00ea County to the east and Lh\u00fcnzhub County to the north. \nGonggar County of Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture lies to the south.Chengguan District has an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) and covers 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi).\nThe urban built-up area covers 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi).\nThe average annual temperature of 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F).\nAnnual precipitation is about 500 millimetres (20 in), mostly falling between July and September.The term \"Chengguan District\" is the administrative term for the inner urban area or the urban centre within a prefecture, in this case the Prefectural-city of Lhasa. Outside of the urban area much of Chengguan District is mainly mountainous with a near nonexistent rural population.\nChengguan District is at the same administrative level as a county.\nChengguan District of Lhasa was established on 23 April 1961. \nIt currently has 12 fully urban subdistricts.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDue to its very high elevation, Lhasa has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk) with frosty winters and mild summers, yet the valley location protects the city from intense cold or heat and strong winds. Monthly possible sunshine ranges from 53 percent in July to 84 percent in November, and the city receives nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight annually. It is thus sometimes called the \"sunlit city\" by Tibetans. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of \u22121.6 \u00b0C (29.1 \u00b0F) and the warmest month is June with a daily average of 16.0 \u00b0C (60.8 \u00b0F), though nights have generally been warmer in July. The annual mean temperature is 7.98 \u00b0C (46.4 \u00b0F), with extreme temperatures ranging from \u221216.5 to 30.4 \u00b0C (2 to 87 \u00b0F). Lhasa has an annual precipitation of 426 millimetres (16.8 in) with rain falling mainly in July, August and September. The driest month is January at 0.8 millimetres (0.03 in) and the wettest month is August, at 120.6 millimetres (4.75 in). The rainy season is widely regarded the \"best\" of the year as rains come mostly at night and Lhasa is still sunny during the daytime.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Demographics in the past ===\nThe 11th edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica published between 1910\u20131911 noted the total population of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity was about 30,000; a census in 1854 made the figure 42,000, but it is known to have greatly decreased since. Britannica noted that within Lhasa, there were about a total of 1,500 resident Tibetan laymen and about 5,500 Tibetan women. The permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000). The city's residents included traders from Nepal and Ladak (about 800), and a few from Bhutan, Mongolia and other places. The Britannica noted with interest that the Chinese had a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended carefully after their manner and that the Nepalese supplied mechanics and metal-workers at that time.In the first half of the 20th century, several Western explorers made celebrated journeys to the city, including William Montgomery McGovern, Francis Younghusband, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, and Heinrich Harrer. Lhasa was the centre of Tibetan Buddhism as nearly half of its population were monks, Though this figure may include monks from surrounding monasteries who travelled to Lhasa for various celebrations and were not ordinarily resident there.\nThe majority of the pre-1950 Chinese population of Lhasa were merchants and officials. In the Lubu section of Lhasa, the inhabitants were descendants of Chinese vegetable farmers, some of whom married Tibetan wives. They came to Lhasa in the 1840s\u20131860s after a Chinese official was appointed to the position of Amban.According to one writer, the population of the city was about 10,000, with some 10,000 monks at Drepung and Sera monasteries in 1959. Hugh Richardson, on the other hand, puts the population of Lhasa in 1952, at \"some 25,000\u201330,000\u2014about 45,000\u201350,000 if the population of the great monasteries on its outskirts be included.\"\n\n\n=== Contemporary demographics ===\nThe total population of Lhasa Prefecture-level City is 521,500 (including known migrant population but excluding military garrisons). Of this, 257,400 are in the urban area (including a migrant population of 100,700), while 264,100 are outside. Nearly half of Lhasa Prefecture-level City's population lives in Chengguan District, which is the administrative division that contains the urban area of Lhasa (i.e. the actual city).\nThe urban area is populated by ethnic Tibetans, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups.\nThe 2000 official census gave a total population of 223,001, of which 171,719 lived in the areas administered by city street offices and city neighborhood committees. \n133,603 had urban registrations and 86,395 had rural registrations, based on their place of origin.\nThe census was taken in November, when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet, and did not count the military.\nA 2011 book estimated that up to two-thirds of the city's residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District as a whole is still 63% ethnic Tibetan. As of 2014, half of Tibet's Han population resided in Chengguan District of Lhasa, where bilingual or wholly Chinese teaching was common in the schools.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCompetitive industry together with feature economy play key roles in the development of Lhasa. With the view to maintaining a balance between population growth and the environment, tourism and service industries are emphasised as growth engines for the future.\nMany of Lhasa's rural residents practice traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Lhasa is also the traditional hub of the Tibetan trading network. For many years, chemical and car making plants operated in the area and this resulted in significant pollution, a factor which has changed in recent years. Copper, lead and zinc are mined nearby and there is ongoing experimentation regarding new methods of mineral mining and geothermal heat extraction.\nAgriculture and animal husbandry in Lhasa are considered to be of a high standard. People mainly plant highland barley and winter wheat. The resources of water conservancy, geothermal heating, solar energy and various mines are abundant. There is widespread electricity together with the use of both machinery and traditional methods in the production of such things as textiles, leathers, plastics, matches and embroidery. The production of national handicrafts has made great progress.\n\nWith the growth of tourism and service sectors, the sunset industries which cause serious pollution are expected to fade in the hope of building a healthy ecological system. Environmental problems such as soil erosion, acidification, and loss of vegetation are being addressed. The tourism industry now brings significant business to the region, building on the attractiveness of the Potala Palace, the Jokang, the Norbulingka Summer Palace and surrounding large monasteries as well the spectacular Himalayan landscape together with the many wild plants and animals native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. Tourism to Tibet dropped sharply following the crackdown on protests in 2008, but as early as 2009, the industry was recovering. Chinese authorities plan an ambitious growth of tourism in the region aiming at 10 million visitors by 2020; these visitors are expected to be domestic. With renovation around historic sites, such as the Potala Palace, UNESCO has expressed \"concerns about the deterioration of Lhasa's traditional cityscape.\"\n\nLhasa contains several hotels. Lhasa Hotel is a 4-star hotel located northeast of Norbulingka in the western suburbs of the city. Completed in September 1985, it is the flagship of CITS's installations in Tibet. It accommodates about 1000 guests and visitors to Lhasa. There are over 450 rooms (suites) in the hotel, and all are equipped with air conditioning, mini-bar and other basic facilities. Some of the rooms are decorated in traditional Tibetan style. The hotel was operated by Holiday Inn from 1986 to 1997 and is the subject of a book, The Hotel on the Roof of the World. Another hotel of note is the historical Banak Sh\u00f6l Hotel,  located at 8 Beijing Road in the city. It is known for its distinctive wooden verandas. The Nam-tso Restaurant is located in the vicinity of the hotel and is frequented especially by Chinese tourists visiting Lhasa.\nLhasa contains several businesses of note. Lhasa Carpet Factory,  a factory south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University, produces traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide. It is a modern factory, the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet, employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, and men the spinners, but both work on the rugs today.\nThe Lhasa Brewery Company was established in 1988 on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, south of Sera Monastery and is the highest commercial brewery in the world at 11,975 feet (3,650 m) and accounts for 85 percent of contemporary beer production in Tibet. The brewery, consisting of five-story buildings, cost an estimated US$20\u201325 million, and by 1994, production had reached 30,000 bottles per day, employing some 200 workers by this time. Since 2000, the Carlsberg group has increased its stronghold in the Chinese market and has become increasingly influential in the country with investment and expertise. Carlsberg invested in the Lhasa Brewery in recent years and has drastically improved the brewing facility and working conditions, renovating and expanding the building to what now covers 62,240 square metres (15.3 acres).\n\n\n== Architecture and cityscape ==\n\nLhasa has many sites of historic interest, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Sera Monastery and Norbulingka. The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and the Norbulingka are UNESCO world heritage sites. However, many important sites were damaged or destroyed mostly, but not solely, during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Many have been restored since the 1980s.\nThe Potala Palace, named after Mount Potala, the abode of Chenresig or Avalokitesvara, was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama. After the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the government converted the palace into a museum. The site was used as a meditation retreat by King Songtsen Gampo, who in 637 built the first palace there in order to greet his bride Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang dynasty of China. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (d. 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The palace underwent restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million) and was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994.\n\nThe Lhasa Zhol Pillar, below the Potala, dates as far back as circa 764 CE. and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing. The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in 763 CE during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.\n\nChokpori, meaning  'Iron Mountain',  is a sacred hill, located south of the Potala. It is considered to be one of the four holy mountains of central Tibet and along with two other hills in Lhasa represent the \"Three Protectors of Tibet.\", Chokpori (Vajrapani), Pongwari (Manjushri), and Marpori (Chenresig or Avalokiteshvara). It was the site of the most famous medical school Tibet, known as the Mentsikhang, which was founded in 1413. It was conceived of by Lobsang Gyatso, the \"Great\" 5th Dalai Lama, and completed by the Regent Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho) shortly before 1697.\nLingkhor is a sacred path, most commonly used to name the outer pilgrim road in Lhasa matching its inner twin, Barkhor. The Lingkhor in Lhasa was 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) long enclosing Old Lhasa, the Potala and Chokpori hill. In former times it was crowded with men and women covering its length in prostrations, beggars and pilgrims approaching the city for the first time. The road passed through willow-shaded parks where the Tibetans used to picnic in summer and watch open air operas on festival days. New Lhasa has obliterated most of Lingkhor, but one stretch still remains west of Chokpori.\n\nThe Norbulingka palace and surrounding park is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace and with an area of around 36 hectares (89 acres), it is considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet.\nIt was built from 1755. and served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas until the 14th's self-imposed exile. Norbulingka was declared a 'National Important Cultural Relic Unit\", in 1988 by the State council.  In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. The Sho Dun Festival (popularly known as the \"yogurt festival\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka during the seventh Tibetan month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar.\nThe Barkhor is an area of narrow streets and a public square in the old part of the city located around Jokhang Temple and was the most popular devotional circumambulation for pilgrims and locals. The walk was about one kilometre (0.6 miles) long and encircled the entire Jokhang, the former seat of the State Oracle in Lhasa called the Muru Nyingba Monastery, and a number of nobles' houses including Tromzikhang and Jamkhang. There were four large incense burners (sangkangs) in the four cardinal directions, with incense burning constantly, to please the gods protecting the Jokhang. Most of the old streets and buildings have been demolished in recent times and replaced with wider streets and new buildings. Some buildings in the Barkhor were damaged in the 2008 unrest.\n\nThe Jokhang is located on Barkhor Square in the old town section of Lhasa.  For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. Along with the Potala Palace, it is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Lhasa. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace,\" and a spiritual centre of Lhasa. This temple has remained a key center of Buddhist pilgrimage for centuries. The circumambulation route is known as the \"kora\" in Tibetan and is marked by four large stone incense burners placed at the corners of the temple complex.  The Jokhang temple is a four-story construction, with roofs covered with gilded bronze tiles. The architectural style is based on the Indian vihara design, and was later extended resulting in a blend of Nepalese and Tang dynasty styles. It possesses the statues of Chenresig, Padmasambhava and King Songtsan Gampo and his two foreign brides, Princess Wen Cheng (niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang) and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and other important items.\nRamoche Temple  is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwest of the city, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang, covering a total area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). The temple was gutted and partially destroyed in the 1960s and its famous bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. They have now been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993. Following the major restoration of 1986, the main building in the temple now has three stories.\n\nThe Tibet Museum in Lhasa is the official museum of the Tibet Autonomous Region and was inaugurated on October 5, 1999. It is the first large, modern museum in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has a permanent collection of around 1000 artefacts, from examples of Tibetan art to architectural design throughout history such as Tibetan doors and construction beams. It is located in an L-shaped building west of the Potala Palace on the corner of Norbulingkha Road. The museum is organized into three main sections: a main exhibition hall, a folk cultural garden and administrative offices.The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was unveiled in the Potala Square in May 2002 to celebrate the 51st anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the work in the development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high concrete monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and its name is engraved with the calligraphy of former president Jiang Zemin, while an inscription describes the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThere are some night spots that feature cabaret acts in which performers sing in Chinese, Tibetan, and English. Dancers wear traditional Tibetan costume with long flowing cloth extending from their arms. There are a number of small bars that feature live music, although they typically have limited drink menus and cater mostly to foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Tibet University ===\nTibet University (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f97\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb2\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7a\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b) is the main university of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Its campus is in Chengguan District, Lhasa, east of the city-centre. A forerunner was created in 1952 and the university was officially established in 1985, funded by the Chinese government. About 8000 students are enrolled at the university.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nLhasa has been served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway opened for passenger operations. Reaching an elevation of 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some 2,000 km (1,200 mi) away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. Train number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of passenger, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigaz\u00ea, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.For onward rail travel in South Asia, the closest major station in India is New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri in West Bengal.  However, extension of the Indian railway system to Sikkim will make it easier for onward connections through the South Asian railway network. There are preliminary plans to link Lhasa by rail with Kathmandu.As per a Chinese Tibetan spokesperson, extension of this rail line to Kathmandu with tunneling under Mount Everest is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLhasa Gonggar Airport (IATA: LXA), built in 1965, is the aviation hub of Tibet. It is located south of the city proper. It takes around half an hour to get there by car via the Lhasa Airport Expressway; prior to the completion of the expressway in 2011, the trip to the airport took over an hour. As of 2014, there are daily flights serving major Chinese cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, and there are also occasional scheduled services to Kathmandu in Nepal. Lhasa Airport is the hub of Tibet Airlines, which offers regional services to other destinations in Tibet such as Nyingchi, Ngari Prefecture, Shigatse, and Qamdo.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe Qinghai\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G109) runs northeast toward Xining and eventually to Beijing and is the most-used road in Tibet. The Sichuan\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G318) runs east towards Chengdu and eventually to Shanghai. G318 also runs west to Zhangmu on the Nepal border. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (G219) runs north from Lhasa to Yecheng, and then to Xinjiang. This road is rarely used due to the lack of amenities and petrol stations. A new 37.68 kilometres (23.41 mi), four-lane highway between Lhasa and the Gonggar Airport was built by the Transportation Department of Tibet at a cost of RMB 1.5 billion. This road is part of National Highway 318 and starts from the Lhasa railway station, passes through Caina Township in Qushui County, terminating between the north entrance of the Gala Mountain Tunnel and the south bridgehead of the Lhasa River Bridge, and en route goes over the first overpass of Lhasa at Liuwu Overpass.\n\n\n=== Maritime ===\nThe closest seaports are Kolkata and Haldia in West Bengal, India. The Nathu La pass offers Chinese companies access to the port of Kolkata (Calcutta), situated about 1,100 km (680 mi) from Lhasa, for transshipments to and from Tibet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Lhasa Stadium, which has a capacity of 20,000, is located in Lhasa. It is used mostly for football matches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nMcLeod Ganj\nLeh, India\nMustang, Nepal\nDrapchi Prison or Lhasa Prison No.1\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDesideri (1932).

          "Really enjoyed this place. I realised in visiting that I did not really have a good thorough understanding of Tibetan people and their plight, visiting this museam certainly contained a lot of information regarding Tibetan struggles and filled in all the black spaces for me,",
          "Tibet Museum is one of the biggest propaganda tools of the Chinese government. Their objective of establishing this museum is to give a wrong interpretation of Tibetan history. if they are really interested in the preservation of Tibetan art and culture than why they destroy",
          "Tried to go see this museum but discovered it has been closed for \"renovations\"for two years with no estimated opening date. I was unable to find a alternative with similar exhibits. Unfortunate.",
          "The museum is rich in history, and the three level is the special exhibition and temporary exhibition of Thangka, animals and plants, jade and so on. The exhibition is in Tibet. So it must take time and energy to achieve great results.",
          "I went to this museum and there was a poster that says it is under renovation. Don\u2019t visit until further notice. However, you can visit Norbulingka summer palace/park which is just across.",
          "it is free and lots of real history. worth a trip for those needs to know more what dynasty active in Tibet",
          "This museum is well done. Information plaques are also in English so no interpreter is needed. Be aware the history is from Beijing's viewpoint and is politically slanted. Many artifacts are on display but one is not sure what is original or a reproduction.",
          "Interesting artifacts and great to see on a hot or rainy day. Doesn't take too long to do but you will get a great feel of the Tibetan lifestyle and traditions.",
          "It has always seemed difficult to wonder how people can live in such a high altitude and wild land. It is practically impossible to grow any kind of vegetable apart from barley and potatoes, so it is amazing to discover that there were people living there from the paleolithic",
          "This museum is worth a visit. However there are so many replicas there. You're not sure which one is real stuff, and which one is a replica.",
          "And be prepared to read/listen between the lines. There are many aspects that may be up for debate but the museum does provide both ancient history and a fascinating view of the recent history. Just remember that it portrays one point of view of the events, not necessarily all",
          "The art in this museum is wonderful. However, you will have to put up with the BS that Tibet Art is wonderful, but improved with connections to China, and finally met is full potential when China became Communist and returned Tibet to the fold.",

          "We were given only 40 mins by our tour guide to explore the museum which is very short. So we did'nt really go through all the sections. We only managed to cover the thangkas, statues sections. Should spent more time exploring the place.",
          "The most interesting items to me were the Tibetan costume displays. Nice museum, inside and out. Nice views from the steps. Typical museum artifacts.",
          "Spent 2 hours , lots of history of the people, dress, and artifacts relating to the culture and influence of buddhism. A must see stop. The artifacts well kept and from all over the tibet region. Learned alot about the tibet people and culture",
          "The artefacts are really beautiful and they should be seen if you have a couple of hours spare in Lhasa. Unfortunately, the museum is used as a propaganda tool and the explanation on history are best ignored.",
          "On the day of arrival, it was heavy rain, so the best place to begin with is the museum. It kind of a good storytelling style of display. How and why it became Tibet, a part of China today. Don't think too much about propaganda, just learn what they want to tell you, that's",
          "Please know that when you visit this museum, much of the history is told from the Chinese government's point of view. They present the invasion into Tibet as a \"liberation\" of Tibet. Be sure to read an accurate history before you expose yourself to this version of the events.",
          "I can take or leave museums depending on how much interest they create. This one was a mixture of (to me) reasonably boring bits and some interesting parts. I wasn't too interested in the formal exhibits of rocks and implements but found the visual sections, eg- the model of",
          "Go to see older historical items but don't go for an honest history lesson. Chinese propaganda at its finest and some history is completely inaccurate. Will never go back.",
          "Very nice museum. Entrance was free of charge when I visited it. It is not very big, but you can spend about an hour wtching tibetan artifacts, arts and know some from the history of Tibet. It is situated near the Norbulingka, so you can visit it before or after the Lama's",
          "Not a modern museum with video or audio aids but I do like it. It shows rich history of Tibet. What amazed me were the many imperial documents & decrees being written in 2 or more languages, such as Chinese and Tibetan or Chinese with Mongolian, etc. So multi-lingualism was",

          "This is a decent place to visit if you skip the political wing. It is small and can easily be covered in an hour or so. Not a lot of context is given for the displays and labeling is less than adequate. Good for a rainy day but be aware that there is no heat. It was very",

          "Cultural history of Tibet, as told by the Chinese. Wonderful collection of jade. Museum is small, an hour is probably enough time.",
          "The museum contains an exhibit that covers the history of what's now called Tibet, going back to Neolithic times. As the exhibit passes the Tang Dynasty period you'll start to notice the case being made that Tibet has always been part of China, due to this reason and that",
          "well build museum but could be skipped. It was included in our PRIVATE itinerary and I wish I knew and requested to skip it.",
          "I thought there was lots to see here, and that the visit was well worth the time. Expansive exhibits of textiles, musical instruments, traditional medicine. Supposedly, there is also a house and kitchen exhibit, but I missed it somehow. Lots of jade, ceramics, and Neolithic",
          "This is a small but very complete museum dealing with Tibetan history and culture. There are displays of books, sculpture,art as well as clothing from thousands of years ago.",
          "If you have a lot of time in Lhasa and you've had enough of the temples/monasteries, this museum is worth a visit. It has some good Tibetan artefacts, but also provides an explanation why Tibet should be part of China ... here you need a good knowledge of the history/politics to",
          "Every province in China has a museum featuring that province's history, and Tibet is no exception. And every provincial museum in China sooner or later has a special exhibit of Tibetan artifacts. But this has the most complete collection of Tibetan artifacts anywhere. There are",
          "Read the Chinese propoganda carefully. It is a fascinating view of why the Chinese think it is ok to occupy Tibet. The museum is very well done and has lovely displaces.",

          "Had I not known better I would have thought from this museum that Tibet was a part of Tibet for 2,000 years. This museum is rewriting of Tibetan history at its extreme. Everything is told from China's perspective -- all biased and unnecessary.",
          "If you can get past the re-writing of local history this Museum is quite a good with plenty to see and experience. I preferred the new Yak Museum on the outside of town but there are still some beautiful artifacts and religious and cultural treasures.",
          "Very typical of most museums in China/Asia in that it's comprehensivity is rather lacking. There is a definite slant towards the impact of China and importance of China to Tibet rather than Tibet's own self-reliance. Typical displays of Chinese chops, pottery, Jade and",
          "In just an hour or two a visit to this place will give you a good overview of the country of Tibet. The design and displays are exceptionally well done and world class.",
          "This is a new museum and the current exhibits are okay, but they need to do more. Compared to, say, the Chongqing museum, this is very limited. Not really worth it in my opinion, but it might get better as more money spent.",
          "they try...but the place is pretty empty and devoid of good content beyond some ancient artifacts. Of course, nothing of Tibet's true history is there since it is a miltarily occupied country by China. Skip this place, spend more time at the monasteries and Buddhist sites.",
          "This newish museum presents the history, ethnography, and art of Tibet very well. It is worth the visit.",
          "This museum packs a lot more punch than it looks from the outside. They have an amazing collection of jade, golden Buddhas, thangkas, Chinese porcelain, bronze, textiles, and many other things. This was my favorite museum in China -- small, quiet, intimate. Excellent gift",

          "There are quite a lot of artifacts and displays of tibetan history here, as well a a video presentation on Tibetan life. If you are travelling with a tour group, You will probably be taken here. Much of the merchandise at the shop is very overpriced, if you want a souvenier you",
          "It's free and has extensive exhibition on Tibetian culture and history. I would strongly recommend visiting this museum before going to any Tibetian historic/cultural sites.",
          "This is a really nice museum with many wonderful examples of the history of Tibet. Many of the descriptions include English translations. I wish we had more time to visit. We are traveling as part of a group tour and that of course means time limits. I do feel we saw a good deal",
          "This museum is for free and it is worth a visit. It tells you about the origins of tibet and about the tibetans, their culture, their clothes etc. Furthermore there is jade and a porcelain exhibition. And since this museum is opposite the summer palace, you might as well see",
          "This wonderful collection of artefacts has one very obvious political purpose: convince the visitor that \"Tibet has always been part of China.\" Once one accepts this, it is easy to enjoy oneself gazing at the best collection of Tibetan cultural works of art in Tibet. Our guide",
          "A very worth while visit when in Lhasa! I wish I would have had more time. I loved the cultural costume exhibits and the time line overview of the history of the Tibetan people.",
          "I had spent several weeks in China, and almost a week in Tibet, was very tired, and not impressed after everything else. There is so much in the Potala Palace, monasteries, and temples. Maybe its a good plan to go here first. Almost no stairs, and it is more interesting if",
          "This museum was very nice and had enough English to understand what was involved. It had many Tibetan artifacts including Tibetan clothing styles over the history of Tibet and had some wonderfully colorful and interesting Tibetan drama masks. Every mask had a human skull on it",
          "The history section of the first room is as expected... then the beautiful objects, particularly the buddhist sculptures and the explanations of the regional influences is highly recommended. The Tibet video in the final room is spectacular too.",
          "The museum is large and beautiful. There are lots of historical items to view. The textiles and jade carvings were amazing.",
          "This museum is outstanding. It is very professional and I wished I had much more time to spend there.",
          "Some really fabulous relics that date back 1500 years but the real experience for me was inside the interactive section of the museum where you see into the real lives of Tibetans and how they live in such a hostile but beautiful environment. Well worth the visit.",
          "Well layed out museum with some interesting artifacts and good explanations via audio headsets. This is the history of Tibet from the PRC perspective. Probably would have skipped this had it not been part of tour.",
          "The museum is well put together, and has a good mix of historical artifacts and current cultural items (clothing, equipment, even a nice recreation of a typical dwelling). The video they show at the basement is also enjoyable but also full of one sidedness",
          "Visiting this museum will get to learn more about the history of Tibet. At second floor there are massive displayed items. Free entrance and door close at 17:30 Worth if you have spare time in the city.",
          "The more museum the better it is where we can learn about the people of Tibet or guide from Lhasa Nyima was great",
          "I liked the first floor where they talked about the culture of the people and that they were nomads before the Chinese came and stoleso muc of there culture which was very wrong I like what China did in mainland China but leave the proplr of Tibet to control there own country",
          "I would recommend anyone going to Tibet to pay this place a visit. Worth the while. Well organised and clean. Lcoation is right in the city area too.",
          "The museum displays Tibetan artifacts back from B.C. You can learn Tibet's culture and its relatonship with Chinese government in different stages of history. 1-2 hour of visit should be enough. There's no entrance fee and there's free guide every 30 mins. Guide equipment is",
          "There were some good items in this museum the layout was good but wonder how much of the history was missing. The group I was with were funnelled into a souvenir shop below the museum is was quite vast and the sales people were very abrupt and pushy when it came to sales.",
          "The Tibet Museum was just ok for me. Other parts of Tibet were much more interesting to me. It seemed like the history of Tibet as shown in the museum was more the history of China's influence in Tibet, rather than just Tibetan culture.",
          "It's very easy to get there by bus or even on walk. But I must say that nearly all museums in China are similar. All exhibitions begin from how human being develop and yes it's true that China has so many old things to prove we are a old country. But if you are foreigner you",
          "I enjoyed the exhibits in this museum although the audio guide mechanism is hard to figure out. I kept inadvertently flipping into Japanese and other languages - finally gave up. You definitely get the Chinese version of history and Tibet here. But the jade bowls and statues",

        "wiki": "Sera Monastery (Tibetan: \u0f66\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54, Wylie: se ra dgon pa \"Wild Roses Monastery\"; Chinese: \u8272\u62c9\u5bfa; pinyin: S\u00e8l\u0101 S\u00ec) is one of the \"great three\" Gelug university monasteries of Tibet, located 1.25 miles (2.01 km) north of Lhasa and about 5 km (3.1 mi) north of the Jokhang. The other two are Ganden Monastery and Drepung Monastery. The origin of its name is attributed to a fact that during construction, the hill behind the monastery was covered with blooming wild roses (or \"sera\" in Tibetan).The original Sera Monastery is responsible for some 19 hermitages, including four nunneries, which are all located in the foot hills north of Lhasa.The Sera Monastery, as a complex of structures with the Great Assembly Hall and three colleges, was founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey of Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355\u20131435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa.\nDuring the 1959 revolt in Lhasa, Sera monastery suffered severe damage, with its colleges destroyed and hundreds of monks killed. After the Dalai Lama took asylum in India, many of the monks of Sera who survived the attack moved to Bylakuppe in Mysore, India. After initial tribulations, they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great Assembly Hall on similar lines to the original monastery, with help from the Government of India. There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera, India and this community has also spread its missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres, propagating knowledge of Buddhism.Sera Monastery in Tibet and its counterpart in Mysore, India are noted for their debate sessions.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe original Sera Monastery is a complex of structures founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355\u20131435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa. Prior to establishing this monastery, Tsongkhapa, assisted by his disciples, had set up hermitages at higher elevations above Sera Uts\u00e9 Hermitage.\nThe Sera complex is divided into two sectors by pathways; the eastern part contains the Great Assembly Hall and the dwellings and the western part has the well-known three colleges: the Sera Je Dratsang, the Sera Me Dratsang; and the Ngakpa Dratsang, all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8-70. All the structures within this complex formed a clockwise pilgrimage circuit, starting with the colleges (in the order stated), followed by the hall, the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great Assembly Hall.The J\u00e9 and M\u00e9 colleges were established to train monks, over a 20-year programme of tsennyi mtshan nyid grwa tshang (philosophical knowledge), which concludes with a geshe degree. The Ngakpa college, which predated the other two colleges, was exclusively devoted to the practice of tantric ritual. Before 1959, the administration of each college comprised an abbot with council of ten lamas for each college.Over the years, the monastery developed into a hermitage where about 6000 monks resided. The monastery was one of the finest locations in Tibet to witness the debate sessions, which were held according to a fixed schedule.\nThe monastery belongs to the Gelug Order and was one of the largest in Lhasa. In 2008, Sera had 550 monks in residence.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the monastery is strongly connected to Master Lama Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419), the founder of the Gelukpa Order, the much venerated and highly learned guru in Buddhist scriptures. It was under his divine tutelage that his disciple Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge established the Sera Jey Monastery complex in the early 15th century AD. Kunkhyen Lodroe Rinchen Senge initially served as a teacher in the Drepung Monastery before he formed the Sera Jey. The religious legend narrated for how the site was chosen was a clairvoyant vision that Tsongkhapa had in which he saw the full text of Prajnaparamita's 20 slokas on Shunyata captioned in the sky. This psychic spell gave him a full insight into the Tsawasehrab (Fundamentals of Madhyamika or Shunyata) text. Further, he also perceived the \"vision of a rain like \"AA\" characters descending from the sky\". It was only 12 years later that one of his pupils, Jamchen Choje, fulfilled the prophecy of his guru by establishing the Sera Je as a seat of learning knowledge of the complete teachings and practices of the Mahayana tradition.Providentially, the then King Nedong Dagpa Gyaltsen supported the noble venture with required finances and also, in 1419, performed the foundation laying ceremony for construction of the monastery. Further detailing with regard to the building development including installing sacred images/idols and other objects of worship were completed according to the supreme wishes of great Lama Tsongkhapa. The monastery soon came to be known as \"the Seat of Theckchen ling (Mahayana Tradition)\". Another version for the name 'Sera' that came to be prefixed with 'Monastery' was its location that was surrounded by raspberry shrubs called 'Sewa' in Tibetan, that formed like a 'Rawa' in Tibetan, meaning \"Fence\".\n\n\n=== Post-1959 events ===\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and sought asylum there. During the month of March of the same year the Sera Jey Monastery had been destroyed by bombardment, which resulted in death of hundreds of monks (in 1959, the count of monks living in Sera Jey was 5629), apart from destruction of ancient texts and loss of innumerable, invaluable, ancient and antique works of art. Many of those who survived (monks and common people) this onslaught by the Chinese fled to India, under severe winter weather conditions, across the Himalayas. Following this mass exodus of people from Tibet (including, a few hundred Sera Jey lamas, geshes and monks), when they arrived in India, they were resettled at Bylakuppe near Mysore, Karnataka state among many other locations spread across the country, as one of the exclusive Tibetan establishments with ready assistance forthcoming from the Government of India. It was in 1970 that the group of 197 Sera Jey monks with 103 of Sera Mey monks established a special monastery within the resettlement of Bylakuppe as a counterpart of the Tibetan Sera Jey Monastery. As none of the monks of the Ngagpa Dratsang (Tantric College) had survived the invasion, only the Sera Mey College and Sera Jey College were re-formed in India. The Bylakuppe Monastery now houses 5,000 Buddhist monks comprising some migrants and many other Tibetans who were not born in their ancestral homeland.\n\nWith forest land allotted by the Government of India, two arms of the Sera Monastery, representing the migrant monks of the Tibetan Sera Je and Sera Me colleges were established; 193 Sera je monks got 147.75 acres (59.79 ha) and 107 monks of Sera Me got an allotment of the balance area. Further, 38 tenements were built with grants by the Government of India for the Monks to reside and pursue their vocation of monkshood coupled with tilling the surrounding allotted land for raising food crops for survival. Well established as an organised Monastery with dedicated efforts of the monks, an Assembly Prayer Hall that could accommodate 1500 monks was also completed in 1978. This Monastery is now the nodal monastery, with its affiliation to several smaller monasteries spread across various regions in Tibet; its popularity could be gauged by the 3000 or more monks living here now. Encouraged by this success and noting the pressure on existing infrastructure, an additional, much larger and an impressive Assembly hall (measuring 23,275 square feet (2,162.3 m2), 31 feet (9.4 m) high with 110 pillars) has been built that can accommodate 3500 monks to assemble for prayers. With this development, Sera has now two facets, the original \u201cTibetan Sera\u201d and the Bylakuppe \u201cNew Sera\u201d of the \u201cTibetan Diaspora\u201d with the counterpart J\u00e9, M\u00e9 monasteries, with the Ngakpa college counterpart also added recently. The Sera-India monk community of the Bylakuppe Monastery, has gone global with their missionary activity by establishing \u201cdharma centres\u201d in many parts the world, thus removing the cultural isolation of pre-1959 years in Tibet.Sera, Tibet that housed more than 5,000 monks in 1959, though badly damaged following the invasion of Tibet and the 1959 Revolution, is still functional after restoration. In 2011, according to local sources, there are about 300 monks.  The reason for this decline is attributed to the 2008 Tibetan unrest.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe monastery is located on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. As built in 1419, it encompassed an area of 28 acres (11 ha). Its geographical location is at the base of Pubuchok mountain, also known as Tatipu Hill, located in the northern suburb of Lhasa City, which forms the watershed of the basins formed by Kyi Chi and Penpo Chu rivers.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe monastery complex, encompassing 28 acres (11 ha) of land, housed several institutions in its precincts. The structures of notability were the Coqen Hall Tsokchen (Great Assembly Hall), the three Zhacangs (colleges) and Kamcun (dormitory) also called Homdong Kangtsang. In the main hall, scriptures (scripted with gold powder), statues, scent cloth and murals were seen in profusion. The descriptions given here relate to the scenario that existed at the monastery prior to the 1959 invasion by China but most of the monasteries are stated to be since restored, though the strength of the monks are said to be small.\n\n\n=== Great Assembly Hall ===\n\nThe Great Assembly Hall, the \u2018Tsokchen' or 'Coqen Hall', dated to 1710, a four-story structure to the north east of the monastery, facing east, is where several religious rituals and rites are conducted. The hall measured an area of 2,000 square metres (22,000 sq ft) built with 125 pillars (86 tall and 39 short columns) and was constructed by Lhazang Qan. The entry portico had ten columns. The five chapels in this building have statues or images of Maitreya, Shakyamuni, Arhats, Tsongkhapa, and Kwan-yin with one thousand hands and eleven faces. The ancient and delicately written scriptures \u2018the Gangyur of Tripitaka\u2019 also spelt 'Kangyur' (dated 1410) in 105 volumes (original 108 volumes) written in Tibetan is the treasured possession of the monastery. It is said that Chengzhu, Emperor of the Ming Dynasty presented these scriptures (printed on wood blocks with gold cover engraved in red lacquer and made in China), to Jamchen Chojey, the builder of the monastery.The entrance to the hall was through a portico built on 10 columns. Large appliqu\u00e9 Thangkas were suspended from the ceiling on the side walls. A skylight at the centre provided the light in the hall during the day. Image of the founder of the monastery Jamchen Choje Shakya Yeshe was deified as the central image. Other deities installed were of Maitreya (5 metres (16 ft) height and gilded) flanked by statues of two lions, Dalai Lamas V, VII and XII, Tsongkhapa (with his favourite disciples), Chokyi Gyeltsen, Desi Sangye Gyatso and many more.The three inner chapels, sequentially, are the Jampa Lhakhang, the Neten Lhakhang and Jigje Lhakhang. A 6 metres (20 ft) high image of Maitreya was deified in Jampa Lhakhang ensconced by Eight Bodhisattvas, the treasured Kagyur and guarded by Hayagriva and Acala at the entrance. Jigje Lhakhang houses the image of Bhairava with his consort Bhairavi, Shri Devi and other protector deities.On the second floor, there were three chapels: the Zhelre Lhakhang from where Maitreya could be seen embossed with a small Tsongkhapa on its heart; the Tu-je Chenpo Lhakhang that had an Avalokiteshvara with eleven faces (found at Pawangka), Tara and six\u2013armed Mahakala. The idol of Shakyamuni Buddha flanked by images of Gelukpa Lamas were placed in the Shakyamuni Lhakhang.The third and the fourth floors were used as private apartments for the Dalai Lamas and the preceptors of the Main Assembly Hall.\n\n\n=== Sera Me Tratsang ===\n\nSera Me Tratsang or Sera Me Zhakan was the oldest college built here. It was established in 1419 during the Ming Dynasty reign, initially for elementary or basic education in Buddhist religion. The college adopted a step-by-step approach to the studies of Buddhist doctrines; a practice particular to the Gelukpa or Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism. The college was built over an area of 1,600 square metres (17,000 sq ft) with 30 dewelling units. However, in 1761 lightning struck the main hall which was rebuilt in 1761. The hall, as finally refurbished, had 70 pillars (8 tall and 62 short pillars) which housed a galaxy of statues of Buddhist gurus with the main deity of Shakyamuni Buddha made in copper. The other Bodhisattvas enshrined along with the main deity were of Maitreya, Manjushri, Amatyas, Bhavishyaguru, Tsongkhapa (with his students), Dalai Lama VII, Pawanga Rinpoche and several other past teachers of the college.The college had five chapels with plethora of statues and frescoes, which from west to east were: Tawok Lhkhang with images of Tawok, protection deity of the east, the Je Rinpoche Lhakhang with images of Tsongkhapa and Shakyamuni, the Neten Lhakhang\nwith images of Buddha of Three Times in the company of 'Sixteen Elders' depicted in their mountain caves, volumes of the sacred Prajnaparamita text; the Jowokhang with large Buddha image (replaced an earlier image of Miwang Jowo Shakyamuni) along with Eight Bodhisattvas, and gatekeepers Hayagriva and Acala; and the Tsongkhapa Lhakhang, the last chapel on the right, with several images \u2013 Je Rinpoche, Atisha, Dromtonpa, Dalai Lamas I-III, Dalai Lama V, Jamchen Shakya Yeshe, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first teacher of Sera), Kunkhen Jangchub Penpa (founder of Sera Me) and many more.The second floor of the college had the Nyima Lhakhang where image of Shakhyamuni Buddha was deified along with Tuwang Tsultrim, and the Khangyur Lhakhang with 1000 images of Tara which replaced the sacred texts that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. The third floor was reserved for the Dalai Lamas.\n\n\n=== Sera Je College ===\nSera Je Tretsang (College) or Zhekong, the largest college in Sera complex, measured an area of 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft). It was initially a three storied building; a fourth floor was added in the 18th century by strengthening the building with a total of 100 columns. It had a statue of the Hayagriva (said to have been sculpted by Lodro Rinchen himself in gilded copper), also known popularly as Avalokite\u015bvara, which was considered the protective deity of the monastery. This wrathful deity was worshipped as dispeller of obstacles with healing powers. Tokden Yonten Gonpo, worshipped this deity first and on divine injunction initiated his son Kunkhepa, to follow this tradition. Kunkhepa, with the blessings of Lama Tsongkhapa, institutionalised the name of Hayagriva or Tamdin Yangsang as the supreme protector deity of the monastery. The assembly hall of the college depicted frescoes of Buddha's life achievements, the thrones of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas; seen on its north wall were stupas (reliquaries) and images of Dalai Lama VIII and Dalai Lama XIII, Reting Telkus II and IX, and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera).\n\nThe Chapels which were circumambulated sequentially are: the Dusum Sangye Lhakhang which housed statues of \u201cBuddhas of Three Times\u201d and Eight Bodhistavas; the Tamdrin Lhakhang housed the main image of Hayagriva; the Jhampa Lhakhang contained images of Maitreya, Eleven-faced Mahakarunika, and Tsongkhapa with his disciples amidst a coveted library; the Tsongkhapa Lhakhang with images of Tsongkhapa with his best students, main Lamas of Sera Je, Nagarjuna and other Buddhist commentators of India, gate keepers Havagriva and Acala; the Jampeyang Lhakhang to the north-east had two images of Manjushri, one in a Dharmacakramudra (teaching pose) looking towards the Debating Courtyard.The second floor of the monastery on the west called the Zelre Lhakhang provided an overview of the main Hayagriva image in the floor below, and also a small image of Nine-headed Hayagriva along with images of Padmasambhava, the 5th Dalai Lama and the protector deities. One floor above this was the Namgyel Lhakhang and the last floor above this was the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and teachers of Sera Je.\n\n\n=== Ngakpa Tratsang ===\n\nThe Ngakpa Tratsang, also spelled Ngaba Zhacang, was the smallest of the three colleges that was set up in the complex. It was a three storied building originally built in 1419 by Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge. It was refurbished in the 18th century by Lhazang Khan. Devoted to tantric studies, the college had an assembly hall and two chapels in the ground floor. The Assembly hall was built with four tall and 42 short columns with elegantly carved capitals. The main image in the centre of the hall was of Jamchen Chojey (wearing a black hat), founder of the monastery. It was believed that the Yongle Emperor (1360\u20131424) presented this image to Sera. Other images enshrined in the hall were of Maitreya, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first religious teacher of Sera), Pawangka Rinpoche, Tsongkhapa (with his principle disciples), Dalai Lama XIII, Chokyi Gyeltsen and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera Je). The two chapels housed many statues; in the Neten Lhakhang chapel of Shakyamuni Buddha along with images of 16 elders in double series (Upper series made in Tibetan style and the lower series in Chinese lacquer given by the Chinese Emperor); and the Jigje Lakhang chapel housed the 15th century image of Bhairava along with those of Mahakala, Dharmaraja, Shridevi and many others. While the third story was the residence of the Dalai Lama, the second floor had the images Amitayus and also eight 'Medicine Buddhas', as also reliquaries (stupas) of Gyeltsen Zangpo and Jetsun Chokyi Gyeltsen. However, as per reports, this college was destroyed and all resident monks also died in the bombardment done by the Chinese in 1959.\n\n\n=== Homdong Khangtsang ===\nHomdong Khangtsang, also spelt \u2018Kamcuns\u2019 in Tibetan language, are the main dwelling units or dormitories which house the monks of the monastery; there are thirty-three Kamcuns surrounding the central courtyard. The size of the Kamcuns varied, depending on the strength of monks housed. Monks of the same village are housed together; however each monk is given a separate cell. Each Kamcun also has a prayer hall for exclusive study of Buddhist doctrine and also has annexed tea house. However, the main assembly hall here had minor images of Tsongkhapa, Choyi Gyeltsen, Shakhyamuni Buddha, Three Deities of Longevity, and two inner chapels \u2013 the Jampakhang with \u2018speaking\u2019 image of Tara (protector of the springs in Sera) and Lama Tubten Kunga (who renovated Sera Me) and Gonkhang chapel with the image of the protector deity Gyelchen Karma Trinle.\n\n\n==== Choding Khang ====\n\nChoding Khang is the hermitage located just behind the Great Assembly Hall (on the hill slope of Sera Utse). This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated. The hermitage is accessed through a track where painted rock carvings of Tsongkhapa, Jamchen and Dharma Raja (the protector) are seen flanking the stepped approaches, along the route. A new building has been constructed in place of the old hermitage, which was destroyed during the Revolution. Below the hermitage are the Upper Tantric College (Gyuto) and Lower Tantric College (Gyu-me) of Lhasa). A further climb up the hill leads to caves where Tsongkhapa meditated.\n\n\n== Hermitages and nunneries ==\nSera Monastery that developed over the centuries into a renowned place of learning, which trained hundreds of scholars who attained name and fame in the Buddhist nations, has under its affiliation 19 hermitages, including four nunneries, which are all located in the foot hills above Lhasa. The nunneries established are the Chupzang Nunnery, the Garu Nunnery, the Negodong Nunnery and the Nenang Nunnery and a few nuns of some of these nunneries held protest marches against the Chinese rule, and as a result suffered incarnation and indignities. Brief details of the hermitages and nunneries are:\n\n\n=== Hermitages ===\n\n\n==== Pabongkha Hermitage ====\n\nPabonka Hermitage (pha bong kha ri khrod), the largest and most important of the Sera hermitages is located about 8 km (5.0 mi) northwest of Lhasa in the Nyang bran Valley on the slopes of Mount Parasol.\nThe site, which is over 1,300 years old, dates back to Songts\u00e4n Gampo, the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and was amongst the first buildings built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement. Although originally the site of his castle or fort, the Tibetan Annals have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery, possibly under the reign of the second great Buddhist king of Tibet Trisong Detsen. Detsen, along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new Tibetan Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet's very earliest Buddhist monasteries, possibly even pre-dating Jokhang.\nThe original nine-storied monastery was partially destroyed by King Langdharma in 841 AD during his campaign to destroy monastic Buddhism; it was rebuilt in the 11th century as a two-storied structure that housed 200 monks.\n\nJe Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419) lived at the site as a hermit, and it eventually became a scholarly institution. The Fifth Dalai Lama was known to be fond of the monastery and funded the building of an upper floor for Pabonka.Before 1959, Pabonka was independent of Sera Monastery, and from 1960 to the mid-1980s it was controlled by the Chinese. It then came under the control of Sera, whose monks renovated it and are continuing its traditions.\nThis temple is noted for its many shrines, and its blue and carved gold mantra in the hallway, inscribed with words meaning, \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\". A number of stone relics were buried during the Cultural Revolution but when Sera monks restored the hermitage they excavated the relics and restored most of them. A central shrine, dating back 1300 years to Gampo, is located in the temple and depicts Chenresig, Jampelyang and Chana Dorje, the so-called \"Rigsum Gompo Trinity\" from which the temple takes its name. Up the hill from the hermitage, past a group of chortens, is Palden Lhamo Cave, a cave known to have been a meditation chamber of Songstan Gampo himself and contains statues of himself, his two wives and a rock carving of Palden Lhamo, the protectress.The hermitage notably has its own tradition of monthly and yearly ritual cycles. The most important of these yearly ritual events (at least for the laity) are the six-day (three sets of two-day) Avalokite\u015bvara fasting rituals that take place during the Tibetan New Year (Losar) celebrations, the sixteen-day (eight sets of two-day) Avalokite\u015bvara fasting rituals that take place during the fourth Tibetan month (they attract many people from Lhasa and the surrounding districts), and a ritual and other events that take place during the \u201cSixth-Month Fourth-Day\u201d pilgrimage.\n\n\n==== Drakri Hermitage ====\nDrakri Hermitage (brag ri ri khrod), also known as Bari Hermitage (sba ri ri khrod) lies about three kilometres north and slightly east of central Lhasa. Drakri, believed to have been founded by the abbot of Pha bong kh in the 18th century, was used as a meditational retreat by Klong rdol bla ma ngag dbang blo bzang (1719\u20131794), one of the most renowned scholars of the Lhopa Regional House (Lho pa khang tshan) of the J\u00e9 College (Grwa tshang byes). Drakri Hermitage had control over Garu Nunnery since its early history and supervised the training of the Garu nuns until 1959. In 1959, the monks of the hermitage were evicted and the hermitage was turned into the notorious Drapchi Prison, which gained a reputation for being one of the most severe penal institutions run by the Chinese in Tibet.In the 1980s a citizen of Lhasa re-established the monastery under the Nyingma sect to remember his late mother. After receiving permission from the Lhasa municipal government, he began renovating the site, although a former official of the Bari Lama's estate who had previously controlled the monastery initially objected to it being converted into Nyingma practice centre. Today the hermitage, still partly ruined, consists of five major sections; a main temple compound around a central courtyard with a temple, kitchen, and some of the monks\u2019 living quarters, an extensive ruined terraced complex just south of the main temple which before 1959 served as the meeting rooms and the living quarters of the workers and business managers of the Drakri Lama's estate, a building that had served as the living quarters for the eight fully ordained monks who formed the ritual core of the monastic community, a stable for mdzo, a yak-cow hybrid and several huts. The main temple contains statues of Guru Rinpoche and several tantric deities and a three-dimensional model of Guru Rinpoche's celestial palace, the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain (Zangs mdog dpal ri). Today there are four tantric priests residing in the main temple compound and two nuns living in huts to the southeast.\n\n\n==== Jokpo Hermitage ====\nThe ruins of Jokpo Hermitage (\u2019jog po ri khrod) is located in the far western end of the Nyang bran Valley. The former property of the Jokpo Lama\u2019s estate before the Chinese invasion in 1959, it originally served as the meditation retreat of a monk named \u2019Jog po rin po che of the Sera M\u00e9 College. The monk was a great meditator and according to tradition, after he died, his body remained in a state of perpetual meditative equipoise and was kept inside the Zhungpa Regional House temple where the monks reported that his hair and nails continued to grow even after his death. Before the Chinese invasion his body was buried and decayed and when the regional house (khang tshan) was rebuilt in the 1980s, his bones were exhumed. These are today placed inside the altar's clay statue in the regional house temple.\n\n\n==== Keutsang Hermitage ====\n\nKeutsang Hermitage (Ke\u2019u tshang ri khrod) was a precariously perched cave hermitage inhabited by the great Tibetan guru Tsongkhapa. However, the original cave collapsed in a landslide. What is present now was rebuilt, adjoining the ruined Keutsang West Hermitage, at a safer location. As it exists now, Keutsang is located to the east of Sera on a hill side above Lhasa\u2019s principal cemetery. Rakhadrak Hermitage is located below this hermitage, within a close distance. This hermitage is also part of the Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit (se ra\u2019i ri \u2019khor) that pilgrims undertake during the \u2018Sixth-Month Fourth-Day (drug pa tshe bzhi)\u2019  celebrations. The hermitage had smooth relationship with Sera all through its history so much so that every official monk of the hermitage enjoyed de facto status of a monk of the Hamdong Regional House (Har gdong khang tshan) of the J\u00e9 College also. The monastery also observes all ritualistic practices.Some special aspects of the temple complex are: the belief that Maitreya (Byams pa) assures rebirth to those whose remains are brought to the cemetery below Keu tshang and it is also believed that light rays are exchanged between the Maitreya image here and the Maitreya Chapel at the northern end of the Barskor in Lhasa.During the 1959 Cultural Revolution, the present and the fifth Keutsang incarnation (Keutshang sku phreng lnga pa) was incarcerated for a time and later he sought asylum in India in the 1980s.The hermitage was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Rebuilding it was started by a former monk of the hermitage in 1991 and was completed by 1992. The rebuilt hermitage now houses 25 monks.\n\n\n==== Keutsang East Hermitage ====\n\nKeutsang East Hermitage (ke\u2019u tshang shar ri khrod), a small hermitage exists now only in ruins between Keutsang West (Ke\u2019u tshang nub), (now part of Kuetsang Hermitage) and the Purchok Hermitage. Its location is to the north of Lhasa. Prior to 1959, the hermitage belonged to Purchok Hermitage. It consisted of an assembly hall and monks\u2019 quarters and was famous for the divine image of Avalokite\u015bvara who blessed the dead at the funeral ground here. There were ten resident monks. However, at present there no plans to rebuild the hermitage due to lack of funds.\n\n\n==== Keutsang West Hermitage ====\nKeutsang West Hermitage is also in ruins and at present the Keutsang Hermitage has been built next to these ruins.\n\n\n==== Khardo Hermitage ====\nKhardo Hermitage (Mkhar rdo ri khrod) is a historical hermitage in the Dod\u00e9 Valley, to the northeast of Lhasa and Sera monastery, which is named after the local deity (gnas bdag), known as Mkhar rdo srong btsan. Its setting is in a charnel ground ideal to perform tantric rites. The hermitage known as the \"abode of saints\" is surrounded by mountains on three sides which are all assigned divine names such as the \u2018Soul Mountain of the Buddhas of the Five Families (Rgyal ba\u2019i rigs lnga bla ri)' for a group of hills behind the monastery, 'Soul Mountain of Cakrasamvara (Bde mchog bla ri) where hand implements and bone ornaments of the deity were found, and the \u2018Birth Deity Peak (Khrungs ba\u2019i lha ri or \u2019Khrungs\u2019 fro)'  for the hill to the left of the hermitage. A cave here is known by the name the 'Offering Place Cave (Brag mchod sa)', (a copy of the holy Scriptures (Bka\u2019gyur) is said to have been found here). Several local legends are narrated in respect of the history of founding the hermitage by Bzod pa rgya mtsho who lived in a cave here under the direction of the local deity. It was established in 1706.\nThe hermitage, now in ruins, was originally built in three tiers (one above the other): the lowest tier was the hermitage or the main compound, the middle tier was known as the Upper Residence (Gzims khang gong ma) and top tier was the Temple of the Sixteen Arhats (Gnas bcu lha khang). The Seventh Dalai Lama, who was a student, fully supported Bzod pa rgya mtsho to build the first temple (Temple of the Sixteen Arhats) and also a residence for himself to stay during his visits to the hermitage, which came to be known as the 'Upper Residence'. The Dalai Lama's reverence for his guru was so deep that when the Bzod pa rgya mtsho died, he even performed the last rites for him, got installed his funerary st\u016bpa and statue. He also located the Incarnate Lama of his guru at 'Phan po' near Lhasa. The second Bzod pa rgya mtsho also had excellent equation with the Eighth Dalai Lama, Jampel Gyatso (Da lai bla ma sku phreng brgyad pa \u2019jam dpal rgya mtsho). This power equation resulted in two more monasteries being built as satellite monasteries.\n\n\n==== Panglung Hermitage ====\nPanglung Hermitage (spangs lung ri khrod) is located in the valley, northeast and downhill from Phur lcog. Panglung lies completely in ruins although it once had a large temple and a Rdo rje shugs ldan oracle; an individual who would go into trance to make prognostications while possessed by the god. Panglung was attempted to be renovated in the 1990s, but met opposition from the local people because the site had always been associated with this controversial protector deity, so redevelopment was prevented.\n\n\n==== Purbuchok Hermitage ====\n\nPurbuchok Hermitage (Phur bu lcog ri khrod) is situated in the Lhasa suburb of Dog bde in the northern mountains at the north-east corner of the Lhasa Valley. It is the last hermitage to be visited on the \u201cSixth-Month Fourth-Day\u201d (drug pa tshe bzhi) pilgrimage circuit. Fairly fully rehabilitated, it is considered an attractive hermitage. The hills surrounding the monastery have been given name tags of the three protectors of the divine paradise namely the Avalokite\u015bvara, Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b and Vajrap\u0101ni. It is also identified with the six syllables divine mantra (sngags)- \"OM Mani Padme Hum\".History of the hermitage is traced to the 9th century when Padmasambhava (Padma \u2019byung gnas) meditated here. The main cave where he did penance is known as the \u2018Cavern of Dochung Chongzhi (Rdo cung cong zhi\u2019i phug pa)\u2019. Over the centuries, the monastery has seen many leading lights of the Tibetan monastic order playing a role in its building, such as the Zhang \u2019gro ba\u2019i mgon po g.yu brag pa (1123\u20131193), female saint Ma cig lab sgron, Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho's (1641\u20131713), Ngawang Jampa (Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa, 1682\u20131762) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes (1663\u20131737). Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi (Rgyal mo tshe ring bkra shis) and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas (1689\u20131747) also supported the activities of the hermitage. However, the most significant face of development occurred during the third Purchok incarnation Lozang Ts\u00fcltrim Jampa Gyatso (Phur lcog sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang tshul khrims byams pa rgya mtsho) who was teacher of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas.However, the Cultural Revolution of 1959 saw almost total destruction of the hermitage. Since 1984, with approval of the local government, a reconstruction face was begun and the hermitage has been substantially restored now to its past glory.\n\n\n==== Rakhadrak Hermitage ====\n\nRakhadrak Hermitage (Ra kha brag ri khrod) is a historical hermitage, belonging to the Sera Monastery. It is located to the northeast of Sera and to the north of Lhasa. Mother of the Fifth Dalai Lama (Da lai bla ma sku phreng lnga pa) was the hermitage's benefactor. Under her patronage, the upper temple complex was built as a formal monastery. The hermitage was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution of 1959. In the 1980s, Sera took control of the hermitage complex. However, rebuilding activity has been sporadic and monastic rituals are not held.\n\n\n==== Sera Ch\u00f6ding Hermitage ====\nSera Ch\u00f6ding Hermitage (Se ra chos sdings ri khrod) was a tantric college (rgyud smad grwa tshang) before the 1959 Cultural Revolution. Located close to Sera and facing south, it has a yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa. The interesting story of this house is that a local 'site-spirit' (gzhi bdag) used to visit Tsongkhapa through a narrow window in the house. Tsong kha pa's mural image is seen here on the wall, which is credited with special powers as an \u201cimage that speaks\u201d or known as speaking-statue (gsung byon ma). It was Tsongkhapa's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his magnum opus, the \u201cGreat Commentary on the Praj\u00f1\u0101m\u016bla (Rtsa shes D\u012bk chen). He also taught here. It is also known as the hermitage where Tsongkhapa assigned his Tantric teachings to Rje shes rab seng ge (1383\u20131445), the founder of the Tantric Colleges.\n\n\n==== Sera G\u00f6npasar Hermitage ====\nSera G\u00f6npasar Hermitage (se ra dgon pa gsar ri khrod) is derived from the Tibetan name dgon pa gsar, meaning \u201cnew monastery.\u201d Today it lies completely in ruins but the hermitage belonged to the bla mas of the Dgon pa gsar\nincarnation lineage and was established as a Dge lugs hermitage by the first G\u00f6npasar incarnation, Ngawang D\u00f6ndrup. The hermitage was run by thirteen fully ordained monks before its destruction in 1959. Some foundations and fragments of walls remain, including some notable rock carvings and a large stupa.\n\n\n==== Sera Uts\u00e9 Hermitage ====\n\nSera Uts\u00e9 Hermitage (se ra dbu rtse ri khrod), meaning \u201cSera Peak\u201d is located on the mountain directly behind Sera Monastery itself, which is about 5 km (3.1 mi) north of the Jokhang, about a 1\u00bd-hour walk up the hill from the main complex of Sera. It is reputedly older than Sera Gompa. According to tradition, the site contained one of Tsongkhapa\u2019s (1357\u20131419) meditation huts and Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho (1641\u20131713) was reputed to have meditated here at end of the seventeenth or early eighteenth century. He was a distinguished meditator, who brought his knowledge of the philosophical tradition to Sera Uts\u00e9 and attracted many students, amongst them included Phur lcog ngag dbang byams pa (1682\u20131762), and Mkhar rdo bzod pa rgya mtsho (1672\u20131749).\nHistorically the monastery was of substantial size but following its destruction by the Chinese in 1959 it was drastically reduced and only a section rebuilt. Sera Uts\u00e9 has a two-storied chapel and monks' quarters with magnificent views over the city of Lhasa. There is a protector shrine to Pehar and Shridevi. A small assembly hall remains, which was once believed to contain a large metal statue of Vajrabhairava (Rdo rje \u2019jigs byed), a great statue of Yam\u0101ntaka Ekav\u012bra, statues of the Buddha and the Sixteen Arhats, a speaking T\u0101r\u0101 (Sgrol ma) statue, large images of Tsongkhapa and his two disciples, and statues of the bla mas of the Drupkhang incarnation (Sgrub khang sprul sku) lineage. Today the hall is inhabited by three monks but is not in use for central worship.The bla ma\u2019s residence which was inhabited by Sgrub khang bla also still exists and consists of two rooms with a central waiting room between them. There is also Sgrub khang pa's meditation hut, a small protector deity chapel, a Dharma enclosure (chos rwa), a ruined kitchen and various smaller huts, which are used mostly for storage today.\n\n\n==== Takten Hermitage ====\nTakten Hermitage (Rtags bstan ri khrod) is situated to the east of Trashi Ch\u00f6ling Hermitage and to the north-east of Sera. According to a legend, Dge lugs pa bla ma, Pha bong kha bde chen snying po (1878\u20131941) on a visit to this area to find a site for locating his hermitage saw a crow which spoke to him. He interpreted it as a \u201crevealed sign\u201d to build his hermitage here. The hermitage mostly consists of caves with fascia at the entrance to the caves. It belongs to the Pabongkha Lama's estate (Pha bong kha bla brang). Yes i agree However, Dge lugs pa nuns, who have carried out restoration works at the hermitage now live here.\n\n\n==== Trashi Ch\u00f6ling Hermitage ====\nTrashi Ch\u00f6ling Hermitage (Bkra shis chos gling ri khrod), which means \u201cThe Place of Auspicious Dharma\u201d is located 3 km (1.9 mi)  from Sera on the hills to the north-west of Sera. The hermitage, which is south facing, is part of the pilgrimage of the \"Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit (se ra ri \u2019khor)\". The hermitage that was substantially destroyed during the Cultural Revolution was rebuilt during the 1990s. The hermitage is now a part of the Pabongkha Lama's estate, the present incarnation, (after his recent return to Tibet) and is stated to be functioning as an autonomous institution with minimum allegiance to Sera.\n\n\n=== Nunneries ===\n\n\n==== Chupzang Nunnery ====\n\nThe hermitage is believed to have been founded by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. He was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a \u201csite investigation\u201d (sa brtag) to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery. The Dalai Lama made the treasure (gter) discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang's lower temple. However, the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to Phrin las rgya mtsho's nephew, Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in around 1696.The hermitage belonged to Chubzang ye shes rgya mtsho for sometime who built a four-pillar temple with rear chapel and porticos at the site. It was later under the possession of Byang chub chos \u2019phel (1756\u20131838) and Khri byang sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang yeshes, who was a junior tutor to the living 14th Dalai Lama.In 1921, Pha bong kha bde chen snying po (1878\u20131941) stayed at Chubzang and published his teachings through his most famous work, Liberation in Our Hands (Rnam grol lagbcangs).In the 1950s, the site began to be used as a religious retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.\n\n\n==== Gari Nunnery ====\nGari Nunnery is located north of Lhasa. The nunnery has an ancient history traced to the 11th century when Pha dam pa sangs rgyas), the Buddhist preceptor, visited this location. He not only named the place as \"Garu\" but also ordained that it shall be a \"Nunnery\" not a monastery of monks, on the basis of prophetic events that occurred during his visit to the place. The Nunnery's fame in recent years is the leading and bold role that some of the nuns have played in organizing silent demonstrations against the Chinese rule, and seeking freedom of Tibet. Many of the protesting nuns were arrested, incarcerated, brutally handled and released only after protracted detention.\n\n\n==== Negodong Nunnery ====\nNegodong Nunnery, a historical hermitage, is located in the Lhasa suburb of Dog bde, northeast of Sera (and also of Lhasa). It is believed that it was originally a retreat of the Buddhist scholar of the Sera J\u00e9 College's (Grwa tshang byes) Gomd\u00e9 Regional House (Sgom sde khang tshan), Nam mkha\u2019 rgyal mtshan. It was initially founded as a monastery with seventeen monks but later allotted in 1930 for exclusive use as a nunnery to provide personal security to the nuns who were then residing in a remote nunnery at Gnas nang (in a remote higher valley to the east) away from the present location at Nedong Nunnery  Gnas sgo gdong (about a one-hour walk). The monks were shifted to Gnas nang(the original home of the nuns).\n\n\n==== Nenang Nunnery ====\nNenang Nunnery (Gnas nang dgon pa) is located to the east of Negodong Nunnery (Gnas sgo gdong dgon pa) in Lhasa prefecture. It is associated with Padmasambhava who is stated to have meditated in two nearby caves in the 9th century. Founding the hermitage as a nunnery is credited to a nun (interpreted as a Dakini) by name Jets\u00fcn (or Khach\u00f6) Dr\u00f6ldor Wangmo (Rje btsun nam mkha\u2019 spyod sgrol rdor dbang mo). It functioned well as nunnery during her time and also during the next generation but went into decline thereafter. It was then brought under the jurisdiction of the Khardo Hermitage.\n\n\n== Debates ==\n\nDebates among monks on the Buddhist doctrines are integral to the learning process in the colleges in the Sera Monastery complex. This facilitates better comprehension of the Buddhist philosophy to attain higher levels of study. This exemplary debating tradition supplemented with gestures is said to be exclusive to this monastery, among the several other monasteries of Lhasa. Visitors also attend to witness these debates that are held as per a set schedule, every day in the 'Debating Courtyard' of the monastery.\n\n\n=== Procedures and rules ===\n\nThe debate among monks unfolds in the presence of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient \u2018Hindu Orthodoxy\u2019 in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery's precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: \u201cI accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)\u201d. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to \u201cconflicting opinions of participants and listeners.\u201d When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.\n\n\n=== Physical gestures ===\n\nDebates are punctuated with vigorous gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed in a formal monk's attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender's arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing the back of his right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.\n\n\n=== Schedule ===\nThe tradition of conducting debates in the Gelukpa tradition was set in many monasteries of the Gelukpa sect, namely the Ganden Monastery, the Sera Monastery, the Drepung Monastery and the JIC, not only in pre-modern Tibet but also in other similar monasteries established in exile, such as in Sera, India. At each location in Tibet, the debates are held under eight debating schedules in a year, depending on the rituals and festivals observed during the whole year. Each daily session is held between eight breaks when students debate on issues of Buddhist scriptures and related subjects. In the Sera monastery, the debate alternated by rituals has a daily schedule (with alterations to suit the climatic season) of the Morning debate (07:00 to 10:00), Noon debate (11:00 to 13:00), Afternoon debate (14:00 to 16:00) and Night debate (08:30 to 09:30).\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe monastery hosts an impressive festival, popularly known as the \u2018Sera Bengqin Festival\u2019, which is largely attended by monks and devotees. The festival is held some time in February as per the Gregorian calendar corresponding to specific date fixed by the monastery according to the Tibetan calendar. On the festival day, a Dorje Pestle is ceremoniously taken to the Potala Palace. The Dalai Lama offers prayers to the Buddha to bestow strength and blesses the Pestle. Thereafter, the pestle is briefly placed on the heads of the monks and disciples by the Khenpo (president) of the Ngaba Zhacang.Another popular festival witnessed by visitors and locals is the Sho Dun Festival held in the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. The festival represents the symbolic Buddha-Unfolding, where worship of the Buddha is the essential part.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nGraduates of Sera Jey and Mey College who are known in the West include:\n\nGeshe Ngawang Tsondu, Wisdom of The Staten Island, Dharma Centre, The Meditation Factory, and Tibet House, New York City.\nGeshe Lhundub Sopa, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\nGeshe Rabten, an eminent monk who directed Tharpa Chloing Buddhist Center in Mont Pelerin, Switzerland.\nKyabje Choden Rinpoche, Sera Jey's debate representative for the occasion of the 14th Dalai Lama's Geshe examinations; renowned scholar and yogi who spent 19 years in solitary dark retreat. \nLama Thubten Yeshe, founder of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT).\nLama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, a student of Lama Yeshe and presently director of FPMT.\nPabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo \u2014 Author of Liberation in the Palm of Your Hands - a highly revered Lama who lived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and was the Spiritual Guide of Trijang Rinpoche, the 14th Dalai Lama's own Spiritual Guide.\nSermey Khensur Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin\u2014former abbot of Sera Mey university in Bylakuppe.\nGeshe Tenzin Zopa, attendant of Geshe Lama Konchog, and the subject of the 2008 documentary film Unmistaken Child.\nKyabje Khensur Kangurwa Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche, 69th Abbot, Founder of the Tibetan Sponsorship Scheme and Tibetan Buddhist Institute\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBooz, Elizabeth B.

          "Very live and vibrant, lots to see, try to attend part of the chanting service ans watch the monks in groups.",

          "Very beautiful Monastery with a very warm feeling to it. Beautiful grounds too. We visited in October & was not too crowded. Very picturesque.",
          "While the Sera monastery is not one of the more attractive monasteries, a visit on a day when a so-called debate is taking place in well worth the trip. I wouldn't call the activity a debate, as such; it looked more like a quizzing by \"master\" monks of \"novice\" monks, with much",
          "Interesting monastery to see. Large area and pleasant walk if the weather is good. At certain time (for us was around 15:00) all the Buddhism students are getting together for a debating class in a countryyard.",
          "This visit was ok but not spectacular. The debating monks were nice to watch and the big assembly hall is beautiful",
          "Used to produce thousands of monks for this world, not anymore. A must visit monastery in Lhasa city to understand the history.",
          "Sera Monastery has an Assembly Hall, 3 colleges and 33 houses. It is the second largest monastery in Tibet. Another no photo place inside this monastery however it is nowhere near as spectacular as the others we have visited so that was OK. However Sera Monastery was one of",
          "A Nice monastery in Lhasa. Not too far from the city. Architecture was nice and a lot of history to take in. When we went, there were not too many tourists.. which was great for us. One of the main attractions at the monastery is where you can watch monks debate among",
          "The trouble with Lhasa is you get monastery fatigue, but this is a lovely monastery, just north of the city. However, it's famed for its 3pm debating sessions and I was stupid enoguh to go on a Sunday which is the one day of the week they don't do it.",
          "This gives you a good bit of flavor for the Bhudist lifestyle of the monks. There are many examples of how they live and worship. Definitely with going. See the debate at 3:00 pm. The artistry is mostly done by the monks.",
          "The Sera monastery is not as impressive as other monasteries In Lhasa, but seeing the monks debate in the court yard is worth the trip. There is a lot of hand gesturing and clapping.",
          "The monestry situated in Tibet, is something one must visit. The great debate , is an occasion, where the two steams of thoughts in the monestry debate each other to conclude on certain isuues. Though the medium if debate isin their language, we being mere spectators. It is a",
          "Sera isn't always on the Lhasa itinerary but don't let that sway you. It is a beautiful monastery and is not particulary touristed. I enjoyed the quietness with most of the populace being worshipping local Tibetans. Don't miss the walk inside the main stupa or the walk to the",
          "Tibet is full of surprises. Sera monastery is one these. Our walk up the monastery was pretty mundane. Some food stalls and vendors selling sunglasses etc. even entering the monastery was pretty ordinary but as we got to the top we encountered around 20-30 monks in what appeared",
          "Amazing experience, beautiful view with lots of history & knowledge. Rich in culture and tradition..",
          "Wonderful place watching the monks debate. I bought some beautiful book covers from the library for a great price.",
          "Just like we found in all the other monasteries and temples, they are a part of ancient Tibet , remain beautiful, but monks are missing to make them alive",
          "Great experience to visit the Sera Monastery tucked into a backdrop of rugged mountains. Saw the Buddhist monk debates and the architecture was quite amazing. It was peaceful to walk the cobblestones within the monastery and take it all in.",
          "A vist to Lhasa without spending several hours at Sara monastery is inconceivable. Watching the dialog among the Sera monastery monks gave us a better understanding of what elightment means.",
          "After seeing a few monasteries, we thought \"oh no, another one\"!\u0e3a\u0e35 But this was interesting because of the debating courtyard where monks are enthusiastically arguing/debating. Could have sat and watched/listened for ages. Worth going just to see this!",
          "We visited to see the monks debating, which was very interesting. Also to see how they make the tablets they use for prayer.",
          "The two unique things we have seen in Sera monastery was 3 sand mandalas. This is really special because due to Tibetan customs, the monks will usually destroy the mandala after a certain time, but those mandalas are conserved for tourists. For 10yuan, you are allowed to take",
          "For me the main highlight of this monastery was watching the monks debating. Other than that, after visiting many monasteries in Tibet, this one did not amaze me. The printing room is good to see. The monks usually do the debate between 15:00 to 16:00 and it's great to watch.",
          "There are a number of attractions here, but the highlight is the debating. You will need a guide who will explain what is happening then sit and watch. No cameras, but able to use your phone!",
          "Here you can visit the printing house and amongst other things you can presence the monks debating. It is quite interesting however I just can\u2019t tell if it serious or they just put a show for you. Out of all the places we visited this is the one that impressed me the least.",
          "We didn\u2019t spend much time exploring, but found the monk debates fascinating. Though, of course, we had no idea what they were saying to each other, it was easy to spot the more senior monks and those just learning how to do it.",
          "We did not do this Monastery justice. It was the third monastery we had visited that day and the various unique aspects of each monastery were beginning to meld into each other. This monastery had lots of children lining up for a special blessing on the day we were there.",
          "Like all tourists, we went to Sera Monastery to see the debating monks. We expected to stay ten minutes but watched and listened for about 45 minutes. Our guide said, \u201cTake your time,\u201d and we did! We found it fascinating to observe the hand and body gestures of the questioning",
          "This is a beautiful monastery and temple, but the kick is to be there for the debate time in the courtyard from 3-5 in the afternoon. It is more like haranguing as foot stomping and slapping are a big part of cutting ignorance and stamping out evil.",
          "This is a very interesting monastery; and even though they are trying to renovate portions, it is well worth coming to see this beautiful place nestled in the crook of the mountains and experience the peacefulness.",
          "Do not miss a visit to this place. First you have to go up the mountain on a meandering road. At the end of the road you encounter the monastery. Even though it is now a pale image of its past splendour it does strike you with its implantation in the mountain. Take your time to",
          "I had such an unique experience in Sera Monastery. This monastery is one of the best in Tibet and worth visiting. The most interesting thing there is the debate that Monks had which was itself very exciting and fun to see.",
          "I especially enjoyed seeing the mandelas and the monks debating Buddhist scriptures. Sera has a great history. Travelers should study prior to the visit. Our guide was excellent.",
          "An extraordinary experience to see the monks debate and too visit the grounds. You can tour the buildings and gardens. The debates between the monks is animated and fun even if you have no understanding of the language...here is body language in action!",
          "We got to see the monks debating which is very interesting and fun to witness. This is an iconic monastery to visit with everything you would expect to see. Best to get there early to avoid the crowds.",

          "Our group visited this place on our first day in Lhasa. Lots to explore in the monastery. The monks sell yak products as well as souvenirs. The highlight is to watch the monks \u201cdebate\u201d each other. To me it looked more like an question and answer session. The monk sitting on",
          "Perhaps it was the wrong time of the day to visit - we had to wait for 1 1/2 hours to enter due to a performance show which was a must to see. Buildings are the same of you visit temples and pagodas for 2 weeks...",
          "A very nice, open monastery complex, well maintained in traditional style. Intresting to see monks wandering around in traditional garments using modern iphones! The temples are similar to others but nonetheless very interesting to see and experience. Most of the buildings are",
          "This place may not be on some of the Tibet tour's agenda, but I think it is a hidden jew in Lhasa. You will learn/see something very interesting and most importantly it is something you can related to... By related to I mean piece of history that is not too long ago, just 50-60",
          "Besides the extraordinary indoor architecture of the Sera Monastery, you must attend the daily debate of the 80 monks in the enclosed courtyard, you sit around the courtyard. Make sure your guide explains the century-old protocol of the discussion so that you understand what",
          "The monk debate was the most interesting part of this visit. Our guide explained the process, and we watched for about 20 minutes.",
          "A huge, very important monastery on the outskirts of Lhasa. Allow pleanty of time for this fabulous structure. Try to get there in the afternoon - strating a 3 pm is the debating round in the courtyard. Absolutely fascinating!",
          "Lots of construction. A bit dusty. A few areas were closed when we were there. The debating monks tends to be the highlight, but it seemed to me to be more for show. It feels a bit more like a \"tourist attraction\" than an actual functioning monastery.",
          "This was a nice stop on our tour. Beautiful area, well maintained. We enjoyed the easy pace of the tour in preparation for our next day climb at Potala Palace steps.",
          "Nice monastery and easy to access and not very big. The highlight is the monks debating. I would suggest getting inside the debating area early to get a good view.",
          "Lots of interesting exhibits but mostly no photographs inside. Nice wooden block display and the temple has some very nice Buddhas. The monks debating in the afternoon is quite unique and a must see.",
          "The big draw is the debates between monks. More of a one on one teaching method. This is entertaining even if you dont know the language. This is an easy monastery to go to few steps and a mild walk",
          "Sera monastery is easy to get to in the city. It is an easy walk up a gentle slope through the monastery. The architecture is interesting especially the new construction using modern technology. The Mandela\u2019s. Are beautiful in a verfunny place-a storage room. TThe assembly",
          "Highly recommend going to the debating section at the top of the hill, incredible to spectate. The monastery is under a lot of construction at the moment but this by no means detracts from the wonders that lie within.",
          "I\u2019d read this was a good place to visit but wasn\u2019t too enthused about the approach to the monastery it didn\u2019t seem very appealing, this is not a terrifically scenic place but we arrived in time to see the Monks debating. Monks work in groups of 2-3 with one or more standing",
          "When I heard about the learning of mantra, classes the monks attend during the mornings, and practices of debates in the afternoon, I somehow associate Sera Monastery to as the Tibetan training ground of Buddhism monks or Buddhism University. After 1959 Lhasa revolt, hundreds",
          "This was fun to walk around and observe the monks in their outdoor faith questioning competition. The tour through the monastery was made better by having a guide to provide historical information.",
          "Although once housing in excess of 5,000 monks, there are only about 700 monks there now (because of the PRC government). It's not really remarkable (by Tibetan standards) but, when we were there, the monks gathered for their daily 2:00 pm \"debate\", which is allowed to be",
          "Apart from the Tibetan people themselves, this was the highlight of our trip to Lhasa. Monastery was incredible, and seeing the monks debating in the square was truly awesome.",

          "Slightly out of town, would be nice to understand what each debate is about. Some of the monks are highly theatrical. Interesting.",
          "The monk debates set this monastery apart from others that I visited while in Lhasa. The debate gets crowded with tourists though, and it\u2019s difficult to hear what the monks are saying, however It\u2019s a fun way to spend an afternoon.",

          "One of the holiest sites in Tibet, beautiful in itself and very interesting to visit for the history, the spirituality, the rooms with their amazing statues and paintings. The monks debates are also very interesting!",

          "About 15 min from Lhasa- beautiful assembly hall with statue of maitreya- beautiful sand painting mandalas- wheel if life on wall- great experience to see the debating of the monks at 3 pm- 5 pm everyday",
          "That is what is the most intersting thing to see. Hundred of monks and novices are debating every afternoon outdoors and is very intersting how they made the questions with a slap of the hands and receive the answers in the same way.",
          "This is one of six main Garlung Linage monasteries n was also break ground by Zongkapa\u2019s disciples. The daily debate among the monks in the evening has become one of the tourist sight. Please do remains on the path do not disturb them nor speak loudly during the debate! Small",
          "Our group of 14 visited the Sera Monastery on 9th June 2018 in the afternoon. After obtaining entry tickets (50 CNY per person), we passed through the security gate and walked up along the stone paved path for about 250 metres, stopping on the way at a small Stupa on the right",
          "Sera Monastery was the first Monastery we visited. The most significant thing we witnessed there were the debating monks. It was interesting to watch...the monk sitting would pose the question while the monk standing would debate the issue in an apparently aggressive manner.",
          "This was the first monastery we visited on our tour so a great deal of it was eclipsed by later locations. The standouts were the beautiful Mandalas - at first glance they looked like woven carpet just from the depth of colour but were actually all created with ground stones and",

          "We visited the Sera Monastery after lunch and having visited Jokhang temple in the morning. This was a good idea as most of us were tired from the morning visit. Sera monastery was a very easy visit. We saw the \u201cso-called\u201d debate. Most of us would not call it a debate. It is",
          "If you want to see the biggest and most important Buddha, this is the place to do it! Lovely cobbled alleyways to wander around and a real hive of activity, definitely worth the visit!",
          "There is place called Debating Courtyard. You can see monk Debating as they described. Not much to see is a good to visit also.",
          "This is the home of the \"debating monks\" who argue philosophical issues with one another in a formalized, yet raucous manner. Lots of hand smacking and some yelling as 500 monks pair off to debate. The grounds are huge, with a history of 5000 monks in the past, and many empty",
          "compared to the other monasteries, like Dupong and Jokhang Temple, this Sear Monatery is not as impressive and also not as greatly maintained.",
          "You really can\u2019t see much of the monastery. But, if you go there in the afternoon you can witness their philosophical discussions, which are performed in a strange ritual of ask and answer punctuated by a hand clap.",
          "We can not say any words when we see the discussion among the Monks. They try to persuade other by words, by actions, by the sound of hand clapping. So suprised.",
          "We went to this very active, historical monastery. It is a very large facility where monks live today and continue their training. Our walk through the monastery was very interesting including getting up closer and personal with two yaks that hang out there. Only complaint",
          "The Sera Monastery is one of the largest of the Gelugpa sect. The name means wild rose garden. The monastery was named for the wild roses that grew all around the site centuries ago. At its peak it was home to over 7,000monks. Both monks and roses have diminished over time,",

          "The debating monks are fun to watch and they are obviously enjoying themselves. It is an good to see this old tradition being continued today but it is clearly arranged as a tourist attraction as it happens at 3pm every day in a courtyard with a raised section all the way round",
          "The monk debates are awesome! You are definitely going to want to spend an afternoon watching the 100 or so monks debate in the courtyard of Sera Monastery. This is one of the most culturally interesting things you can see in your stay in Lhasa. Consider i-Tibet for arranging",
          "What an experience. Watching the monks debating in the garden was a highlight of the trip. Not something you see every day, but if you can, definitely do it.",
          "Very good very respectable we were u there with my group And the atmosfere was wonderful I hope to be back again",
          "We came here to visit the debating courtyard of the Sera monastery. The entrance ticket cost 50 CNY.",
          "The debating of monks at the courtyard was just interesting because it was something different that the first time i saw it. Because tourists can not understand what monks are talking, so people find it very interesting. If tourists can see more about the real life of monks",
          "With local tour guide we went there. The location was really amazing and the view from the Monastery was jaw dropping. Loved the short hike and view. Recommended for all class travelers.",
          "Loved our visit here. Had an \"interesting\" lunch at the monastery cafe, the food was OK. The monastery was very historic, but the views were what made it memorable.",
          "We are tour and have a local guide. He took us here and the library is very interesting so don\u2019t miss that. I also enjoyed seeing all the children with black ash on their noses. The parents bring them so they can be blessed and protected. I enjoyed seeing the prayer wheel in",

          "This is the temple famous for monks debating, which usually starts at 3PM. The format is quite interesting, worth staying for the whole time, just make sure you know a bit about debating before you come. There is also a tea place in front of the temple where you can take break",
          "What makes this monastery special is the monk debate everyday at 3pm. You don't get to see that in other monasteries in Tibet or other parts of the world. They may have it but they don't open for public viewing like this one did. So, do go visit.",
          "Visiting the Sera Monastery gives you a different perspective on life. Very calming and spiritual. No pictures allowed inside so be respectful.",
          "In November there were few vistors, no lines; which meant we had all the time we wanted to take in the peace and beauty of the monastery",
          "We visited in the afternoon and were able to take in the monks' debate which was very interesting. Pretty grounds and interesting architecdture.",
          "We decided to visit Sera principally for the monks' debate, famous for its dramatic hand slapping. It quickly became apparent that every other tourist in Lhasa was doing the same. It was also obvious that a lot of the young monks were playing up for the cameras leaving us",

          "It has many streets, many buildings and many levels with steps. This set is limed, repaired, cleaned by many volunteers who are available for these jobs. It is one of the monastery with stays, images, practices and organization of thousands of years ago. For festivals that are",

          "We stopped here only briefly, but there's a beautiful, tree-lined main alley leading up to the top and the temple buildings. We got here a little late, but there were monks chanting for a while, which then led to monks debating (which of course, we completely could not",
          "The name Sera is becasue \"Sera\" trees used to grow in this area. Home to about 500 monks and Sera is one of the three great monasteries in the area. In the courtyard you will find debating monks in pairs taking each other on phylosophical questions. Well organised but noisy",

          "Amazing experience. Very medieval. You must see the monks debating. Quite extraordinary. Great way to spend the morning. Well maintained and at the entrance there are nice restaurants to stop and have lunch. Very impresssive architecture and history. Again - you cannot visit",
          "Small monastery compared to others but the afternoon debating sessions held by the monks are a unique experience. Some relish the audience & play up to the crowd, others seem distraught if they get an answer wrong. No debates on Sundays",
          "We came here on a Friday afternoon and the debate was around half past 3. It was interesting and impressed us a lot. Our children liked to see it. It take about 2 hours, remember to take passports etc if you come here by yourself. There are many travelers, also lots of guides",

          "Smaller monastery but more authentic I do not think the debute is only for the tourists, few days lated I read an article in a local newspaper about this tradition",
          "This temple nothing much to see. But the most special is the debate show among the monks at the certain time. The other specialty is that a buddha with the head lean to the left hand side because she/he wants to listen to the debating of the monks. Really amazing experience.",
          "The monastery was founded at the beginning of the 15th Century. There's an Assembly Hall, three colleges and thirty three houses. Watch out for the debating monks in the afternoon. Some people commented that the debating seemed a bit artificial but we did not get that",
          "A must to visit while in Lhasa, especially to see the daily monk debates (avoid Sunday's as it's a holiday)",
          "The monastery is touristy and the debate in the garden, anything but authentic. Was expecting some kind of dialogue or discussion audible to spectators but only got to see exaggerated hand gestures and clapping of hands as pairs of monks appear to be in the act of questioning",
          "take your cell phone (no cameras allowed) to document the monks debating - fascinating experience to behold!",
          "It is a nice monastery, but the best part is the monks' discussion. Very interesting and worthy to experience.",

          "A lot of chapels, to many Buddhas and Dalais Lama. I didn't appreciate a beauty of the construction from outside and such monasteries are a kind of chaotic distribution inside. Open chapels, cold, very similar with one and the other, same that only buddhist experts or devotes",

          "Very close to Lhasa and can easily be seen in an hour or two. The highlight of this Monastery is the Monk's debate. Stay for 15 minutes and watch the hand clapping style of debating. Quite interesting. It is very odd that the local security do not allow cameras to be used",
          "Every afternoon there is a chance to see how monks practice their arguments by questioning, raising voice, clapping hands and answering. All do not take it so seriously, take it easy yourself. To see it 10-15 minutes is definitely enough. No came photos allowed but mobile phones",

          "This was one of my favorite things I did in Lhasa. We only saw the debates and didn't walk around the monastery, which was fine since we went to several others. The debate itself was unlike any kind of western debate. It was entertaining even for those of us who understood not a",

          "In comparison with the other Lhasa highlights like Potala or Jongkang this is very disappointing. As there are only few rooms to be visited, this is probably not worth the time unless you are spending a longer time in Lhasa. The highlight here is of course the debating",
          "Sera Monastery, like Drepung Monastery nearby, is one of the great monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism and a popular spot for tourists. Set against a backdrop of mountains, it makes for a good photographic experience. One of the highlights of a visit is watching the monks debate in",
          "A good place to visit and to see the famous debate of the monks. Inside the monastery is a place under the trees for debates. It is quite interesting how the standing monk asks a question to the sitting monk and if the answer is right he poses a gesture along with the clap and",

          "Watch monks debate their theory in open forum. Note the clapping is shutting down of negativity ( hell realms) and the studying monks use of the mala is to pull the practicing buddhist up to be supported. Close near lhasa this is a great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Another vast monastery in Lhasa. The thing that makes this one interesting is the monk debate. There is a \"debate square\" where about 30 or so monks debate scripture with each other every afternoon. My guide described it as touristic, but it was still enjoyable. The rest of the",
          "It seemed like the primary reason tourists visit the Sera Monastery is to witness the Monks debating session in the open air courtyard. It is a lively and animated debate between what looks like a senior monk and a student...although there is no way to understand what they are",

          "Watching the monks debates was the high light of the tour..plenty of chances of photos of the mountain view and monastery and meeting monks.",
          "Not interesting for people outside Tibet, they use language that even difficult for Tibetans to understand, the only thing to do is observing the tones and gestures from the monks during debate.",
          "Here we got to see the monks debate Buddhist philosophy with each other. To see them drill each other, slap their hands before each question and encircle the monks head with their beads if the answer is wrong was fascinating.",
          "I have been to Sera before, in 2000. Then, as now, the main attraction is the area in which the monks actively discuss theological issues by challenging each other in a traditional way - one sitting down, the other standing and putting questions with 'aggressive' hand",
          "The monastery is quite run down and dirty. It used to have space for a great number of monks, but only a couple of hundreds are left. So most parts feel deserted. Having said that, we enjoyed the debating time of the monks which takes place every afternoon.",
          "There are some places super unique to the culture. This is one. Go & watch the debating monks. I assure you, it is fascinating!!",
          "An experience not to be missed if only to witness the animated discourse of young monks in rowdy but formal debate. Take your camera and use video mode if you have it available",

          "Very interesting library room here, showing the old castes for printing. Try to visit in the afternoon, at 3pm all the monks are called to the courtyard for a debating session",
          "Very entertaining, even though we could not understand what was being said, though we were aware that the method of clapping of the hands (by the standing questioner) would indicate if the sitting respondent was right or wrong in his answers. Somewhat theatrical and geared",
          "The Monastery is rundown and needs a lot of attention, but the Monks still gather daily during the week to \"argue philosophical questions\". one is allowed into the courtyard to watch, but as in almost everyplace in Lhasa, the police are all over and you are watched constantly.",
          "Try to go between 3-5 PM to see the monks debating. It looks like they are arguing, but they are just very passionate about their debates. The hand slaps either depict a question or a wrong answer depending on whether the hand is up or down. You can also visit their printing",

          "This monastery is a very old monastery just outside of Lhasa. It was fun to see the monks debating every afternoon at 3 pm. There are some special sand shrines inside this monastery are good to catch if you have the chance. If at all possible go to the restroom before you",
          "Another complex that ties together the Buddhist life in Lhasa. The monk's open debate is a treat not to be missed by an outside visitor.",
          "At one time 5000, monks would here, now a mere 500, visit in the morning, debating is held in the court yard, all monks are in their garb , although you cant understand but the gestures of the debater can be seen in action.",
          "We went to this one after seeing three others but were still awed by the enormity and complexity of it all. Like the others it is the maze of interior rooms, chambers and halls containing hundreds if not thousands of Buddhist stautes, many In gold plate, that takes your breath",
          "Loved watching the monks debate, stayed for a half hour or more and watched from different points. Although we didn't understand what was being said, it looked like the older monks were intimidating the younger monks with their questions. Most younger monks got \"palms up\" for",

          "This was the first monastery we visited in Lhasa... its beautiful, and there is series of stairs that lead to an observation platform... it might take a while to get there, but its with the gasping and the climb. Pace yourself. Don't mind the dogs lounging about sleeping...they",
          "A little climb up to the monastery. Very peaceful setting with monks chanting mauntras. Nice and peaceful setting. Beautiful architecture.",
          "Together with Drepung and the Potala Palace, not to be missed. Interesting paintings, famous for its \"debate among monks\" although rather commercialized and one of the main universities.",
          "We had an aytpical experience watching some sort of exam in which an older monk challenged or questioned a younger monk for 30+ minutes while all others watched. The younger monk didn't seem to be doing so well... Still an interesting ceremony to watch.",
          "There are hundreds of monk debating at the garden of this monastery everyday. It was a fascinating view even though we don't understand what they say.",
          "Monasteries are monasteries in Tibet but this is something else. The buildings are like any other monastery but it's only a short drive from Lhasa and it's worth it just to see the antics of the debating monks. Dramatically punching the air or their palms etc to stress their",

          "The monastery, while reasonably interesting, is not nearly as interesting as the Potala Palace in our opinion. The monks' debate, however, even though one cannot understand the words (unless one speaks Tibetan), is a fascinating event. As others have stated, the entire monastery",
          "The air of the spirits being all around you as you walked around was evident at Sera. We went up further into the mountains, and I think it is the highest I will ever be in the himalayas. Huge Mongolian, Chinese, Tibetan, Indian and Nepalese influences - It is after all a",
          "This is a true monastery. But, all you can really see is the monk debate -- the debate seems more like a show for tourists. We all sat in a controlled circle around about 100 monks who were paired in a kind of exam or verbal exchange. I'm sure they were actually doing some",
          "Well kept site, very authentic. Reasonably priced and not too busy. You are able to see monks debating which is a very different/ interesting experience. I would really recommend visiting the monastery",
          "A non highlight. Went to see monks debating in late afternoon... Boring! Mangy stray dogs all over. Needed to use the bathroom.. Have travelled the world and never been in a more filthy disgusting bathroom in my life. Needed to wash and disinfect everything after that experience!",
          "The most interesting portion of this monastery is watching the monks debate their religious interpretations. Fun and lively, and not to be missed.",

          "About 30 min by car out of the center Sera Monastery sits on the outskirts of Lhasa. It is another typical Lhasa temple/monastery architecture with history but Sera is special because you can visit a section called the debating area. You can be entertained by scores of monks",
          "I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this place, but it grew on me. Sad that there are so few monks left here, it must have been amazing at the height of its glory. The monks have a certain debate style they follow, and it's fun to watch.",
          "Worth to set alarm early and enjoy walking few hours with the local Tibetan people. You can photography freely outside the monastery. Sure, I see sign of price for photos and videos, just don't do it, why would you want to photography the buddha. _ Not everything need to be",

          "Unless you are a devout Buddhist, some of the monastery has basically the same stuff. Demanding payment of 25 to 1500yuen for photos/videos of similar structure is in my opinion not necessary. Other than scenery, Tibet only other significant attraction is temple so after seeing",
          "We experienced living monastery with monks, even though in so much reduced number only 300 out of 10.000 in the past. Worth to visit and use imagination.",
          "Sera monastery once held numerous theological colleges. Now there is only one, but it provides a special moment. Each afternoon around 15:00, the monks test each other out in a courtyard, by pairing up and questioning each other via a robust series of gestures, full-arm",
          "We were lucky enough to tour this peaceful and picturesque monastery when the monks had their debating afternoon. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Lhasa",

          "Again our guide and driver from Tibet Ctrip got us there even with the 40k/hr speed limit. Seeing the monks debate was an absolute highlight for me. Driving from Lhasa through the mud brick and yak dung villages is a sight and experience that can only be lost as time passes.",

          "The monks were quiet and going about their business of taking care of the temple. I heard there's only 500 monks when there were thousands before. Most housing around temple seems abandoned as there aren't enough monks to fill them. Nice to see monks doing what they normally do",
          "Sera Monastery is stunning and very peaceful. I loved being there and watching the monks debate in the afternoon. However, I feel that they are being somewhat used and capitalised on by the Chinese who are promoting holidays in the region to benefit their own pockets;",

          "Most of the buildings inside the gate look rather run down and in need of repairs. Things seemed to move at a very fast pace. The monks were closing the temple at around 3pm. They actually pushed us through the various areas to get us out. Then we were led to an area outside",

        "wiki": "'Drepung Monastery (Tibetan: \u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0f74\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54, Wylie: bras spungs dgon pa, THL: dr\u00e9pung g\u00f6npa, \"Rice Heap Monastery\"), located at the foot of Mount Gephel, is one of the \"great three\" Gelug university gompas (monasteries) of Tibet. The other two are Ganden Monastery and Sera Monastery.\nDrepung is the largest of all Tibetan monasteries and is located on the Gambo Utse mountain, five kilometers from the western suburb of Lhasa.\nFreddie Spencer Chapman reported, after his 1936-37 trip to Tibet, that Drepung was at that time the largest monastery in the world, and housed 7,700 monks, \"but sometimes as many as 10,000 monks.\"Since the 1950s, Drepung Monastery, along with its peers Ganden and Sera, have lost much of their independence and spiritual credibility in the eyes of Tibetans since they operate under the close watch of the Chinese security services.  All three were reestablished in exile in the 1950s in Karnataka state in south India.  Drepung and Ganden are in Mundgod and Sera is in Bylakuppe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDrepung Monastery was founded in 1416 by Jamyang Choge Tashi Palden (1397\u20131449), one of Tsongkhapa's main disciples, and it was named after the sacred abode in South India of Shridhanyakataka.\nDrepung was the principal seat of the Gelugpa school and it retained the premier place amongst the four great Gelugpa monasteries. The Ganden Phodrang (dga\u00b4 ldan pho brang) in Drepung was the residence of the Dalai Lamas until the Great Fifth Dalai Lama constructed the Potala. Drepung was known for the high standards of its academic study, and was called the Nalanda of Tibet, a reference to the great Buddhist monastic university of India.\nOld records show that there were two centres of power in Drepung: the so-called lower chamber (Zimkhang 'og ma) \nassociated with the Dalai Lamas-to-be, and the upper chamber (Zimkhang gong ma) associated with the descendants of Sonam Drakpa, an illustrious teacher who died in 1554. The estate of the Dalai Lamas at Drepung Monastery, called Ganden Phodrang, had been constructed in 1518 by Gendun Gyatso Palzangpo (1476\u20131541), retrospectively named and counted as 2nd Dalai Lama. The name of the Tibetan government established by the 5th Dalai Lama came from the name of this estate.\nPenchen S\u00f6nam Drakpa (1478-1554 CE) in 1535 succeeded Gend\u00fcn Gyatso (1476\u20131541) on the Throne of Drepung, both of them being major figures in the history of the Geluk tradition.  By the time S\u00f6nam Drakpa was appointed to the Throne of Drepung (Drepung Tri), he was already a famous Geluk master. He had already occupied the Throne of Ganden (Ganden Tri) and was considered the most prolific and important Geluk thinker of his time. His successor was none other than S\u00f6nam Gyatso (1543-1588 CE), the lama who would receive the official title of the Third Dalai Lama (Tal\u00e9 Lama Kutreng Sumpa).\nBefore his death in 1554, S\u00f6nam Drakpa established his own estate, the Upper Chamber (Zimkhang Gongma), which was named because of its location at the top of Drepung, just below the Ngakpa debating courtyard \"Ngagpa Dratshang\".\nTibetan Buddhist Resource Center attributes the following Name variants to Penchen S\u00f6nam Drakpa: \"bsod nams grags pa [primaryName], paN chen bsod nams grags pa [title], khri 15 bsod nams grags pa [primaryTitle], rtses thang paN chen bsod nams grags pa [title],\ngzims khang gong ma 01 bsod nams grags pa [title], this last one referring to the Seat of the Upper Chamber established in 1554. According to TBRC his successors referring to the estate of the Zimkhang Gongma were Sonam Yeshe Wangpo (1556\u201392), Sonam Gelek Palzang (1594\u20131615) and Tulku Dragpa Gyaltsen (1619\u20131656) - closely connected to the famous story of Dorje Shugden. (Some say that Drakpa Gyeltsen was S\u00f6nam Drakpa\u2019s second reincarnation, but usually he is considered to be the 4th incarnation of Panchen Sonam Dragpa). It seems to be commonly accepted that Dragpa Gyaltsen was the fourth holder of the gzims khang gong ma incarnation line. According to Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center gzims khang gong ma 04 grags pa rgyal mtshan has been his \"primaryTitle\". Since the search for his reincarnation has been banned, he has been the last one.\nChapman reported that in the late 1930s Drepung was divided into four colleges, each housing monks from a different locality: \"one being favoured by Khampas, another by Mongolians, and so on.\" Each college was presided over by an abbot who had been appointed by the late 13th Dalai Lama.Drepung is now divided into what are known as the seven great colleges: Gomang (sGo-mang), Loseling (Blo-gsal gling), Deyang (bDe-dbyangs), Shagkor (Shag-skor), Gyelwa (rGyal-ba) or Tosamling (Thos-bsam gling), Dulwa (\u2018Dul-ba), and Ngagpa (sNgags-pa).  It can be a somewhat useful analogy to think of Drepung as a university along the lines of Oxford or the Sorbonne in the Middle Ages, the various colleges having different emphases, teaching lineages, or traditional geographical affiliations.\nAccording to local sources, today the population at the monastery in Lhasa is about 300 monks, due to population capping enforced by the Chinese government. However, the institution has continued its tradition in exile with campuses in South India on land in Karnataka given to the Tibetan community in exile by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.  The monastery in India today houses over 5,000 celibate monks, with around 3,000 at Drepung Loseling and some 2,000 at Drepung Gomang. Hundreds of new monks are admitted each year, many of them refugees from Tibet.\nThe Ganden-Phodrang-Palace situated at Drepung Monastery was constructed by the 2nd Dalai Lama in 1518  and declared his chief residence/governmental palace until the inauguration of Potala Palace by the 5th Dalai Lama.\n\n\n== Recent events ==\nAbout 40% of the old monastic town was destroyed after the Chinese arrived in Lhasa in 1951, though luckily the chief buildings including the four colleges, the Tsokchen and the Dalai Lamas' residence were preserved.Drepung monastery was shut down by Chinese authorities on 14 March 2008, after monk-led protests against Chinese rule turned violent and businesses, shops and vehicles were looted and torched. The People's Republic of China claims that 22 people were killed in the riots but Tibetan sources put the figure much higher. The International Herald Tribune reported that the monastery reopened 2013 after being shut for five years.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDorje, Gyurme.

          "We spent about 3 hours here the day after visiting Potala Palace so that was a hard act to follow. Unless you want to see lots of monasteries then I'd recommend Potala as sufficient.",
          "If you only have time for one monastery visit in Lhasa make it this one. Beautiful buildings, setting and atmosphere in spades. History and religion ooze out of the walls. Gorgeous views across Lhasa and to the mountains beyond.",
          "This place is one of the 6 important \"Yellow Hat\" monasteries. Damaged during the cultural revolution it has been reconstructed and offers now a great introduction to the tibetian budhism. Once you are there try to explore also the \"kora\" area behind main buildings. Its a nice",
          "This was the 1st place visited in lhasa... it is quite extensive and highlights the details of Buddhism.. it has quite a bit of steps to climb.. but the guide stops at each point explaining something so it breaks the monotony. It's a quite a vast place and has quite a few steps",
          "This monastery is a must-see for anyone making the trip to Lhasa. It's perched on a hillside with great views, and the monks who reside there keep it very well maintained. The interior of some of the chapels and assembly hall are absolutely breathtaking: I'll let the photos",
          "After Jokhang temple, the most beautiful monastery in Lhasa! With the visit of these two monasterie you can",
          "We were taken here first and worn out after seeing everything. Lots of halls of same type. I recommend telling your guide how thoroughly you want to explore it. Certainly after hours here don't head to Sera Monastery next.",
          "It is a big monastery that will probably take you hours to see it all. It is the biggest monastery in the city of Lhasa. It locates by western outskirt (or will soon become inskirt) of Lhasa. It costs money to go in, same as Jokkhang and Sera. I did a walk by its east ridge on",
          "This is the largest of Tibetan monasteries and perhaps the most historic. It preserves some of the old Buddhist colleges and the Dalai Lama's residence. If you are not too familiar with the history of Tibetan Buddhism, this is an excellent place to learn a few things.",
          "Many different artifacts, many worshiping Buddhist pilgrims and spectacular views. Be sure you have a good guide. physically demanding.",
          "A smaller and unique monastery. Each monastery visited in Lhasa has its own unique atmosphere, look and feel. This was no exception.",
          "The Monastery is fantastic. I'm told there are 450 monks residing here though there were once 10,000. OF course you need to visit the Patola Palace and Serra monastery when in Lhasa, but don't miss this one. The great assembly hall is amazing. The surrounding chapels are also",
          "The place is massive. You need to climb up the small hill to reach the main monastery. But in Lhasa it also is a task with less Oxigen. The monastery it self is very nice, with beautiful views of Lhasa and the river across. At one point it was one of most important monastery in",
          "This monastery is built into the mountain side and used to house 10,000 + monks. Because of social and government imposed conditions, they are down to less than 500. Nevertheless, it is a huge place where teaching continues and young monks continue their training and social",
          "Just returned from our visit and am in awe. The past two days was the celebration of the 600th year anniversary of the founding of the monastery. The monks in the great hall were cleaning up the hundreds of gifts of prayer scarfs and sweeping up the donations of small bills.",
          "A beautiful monastery at the base of the mountains just outside Lhasa. I loved the network of little ally ways, while watching the monks coming and going. Definitely a must see when in Lhasa.",
          "In this monastery you'll get to see a lot of statues. It takes about half a day to visit, is definitely worth this time.",
          "Drepung Monastery is the second largest of Lhasa's three great monasteries, attached to Drepng is Niching Monastery, the sea of Tibet's great oracle. It is worth a visit!",
          "This is the larger of the two major monasteries on the outskirts of Lhasa the other being Sera Monastery. There is more to see here and the views are better as the monastery is on the side of the mountain. Definitely worthwhile. Some of the temple rooms and halls were similar",
          "Impressive, Awe-inspiring with a good view over surrounding country. Historically important. We were happy, that we saw this monastery before our visit to the Potala, because it fits chronologicaly into the history. Our Tourguide Tennyi from Sichuan China International Travel",
          "Tibetan monasteries are usually very noisy and busy in August with hundreds of chinese tourist pushing you araound instead Drepung is quiet and intimate, views are amazing and the village around the monastery is very picturesque with its labyrinth of white walls and local people",
          "Nice place to see woman and men monks. Amazing manual printing works where using Middle Ages process they do a great job to print ceremonial protocols. You can see original wooden tables 400 years old. Give 20RMB to the guy and he will show you everything around its job. All",
          "It would be unusual for Drepung not to feature on your organised tour itinerary. The complex is massive and an attack to senses. Don't miss the climb above that big mural for some nice views.",
          "Built in 1416, it was once the largest monastery in Tibet, housing more than ten thousand monks! I particularly like the tranquility of this monastery. It's definitely worth visiting, just look at the pictures!",
          "This is the biggest monastery college with 22 colleges, on a rainy day it had a magical quality with laces of clouds encircling the colleges at different levels... Theres a 3 storied Maitreya statue thats worth a visit!",
          "This was our first monastery visited when we arrived in Tibet. It is a nice introduction to the area and gets you used to high altitude stair climbing, which you will do a lot of during your visit to Lhasa! This is the largest monastery and was home to the Dalai Lama prior to",
          "Drepung is one of many nice Monasteries in Lhasa that are worthwhile visiting. We had spent two (2) full days touring Lhasa and we had the opportunity to visit the Drepung, Sera, Jokhang and Potala Monasteries - all different and worthwhile stops to visit and enjoy the views.",
          "Visiting \"Drepung Monastery\" is not for beginners. Take your time, go slowly and try to adapt yourself to the high altitudes of the Gambo Utse Mountain. It is tough, it is hard, steps and more steps to climb. Headaches and difficulties to breath. But it is immensely rewarding:",
          "This was the highlight of our tour in Tibet. We got lucky to watch monk debates. It was quite interesting. There's a stair hike to the top so make sure you take your time walking up since most of us travelers get altitude sickness. You can get dizzy so just walk slowly. Also use",
          "Beautiful monastery, but you can find plenty of them in Tibet. What is really special about it is Lama debating. Every afternoon (except Sundays) you can see the debate and even that they speak the language you dont understand it is still fascinating :)",
          "We came here at around 5 pm and entrance is 60 RMB. This is the biggest of the 3 monasteries in and around Lhasa. However, there isn't much to see even though the complex is pretty big. We stayed less than an hour. If you have to choose between visiting Drepung or Sera",
          "It's as fascinating as any other Tibetan monasteries, but with its' unique attraction - a hill to allow you to appreciate the beautiful landscape and skyline from a higher point. So you must walk to the top of this monastery, through the long long staircases. It will be a bit",
          "This is one of the three monasteries that should be considered when visiting Lhasa (Sera and Jokhang are the other two). Packed full of intensely religious decoration and artefacts, the branch of Buddhism practiced is a fascinating mixture of the ancient pre-buddhist gods",
          "Take it slowly,slowly. It is situated a little higher than Lhasa. This was the biggest Temple in Tibet.A must pilgrimage for many Tibetans. Has many interesting and unique features.",
          "Before liberation, ten thousand monks resided here make it the largest monastery in Tibet.Thangkhas silk scrolls here are very precious & rare in the world, including many Buddhist scriptures & other cultural relics. The area covers over 200 thousand square meters. Although the",
          "The Deprung Monastery is an interesting attraction. Lots of history here. Not as spectacular as the Potala Palace but worth a look.",
          "Lovely old white buildings in shadow of the black mountain. It was the palace of the Dalai Lama before reconstructin of Potala Palace. Take your time to wander round this impressive building, its atmosphere and decorations.",
          "Located at the foot of one of the many rocky and majestic slopes that surround Lhasa, Drepung Monaestery is (high in altitude, don'y try to keep walking peace with the Tibetans if you've just arrived) surrounded by striking scenery. The monks still keep a hand-operated printing",
          "Recommend having a tour guide for your visit to any monastery or temple near Lhasa, or it's going to be a similar experience to any of the other monasteries nearby. Key differences at Drepung Monastery * You can take a look in the kitchens, where you can still see the huge vats",
          "We had very limited time here so unfortunately we were not able to see the entire monastery, however, it was beautiful, peaceful and spiritual.",
          "lovely place. a bit of a climb but worth it. a place where they would have 8000 monks gather for ceremonial functions with the head lhamas.gorgeous views of valley.clear blue skies",
          "Situated a little outside of Lhasa and is really a hidden treasure. It is easy to get there, but can have many tourists.",
          "With a 600-year history, Drepung is one of the most important monasteries of the Gelukpa School of Tibetan Buddhism. About 80 years ago it was the largest monastery in the world, with as many as 10,000 monks, though the number today is much smaller. While monasteries can get",
          "Such an amazing place! Set in the side of a mountain, Drepung has all the mystique you'd expect from a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. The rock-art, many chapels and shrines, etc. are fascinating in themselves. The highlight of our visit was witnessing the monk debate outside the",
          "This place is quite big as it has many colleges of Tibetan studies. Good place for hiking to the top and the view is quite fascinating. There are many statues of Dalai Lama and Lord Buddha and many ancient sculptures. It was good to experience the Buddhism religion at such a",
          "There is a great deal of history with this monastery - it was home to the early Dalai Lamas. A good guide is key to help you understand the importance of this place. At one time it was the home to 10,000 monks with only 300 residing today. It also remains as an important",
          "Arriving at this monastery, you get great views of Lhasa and the surrounding hillside. Exploring the monastery, you get a great sense of history and peace. It is one of the largest in all of Tibet. Get your guide to show you around and you will learn a lot.",
          "Drepung is one of the major Gelugpa monasteries. It has retained four of its original colleges and has about 300 monks. The buildings are magnificent as are the paintings on the hillside behind. Drepung was the place chosen by the early Dalai Lamas, until the 5th moved to the",
          "This monastery used to hold well over 10,000 monks. There are only about 300 now a days. The reasons for this are many and there is no specific one reason. This is a gigantic complex of buildings and colleges built on a hill side. You can see the original kitchen which used to",
          "Lime the other Buddhist Monasteries this one is quite magnificent from the outside but it's the interior with a huge collection of Buddhist statues, many in gold, that is most interesting. As with the others be warned there are lots of steps and it is at altitude but well worth",
          "the largest of all Tibetan monasteries with a university, interesting rooms including their enormous kitchen, nice view from the patio, and now rather commercial - if you want to watch a \"debate\" of monks this is the place.",
          "A bit out of the center or Lhasa but stunning views and wonderful treasures throughout the complex. More aggressive begging here than elsewhere which was less pleasant but still worth a visit.",
          "Loved this monastery out of all we've visited. Lovely Tibetian architecture and alleys in the huge monastery - our guide told us it is home to 10,000 monks. Ask your guide for the history of the place and be blown away. Loads of chambers and chapels to visit so it will take at",
          "Beautiful interior decor like all the monasteries we have seen in Tibet and China.I enjoyed discovering the huge kitchen and seeing how they previously fed the 6000 monks who lived here before the cultural revolution.Now there are only 500 here.A word of warning.. stone floors",
          "You could easily spend half a day at this monastery; it is huge and has many buildings, temples, and caves. When we visited, Saga Dawa was just starting so we saw many pilgrims giving donations of money and yak butter. It was such a unique experience. The artwork, statues, and",
          "an olefactory overload! I have never in my life seen such reverence and commercialism side by side, yet the Tibetans do it so respectfully. The waft of yak butter candle incense is etched into my memory forever! Go see it!",
          "This is another active monastery where you can see many statues and observe the monks going through their daily routines. Historically important also due to the uprising in 2008, this monastery is undergoing some new building and repairs. The monk population is now controlled at",
          "Drepung Monastery is a must see place in Tibet. It looks like a fortress with many steps make by stone and there are many corners turn you to no-where. Yes very easy to be lost here because there are many things around to see. Come to main praying place you will see plenty seat",
          "Drepung Monastery is set on the outskirts of Lhasa on the foot of a mountain. It is similar to other religous sites but every monastery/temple serves a purpose and has a story and unique display, design and art depicts them. Again your best to have a local tour guide (we had a",
          "Despite the reduction in numbers of monks from several thousand to a few hundred, and despite tourist traffic, it is still possible to get the feeling of a monastic city from the maze of alleyways, and Tibetan worshipers still scurry among the tourists, giving their small money",
          "The monastary is huge but the main attraction is the great assembly hall. Pay the extra to take pictures as it is so colorful.",
          "This monastery is easy to visit from Lhasa and was the head monastery of the Dali lamas before they moved to the Potala. There are many buildings and chapels to explore.",
          "Beautiful location, and one of the few places round Lhasa where you can (for a fee) take photographs inside the monastery rooms to capture the internal decoration and atmosphere. Very special.",
          "Original monastery/palace of the Dalai Lamas until the 5th (who had the Potala Palace built). Still a monastery, although much smaller than the 7,000 monks it had at one time. A steep walk from the parking area, although every where in Tibet is a steep walk and at altitude.",
          "I particularly enjoyed the debating episodes amongst the monks in the monastery. They debate generally in groups of about 5 with many groups debating at the same time. There is lots of drama and quite enjoyable to watch.",
          "To really appreciate the monastery you must visit it in January when all the Pilgrims come in their native dress with their Yak butter to fuel the candles. It is a spectacle and the interior will amaze you to say the least-----definitely worth your time.",
          "We visited Drepung Monastery as part of our private tour of Lhasa. Drepung Monastery located in the western suburb of Lhasa is one of the 'Three Great Monasteries of Tibet'. We understand it is one of the most reputed centres for learning, contemplating and practicing Tibetan",
          "It was nice wandering around the monastery grounds, feeling like you've walked into a different age.",
          "This was one of our last of the monasteries we visited in Tibet on 26th Sept, 2014 and by this time, we were fully knowlegeable about Tibetan Budhism, Lamas, monks, air burial, thangkas, kalachakras etc... There was a small walk way while you enter this place from your car park",
          "We came here after sightseeing elsewhere so I was tired. The cold weather plus the high altitude made it harder for me to walk and climb the stairs. The stairs were steep and some were wobbly. You have to be careful walking as it was dark inside. It was slippery where there",
          "I have never been anywhere like the Drepung Monastery. Watching the people with the butter and the prayers was amazing. We were the only non Asian people there. My only recommendation is if you have trouble with stairs, avoid this place. You would not be happy. Many of the",
          "Once the home of 10,000 monks, the 200-300 now allowed by the authorities rattle around the place. Wonderful chapels and buddhas to see and you will learn a lot about Buddhism.",
          "We visited Drepung Monastery as the last stop of a long day, after the Potala Palace and Norbulingka. Altitude sickness hit us there for the first time (and thankfully the only time) in Tibet, and I ended up having to take a sit every 3 minutes to rest while attempting my way",
          "It was a great place to see but I would say it was best to go no a private tour they is so much history about the place but not many signs to read about each part.",
          "I suggest you stroll up around the mountains behind the monastery as this gives great views of the entire complex, the older ruins and newer temples sitting side by side. The monastery follows the contours of the mountains, working its way up the mountainside. Up here there are",
          "lovely monastery, thangka, kora, is not that busy compare to Ganden Monastery,therefore you can truly enjoy",
          "I don't like the stairs as age, weight and altitude work against me. That said I was glad I made the effort to visit the chapels and learn a little of the history of this monastery. The statues, paintings and architecture appealed to me quite a lot. Be aware that under the",
          "As with all the monastery's you feel like you have stepped back in time. The history and authentic feel of the place is not to be missed. i am fascinated with the butter candles and watching all the people honor the Buddha's",
          "On the whole Lhasa was a disappointment however the monastery was one of the highlights. The crowds were manageable and the Monastery was interesting with beautiful artwork.",
          "This monastery is distinguished from many others by the sheer number of monks housed in its sprawling grounds in the hills above Lhasa. With six temples within its compound, it also the largest and perhaps the longest walk uphill of those in Lhasa. It is worth the climb as the",
          "not many visitors, being away from the tour group is always a plus. you can enjoy the time by closely observe the lama activities here and worship the buddha freely, lama are friendly and they are willing to share fabulous stories with you, if you could communicate",
          "I really enjoyed seeing this building. We had a great guide who could explain all the parts of the building to us. Still lots of stairs, bring your water. Oh, here they were restoring the murals, very interesting.",
          "OK, many in Tibet have very little material things but they have everything that really matters to them. Could not believe how moved we were being with the monks and the chanting. It really was wonderful. The sights and sounds have to be experienced. Go.. be moved.",
          "This was one of the first monasteries we visited on our Tibet tour. It was pretty big and we appreciated having a guide to explain everything to us. We were also lucky to be there for the annual debating which involved a Yellow Head monk sitting in the middle of he assembly hall",
          "It was the first monastery I got to see, which made it all that more amazing. Great view of the city. A lot of climbing on the fist days in Lhasa, can be hard if you are not acclimated to the altitude. Definitely need a guide to explain all the details there.",
          "Enjoyed the opportunity to see so many different temples/monasteries, while they look the same on the outside there are individual differences that are worth exploring.",
          "This is a monastery which is quite demanding as it is a stiff climb to reach the various sections. However, every inch gained is worth it. This, I believe, is the seat of the Panchen Lama.",
          "Just like many other monastery in Lhasa, Drepung Monastery has similar structures, buddhas, stupas etc. What stands out is that they have this huge Thangka (which was kept in the cupboard when i was there) to hang out during festivals. Overall this place is huge to walk around,",
          "we went to see the drepung during the day of the yoghurt festival. The only time of the year when the show a huge tanka outside on the mountain side. a hundred thousand people go there for pilgrimage and prayer and we had the feeling to be the only europeans in the masses. It",
          "This monastery is full of color and stairs !!!! Every chapel has its own interest. The monastery is full of life and many of the pilgrims have with them their dogs so in some areas there is a mixture of hymns and dog bells.",
          "Lots of monastary to see but like this one as we had a very good guide,Tibetan The weather was good so that made the difference.You will find a smell in all monastery because of the fat burning from the candles etc but well worth the visit.",
          "This monastery is located at the foot of Mount Gephel and great three Gelukpa University monasteries of Tibet. This monastery must visit you can see all kinds of old architecture and outside the temple you can see the beautiful view.",
          "Inside Drepung are some of the most beautiful thangkas (paintings) you could find. The monastery is a bit of a hike from the place where the bus lets you off (unless you are in a tour van). Take your time going up the hill. And remember to walk clockwise when you get to the",
          "A beautiful and very important place for Tibetans.  It's worth visiting.  The monks usually debate in a courtyard in the morning but they were not there when we visited.",
          "Other than the debating that makes sera monastery unique, this had a nicer location and more history in my opinion! Well worth the visit!",
          "Though you may get tired of the yak butter offerings and burning incense, it is well worth it to go through every monastery and temple you can. You may never have the chance to come here again, so don't miss it!",
          "a relaxed place to slowly experience a monastery. Monks were friendlier here than most places. Views are excellent.",
          "Once one of the largest monasteries in the world (10,000 monks or more). Somewhat diminished from its glory days, it now has the air of a museum - except for the Tibetan pilgrims who will be found in every chapel, every nook and cranny of this place, breathing life into it. Well",
          "The buildings are amazing, got some wonderful pictures. When we were there it had clouds coming down and around the monastery, made it look so magical. Waking around inside felt very special, seeing the monks studying.",
          "Enjoyed going up to see this old and impressive monastery. The fact that its inhabited by so many monks gives you a better sense of their daily lives (eg, visiting the kitchen, etc). The sad part is that tourism has attracted many people old and young begging for money. Overall,",
          "serene and beautiful. as usual a nice long climb so wear good shoes. no photographs are allowed inside. views are good and you get a chance to absorb the atmosphere and look at the beautiful frescos and art. worth a visit",
          "Not far away from Lhasa, Drepung is a must. Although it requires strong legs and lungs to get to the main Hall, it's certainly worth the effort. A visit to the Kitchen is also worth it. The Assembly Hall is a masterpiece! Care should be taken not to lose your way to the coach",
          "Arriving at Drepung which is the biggest Tibetan Buddhism College, after buying our entrance tickets we go through an airport type security check then get back in our van for an uphill drive. Navigating some construction areas we start our now traditional \u201cMonastery StairMaster",
          "Dregung monastery is a large place, yet fairly easy to navigate with a guide. Lots of rooms and buddhas, Thankas, and art to see. The people you encounter are wonderful also. The joy the Tibetans have at being there. Wow. I'm sorry not to know this place in its heyday with",
          "Beautiful temples, amazing statues - a really great experience. Sad that today the monks are required to collect a separate photo fee for every single temple & meeting hall with all the money going to the government - its not that we minded paying the fees [they were reasonable",

          "A great piece of history worth seeing. We were lucky that there were very few tourists when we came so we really got to enjoy each of the rooms in the monastery. Views are wonderful!",
          "What I like about this Monastery compare to the other Monastery is that you get to exist in spaces where you get a very nice view of the mountain ranges in Lhasa. This monastery is very huge so bring water. Ones you see the inside of this monastery the rest of the monastery in",
          "It lies on the hill like a giant. Very rich in culture and history. It's lively but peaceful. The monastries spread out, so the visit takes at least 2 hours. Personally I think it's more worth visiting than Potala...",
          "small monestary, but it's very much \"in use\" and not as controlled by the Chinese. We saw chanting and praying and were the only tourists in the place (no big Chinese tour groups)",
          "It collected plenty of historical and cultural relics and Buddhism sculptures. The vivid and precious statues worshiped in the monastery reflected the advanced sculpture art in Tibet. The colorful murals and Thangka are also of great value.",

          "Really liked Drepung Monastry, as you really got the feel that it was being used for the intention it was built. The shows may seem a little staged, but still facinating, and the debating garden is a must - they are timed to coincide with the tours so you wont miss it!",
          "I was here In Shoton/Yoghurt Festival 2011(end of August). This moment, this place was very crowded, so many plgrims from all over Tibet area came here. The purpose was to pray when the big Budha image was shown, the image was only shown for about a half day only. The location",
          "Set on the hillside, away from the city this temple makes you feel like real Tibet. Everything is here, including taking photo's inside (for a fee). Old ruins of Chinese destruction surround the existing temple. Military is still everywhere, but at least with all the narrow",
          "We really loved going to Drepung Monastery. It's a little bit outside of the city and up on the mountain. It was so peaceful, it's exactly how we envisioned how Tibet would be. The monks prayed and lived peacefully on the grounds. They charge you to take pictures in certain",
          "Cannot be in Lhasa and not visit the Fepung Monastery. Beautiful and interesting. Make sure you have a really English speaking guide otherwise you will not get the historic background.",
          "Certainly worth a visit but beware, some monks here ATTACK tourists. Very rude monks, so walk tight and keep your eyes open.",
          "Large monastery with many different buildings currently quite well presented. Not slow to charge for photography so perhaps choose the best buildings for the camera.",
          "We might have enjoyed this monastery more than any place in Lhasa. It is huge, out of the way, and feels like the real pilgrimage site. Locals are everywhere, paying homage to shrines and keeping the candles burning by adding yak butter. We saw some amazing things here, like",
          "Seen from afar, its grand, white construction gives the monastery the appearance of a heap of rice. Hence the name \"Drepung Monastery\" which in Tibetan language means \"Monastery of Collecting Rice\". Lovely monastery once you walk up a rather steep incline past a multitude of",
          "The monastery itself - or what we saw of it - was nice, but not more beautiful than the Sera monastery we saw the day before. Main attraction - yes, attraction, with a lot of tourists - is the debating of the monks, which is nice, but the tourists kind of made it feel less",
          "Drepung is just outside Lhasa. We went with a guide using public transport. The monastery is set on a hill with views over the new part of Lhasa. Unlike some other temples and monasteries, it wasn't crowded with tourists and pilgrims. We met a Buddhist nun who lives in a cave",
          "Built in 1416, Drepung Monastery is the largest monastery in Tibet, and at its peak was the largest monastery in the world. Like the other monasteries in Lhasa, it is from the Gelug sect, which most Tibetans now belong to. What makes a visit to Drepung special, I think, is",
          "The temple part of the monastery is pretty much the same as all other temples you are likely to see in Lhasa. The thing that makes Drepung different is the debating of the monks. This happens in the afternoon after their meditation and is a bit of a spectacle. So make sure that"

It dates back to the seventh century and is considered to be the most important temple in the city after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwestern part of the Tibetan capital, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang. The site occupies an area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre).\n\n\n== History ==\nRamoche is considered to be the sister temple to the Jokhang which was completed about the same time. Tradition says that it was built originally to house the much revered Jowo Rinpoche statue, carried to Lhasa via Lhagang in a wooden cart, brought to Tibet when Princess Wencheng came to Lhasa. Unlike, the Jokhang, Ramoche was originally built in Chinese style. During Mangsong Mangtsen's reign (649-676), because of a threat that the Tang Chinese might invade, Princess Wencheng is said to have had the statue of Jowo Rinpoche hidden in a secret chamber in the Jokhang. Princess Jincheng, sometime after 710 CE, had it placed in the central chapel of the Jokhang. It was replaced at Ramoche by a statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a small bronze statue of the Buddha when he was eight years old, crafted by Vishvakarman, and brought to Lhasa by the Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti. It was badly damaged by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.The temple was badly damaged during the Mongol invasions and there is no certainty that the statue that remained in 1959 was the original one. The original temple was destroyed by fire, and the present three-storied building was constructed in 1474. Soon after it became the Assembly Hall of the Gyuto Tratsang, or Upper Tantric College of Lhasa and was home to 500 monks. There was a close connection with Yerpa which provided summer quarters for the monks.\n\n\n== Destruction and restoration ==\n\nThe temple was gutted by fire and destroyed in the 1959 Lhasa uprising against Chinese occupation and the bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. Thanks to the efforts of Ri \u2018bur sprul sku, the parts were joined in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, yet still showed damage in 1993.\nA major restoration was undertaken in 1986 and the temple now has three stories. Near the main entrance to the building are ten pillars displaying local relics and symbols such as lotus flowers, jewellery, coiling clouds and Tibetan characters. The first floor has an atrium off which opens a scripture hall and the winding corridors of a Buddha palace. The second floor is mainly residential but has a chapel with an image of Buddha as King of the Nagas, and the third floor provides sleeping quarters reserved for the use of the Dalai Lama.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDorje, Gyume (1999).

        "wiki": "Lhasa (simplified Chinese: \u62c9\u8428\u5e02; traditional Chinese: \u62c9\u85a9\u5e02; pinyin: L\u0101s\u00e0 Sh\u00ec) is a prefecture-level city, one of the main administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It covers an area of 29,274 square kilometres (11,303 sq mi) of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is Lhasa, with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District and Dagz\u00ea District. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the Lhasa River, a major tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. It lies on the Lhasa terrane, the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the Himalayas. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare snow leopard and black-necked crane. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway, which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Field. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is 277 kilometres (172 mi) from east to west and 202 kilometres (126 mi) from north to south. It covers an area of 29,518 square kilometres (11,397 sq mi).\nIt is bordered by Nagqu City to the north, Nyingchi City to the east, Shannan/Lhoka City to the south and Xigaz\u00ea City to the west.\nThe prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the Lhasa River, which is the center of Tibet politically, economically and culturally. Chengguan District is also the center of Tibet in terms of transport, communications, education and religion, as well as being the most developed part of Tibet and a major tourist destination with sights such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang and Ramoche Temple.\n\n\n=== Lhasa River basin ===\n\nLhasa prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the Lhasa River, a major tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Exceptions are the north of Damxung County, which crosses the watershed of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains and includes part of the Namtso lake, and Ny\u00eamo County, which covers the basin of the Nimu Maqu River, a direct tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo.\nThe river basin is separated from the Yarlung Tsangpo valley to the south by the Goikarla Rigyu range.\nThe largest tributary of the Lhasa River, the Reting Tsangpo, originates in the Chenthangula Mountains in Nagqu Prefecture at an elevation of about 5,500 metres (18,000 ft), and flows southwest into Lhasa past Reting Monastery.The Lhasa River drains an area of 32,471 square kilometres (12,537 sq mi), and is the largest tributary of the middle section of the Yarlung Tsangpo. \nThe average altitude of the basin is around 4,500 metres (14,800 ft).\nThe basin has complex geology and is tectonically active. Earthquakes are common.\nAnnual runoff is 10,550,000,000 cubic metres (3.73\u00d71011 cu ft). \nWater quality is good, with little discharge of sewage and minimal chemical pesticides and fertilizers.The Lhasa River forms where three smaller rivers converge.\nThese are the Phak Chu, the Phongdolha Chu which flows from Damxung County and the Reting Tsangpo, which rises beyond the Reting Monastery.\nThe highest tributary rises at around 5,290 metres (17,360 ft) on the southern slope of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains.\nIn its upper reaches the river flows southeast through a deep valley.\nLower down the river valley is flatter and changes its direction to the southwest, The river expands to a width of 150 to 200 metres (490 to 660 ft).\nMajor tributaries in the lower reaches include the Pengbo River and the Duilong River.\nAt its mouth the Lhasa Valley is about 3 miles (4.8 km) wide.The bulk of the water is supplied by the summer monsoon rains, which fall from July to September.\nThere are floods in the summer from July to September, with about 17% of the annual runoff flowing in September.\nIn winter the river has low water, and sometimes freezes. \nTotal flow is about 4 cubic kilometres (0.96 cu mi), with average flow about 125 cubic metres per second (4,400 cu ft/s).\nThe total hydropower potential of the river basin is 2,560,000 kW.Zhikong Hydro Power Station in Maizhokunggar County delivers 100 MW.\nThe Pangduo Hydro Power Station in Lh\u00fcnzhub County has total installed capacity of 160 MW.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe former Lhasa prefecture lies in the Lhasa terrane, to which it gives its name. This is thought to be the last crustal block to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the collision with the Indian plate in the Cenozoic.\nThe terrane is separated from the Himalayas to the south by the Yarlung-Tsangpo suture, and from the Qiangtang terrane to the north by the Bangong-Nujiang suture.\nThe Lhasa terrane consisted of two blocks before the Mesozoic, the North Lhasa Block and the South Lhasa Block.\nThese blocks were joined in the Late Paleozoic.\n\nThe Lhasa terrane moved northward and collided with the Qiangtang terrane along the Bangong suture.\nThe collision began towards the end of the late Jurassic (c.\u2009163\u2013145 Ma), and collision activity continued until the early Late Cretaceous (c.\u2009100\u201366 Ma). \nDuring this period the terrane may have been shortened by at least 180 kilometres (110 mi).\nThe collision caused a peripheral foreland basin to form in the north part of the Lhasa terrane. \nIn some parts of the foreland basin the north-dipping subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic crust below the Lhasa terrane caused volcanism. \nThe Gangdese batholith was formed as this subduction continued along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane.\nThe Gangdese intrudes the southern half of the Lhasa terrain.Contact with India began along the Yarlung-Zangbo suture around 50 Ma during the Eocene, and the two continents continue to converge. \nMagmatism continued in the Gangdese arc until as late as 40 Ma.\nThere was significant crustal shortening as the collision progressed.\nThe South Lhasa terrane experienced metamorphism and magmatism in the Early Cenozoic (55\u201345 Ma) and metamorphism in the Late Eocene (40\u201330 Ma), presumably due to the collision between the continents of India and Eurasia.Rocks in this region include sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic into which granite has intruded during the Cretaceous.\nThe rocks have metamorphosed and are deeply eroded and faulted.\nThe rocks exposed in the Reting Tsangpo canyon range in age from 400 Ma to 50 Ma.\nThe result of faulting has been to often juxtapose relatively recent rocks with much older rocks.\nSome parts of the ocean floor were pushed up onto the Tibetan Plateau and formed marble or slate.\nSea fossils from 400 Ma are found in the river's canyons, and houses are roofed with slate.The Yangbajing Basin lies between the Nyainquentanglha Range to the northwest and the Yarlu-Zangbo suture to the south.\nThe Yangbajain Geothermal Field is in the central part of a half-graben fault-depression basin caused by the foremontane fault zone of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains.\nThe SE-dipping detachment fault began to form about 8 Ma.\nThe geothermal reservoir is basically a Quaternary basin underlaid by a large granite batholith.\nThe basin has been filled with glacial deposits from the north and alluvial-pluvial sediments from the south.\nFluid flows horizontally into the reservoir through the faults around the basin.\nChemical analysis of the thermal fluid indicate that there is shallow-seated magmatic activity not far below the geothermal field.During the ice ages of the last two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the expanded polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nThe Lhasa valley is roughly the same latitude as the southern United States, but at an altitude of 3,610 metres (11,840 ft) or more it is of course cooler.\nThe central river valleys of Tibet are warm in summer, and even in the coldest months of winter the temperature is above freezing on sunny days.\nThe climate is semi-arid monsoon, with a low average temperature of 1.2 to 7.5 \u00b0C (34.2 to 45.5 \u00b0F). \nAverage annual precipitation is 466.3 millimetres (18.36 in), with 85% falling in the June\u2013September period.\nTypically there are 3,000 hours of sunshine each year.\nIt is cooler in the northern regions, warmer in the south. Annual figures:\n\nStudies of temperature and precipitation data from 1979 to 2005 indicate that higher temperatures are leading to longer snow-free periods at the lower elevations. \nHowever, at higher levels the amount of precipitation has increased, so despite warming the snow-free period is shorter.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nMost of the population of Tibet lives in the southern valleys, including those around Lhasa.\nThe higher regions are used by nomadic drokpa who tend herds of yaks, sheep and goats on the steppe grasslands of the hills and high valleys.\nIn the lower parts it is possible to cultivate products that include barley, wheat, black peas, beans, mustard, hemp, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, garlic, celery and tomatoes. The traditional staple food is barley flour called tsampa, often combined with buttered tea and made into a paste.A visitor described the valley around Lhasa in 1889 as follows,\n\nThe plain over which we are riding is a wonderfully fruitful one. It is skirted on the south by the Kyi river, and is watered, moreover, by another smaller stream from the north, which flows into the Kyi ... some five miles west of Lhasa. All this land is carefully irrigated by means of dikes and cross-channels from both rivers. Fields of buckwheat, barley, pea, rape, and lindseed lie in orderly series everywhere. The meadows near the water display the richest emerald-green pasturage. Groves of poplar and willow, in shapely clumps, combine with the grassy stretches to give in places a parklike appearance to the scene. Several hamlets and villages, such as Cheri, Daru, and Shing Dongkhar, are dotted over these lands. A fertile plain truly for a besieging army! \n\nThe Lhasa region does not have abundant wildlife or great numbers of species, but the Lhasa valley does support wintering populations of hundreds of black-necked cranes.Hutoushan Reservoir lies in Qangka Township, Lh\u00fcnzhub County.\nThe reservoir is bordered by large swamps and wet meadows, and has abundant plants and shellfish.\nThe reservoir, which lies in the Pengbo valley, is the largest in Tibet, with total storage of 12,000,000 cubic metres (420,000,000 cu ft).\nEndangered black-necked cranes migrate to the middle and southern part of Tibet every winter, and may be seen on the reservoir and elsewhere in the Lhasa region.\nOther wildlife includes bharal, pheasants, roe deer, Thorold's deer, Mongolian gazelle, Siberian ibex, otter, brown bear, snow leopard and duck.\nMedicinal plants include fritillaries (fritillaria), stonecrop (rhodiola), Indian barberry (berberis aristata), Chinese caterpillar fungus (ophiocordyceps sinensis), codonopsis and Lingzhi mushroom (ganoderma).The dams on the Lhasa river built as part of the Three Rivers Development Project are unlikely to affect the flow of the Brahmaputra in India.\nHowever, the climate and soil are unsuitable for large-scale irrigation.\nWhere grasslands have been converted into irrigated farms fed by dams the result may damage the environment.\nJama wetland in Maizhokunggar County is vulnerable to grazing and climate change.\nExtensive mining in some mountainous regions have turned areas of what was green pasturage into a grey wasteland. \nThe authorities are reported to have suppressed protests by the local people.\nMilitary personnel have been involved in efforts to protect and improve the environment, including replanting programs.A 2015 study reported that during the non-monsoon season the levels of arsenic in the Duilong River, at 205.6 \u03bcg/L were higher than the WHO guideline of 10 \u03bcg/L for drinking water.\nThe source of the pollution seems to be untreated water from the Yangbajain Geothermal Field power station.\nIt can be detected 90 kilometres (56 mi) downstream from this site.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nLhasa prefecture-level city consists of three districts and five counties. \nChengguan District, Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District, and Dagz\u00ea District contains most of the urban area of Lhasa, which lies in the Lhasa River valley floor.\n\n\n=== Chengguan District ===\n\nChengguan District is located on the middle reaches of the Lhasa River, with land that rises to the north and south of the river.\nIt is 28 kilometres (17 mi) from east to west and 31 kilometres (19 mi) from north to south.\nChengguan District is bordered by Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District to the west, Dagz\u00ea District to the east and Lh\u00fcnzhub County to the north. \nGonggar County of Lhoka (Shannan) City lies to the south.\nChengguan District has an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) and covers 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi).\nThe urban built-up area covers 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi). The average annual temperature is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F).\nAnnual precipitation is about 500 millimetres (20 in), mostly falling between July and September.Before the PRC takeover the city of Lhasa had a population of 25,000\u201330,000, or 45,000\u201350,000 if the large monasteries around the city are included.\nThe old city formed a quadrangle about 3 square kilometres (1.2 sq mi) around the Jokhang temple, about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the east of the Potala Palace.\nDuring the period before the reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping the old city of Lhasa was left largely intact, while bleakly functional compounds containing symmetrical dormitory-type buildings for both living and working were built apart from the city along the main roads.By 1990 the city had expanded to cover 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi), with an official population of 160,000.\nThe 2000 official census gave a total population of 223,001, of which 171,719 lived in the areas administered by sub-districts and residential committees. \n133,603 had urban registrations and 86,395 had rural registrations, based on their place of origin.\nBy 2013 the urban area  filled most of the natural Lhasa River valley in Chengguan District.\nA 2011 book estimated that up to two-thirds of the city's residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District as a whole is still 63% ethnic Tibetan.\n\n\n=== Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District ===\n\nDoilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District contains the western urban areas of Lhasa, developed in recent years with the new Lhasa railway station, which begin about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from the city center. \nIt covers an area of 2,704 square kilometers, with 94,969 acres of farmland.\nThe district borders on the north Tibet grasslands in the northwest. The valley of the Duilong River leads south to the Lhasa River. The Duilong is 95 kilometres (59 mi) in length.\nIn the south the district occupies part of the south bank of the Lhasa River.\nThe district has an average elevation of 4,000 metres (13,000 ft), with a highest elevation of 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) and a lowest point at 3,640 metres (11,940 ft).There are about 120 frost-free days annually.\nAnnual mean temperature is 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), with temperatures in January falling below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F)\nAnnual precipitation is about 440 millimetres (17 in), with autumn rainfall of 310 millimetres (12 in). \nThe district is agriculturally rich and was used by the Tibetan kings as a source of food for Lhasa.The seat of government is in the town of Donggar.\nThis is just 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) from downtown Lhasa.\nIn 1992 there were 33,581 people in 6,500 households, with 94.28% of the people engaged in farming. \nAbout 90% of the people were ethnic Tibetan, with most people of other ethnicity living in Donggar.\nThe main mineral resources are coal, iron, clay, lead and zinc.Tsurphu Monastery, built in 1189, is treated as a regional cultural relic reserve.\nThe Nechung Monastery, former home of the Nechung Oracle, is located in Naiquong township.\nNechung was built by the 5th Dalai Lama (1617\u201382).\n\n\n=== Dagz\u00ea District ===\nDagz\u00ea District has a total area of 1,373 square kilometres (530 sq mi) and it contains the eastern urban areas of Lhasa. It has an average elevation of 4,100 metres (13,500 ft) above sea level, and descends from higher ground in the north and south to 3,730 metres (12,240 ft) in the lowest part of the Lhasa River valley.\nThe average temperature is 7.5 \u00b0C (45.5 \u00b0F), with about 130 days free of frost.\nAverage rainfall is 450 millimetres (18 in).\nAbout 80%\u201390% of precipitation falls in the summer.As of 2013 the total population was 29,152.\nThe main occupation is agriculture.

As of 2011 there were 118 monks and 99 nuns.\nThe Ny\u00eamo Chekar monastery is known for its 16th century murals depicting reincarnations of the Samding Dorje Phagmo.\n\n\n=== Q\u00fcx\u00fc County ===\n\nQ\u00fcx\u00fc County has a total area of 1,680 square kilometres (650 sq mi), with an average elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft).\nThe county is in the Yarlung Tsangpo valley, and is mostly relatively flat, but rises to the Nyainq\u00eantanglha Mountains in the north.\nThe Lhasa River runs south through the eastern part of the county to its confluence with the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which forms the southern boundary of the county.\nThe lowest elevation is 3,500 metres (11,500 ft), and the highest summit elevation is 5,894 metres (19,337 ft).\nQ\u00fcx\u00fc County has about 150 days a year without frost.\nAnnual precipitation is 441.9 millimeters (17.40 in).Q\u00fcx\u00fc County has its headquarters in Q\u00fcx\u00fc Town.\nThe fifth census in 2000 recorded a population of 29,690.\nThe county seat has been growing fast, and had 5,000 people by 2002.\nChina National Highway 318 runs through Q\u00fcx\u00fc County from Lhasa towards the west. Bridges span the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River.Q\u00fcx\u00fc County is semi-agricultural and crops grown are mainly highland barley, winter wheat, spring wheat, peas and rapeseed. \nApples and walnuts are also produced.\nAnimal husbandry is also strong, with the main animals farmed including yak, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, pigs, and chickens.\nAs of 2002 the per capita net income of farmers and herdsmen was 1,960 yuan.\nThe Nyethang Drolma Lhakhang Temple is located in Q\u00fcx\u00fc County, said to have been founded in 1055 by Dromt\u00f6n, a pupil of Ati\u015ba.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe demographics of Lhasa prefecture-level city are difficult to define precisely due to the way in which administrative boundaries have been drawn, and the way in which statistics are collected.\nThe population of Lhasa prefectural-level city is about 500,000, of whom about 80% are ethnic Tibetan and most of the others are ethnic Han Chinese. Approximately 250,000 people live in the city and in towns, most of them in or near Chengguan District, and the remainder live in rural areas.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\n\nThe 2000 census give the following breakdown for the population of the prefecture-level city as a whole:\nThe 2000 census counts more than 105,000 people in Chengguan District who are registered elsewhere. \nMost of them are Han, with agricultural registrations.\nOutside Chengguan District, in 2000 the rural townships almost all had Han populations below 2.85%, other than one in Duilongdeqing County and one in Qushui County, both near the metropolitan district of Lhasa. Urban towns other than Yangbajain had Han populations of between 2.86% and 11.25%. Within the metropolitan district Han population ranged from 11.26% to 11.25% in the southern rural township to 46.56% to 47.46% in the city street offices.\nHan migrants accounted for 20% of the population, but held a much higher percentage of the higher-status office and service-sector jobs. \nHans also dominated construction, mining and trade.\n\nAccording to the November 2000 census, the ethnic distribution in Lhasa Prefecture-level City was as follows:\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nLhasa metropolitan district includes most of the built-up area, which counts as urban, and four rural townships. \nThe counties also contain urban towns, of which there are nine in the prefectural municipality.Official census figures for 2000 are:\nThe census figures differ considerably from the Tibet Statistical Yearbooks for the same period, since the yearbook only includes the registered population and counts them based on place of origin rather than place of residence. The 1990 census used an approach similar to the yearbook, so the numbers are misleading, but the 2000 census tried to count people who had actually been present in Lhasa for over six months. The census distinguishes between \"agricultural\" and \"non-agricultural\" registration, but this does not reflect the actual occupations of the people. Many with an \"agricultural\" registration may in fact work in the city or in a town.\nAlso, the census was taken in November, when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet. \nFinally, the census does not count the military.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nChina National Highway 318 enters the prefecture-level city from the east at Mila Mountain, where it reaches an elevation of 5,000 metres (16,404 ft).\nThe highway runs through Maizhokunggar County from east to west.\nIt continues along the south bank of the Lhasa River through Dagz\u00ea County, then crosses to the north of the river in Chengguan District and runs through the center of the urban district. It turns south to cross Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District, where it is joined by 109, and continues down the west side of the Lhasa River through Q\u00fcx\u00fc County, and then along the north shore of the Yarlung Tsangpo through Ny\u00eamo County, and onward to the west.\n\nChina National Highway 109 (the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Highway) runs through Damxung County from the northeast to southwest, then turns to the southeast at Yangbajain.\nIt then runs through Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District along the Duilong River valley, to join China National Highway 318 just west of Lhasa.\nThe Lhasa Airport Expressway from Lhasa to Lhasa Gonggar Airport in Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture is the first expressway in the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nConstruction began in April, 2009. The expressway is 37.8 kilometres (23.5 mi) long and has four lanes.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nThe Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway runs through the Lhasa prefecture-level city beside the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Highway through Damxung County and Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District.\nIt terminates at Lhasa railway station in Niu New Area (Liuwu Township).\nThe terminus of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet line, this station is over 3,600 metres (11,800 ft) above sea level, and is its largest passenger transport station.\nIt includes a clinic with oxygen treatment facilities. The station uses solar energy for heating.\nThe Liuwu Bridge links central Lhasa to Lhasa railway station and the newly developed Niu New Area of Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District on the south bank of the Lhasa River.\nResidents in the area were resettled to make way for the new development.\n\n\n=== Power ===\n\nThe Yangbajain Geothermal Station was established in 1977 to exploit the Yangbajain Geothermal Field in Damxung.\nIt is the first geothermal power station to be built in Tibet and is the largest geothermal steam power plant in China.\n4,000 kW of electricity from Yangbajain began to be delivered to Lhasa in 1981 along a transmission line that followed the Doilung Qu River.\nIt was the main power supply for Lhasa until the Yamdrok Hydropower Station came into operation.\nBy the end of 2000 eight steam turbo generators had been installed at the Yangbajain Geothermal Station, each with capacity of 3,000 kW, giving a total of 25,000 kW.\nThe geothermal field delivers 25,181 kilowatts, or 100 million kilowatts annually, to the city of Lhasa to the south.The Pangduo Hydro Power Station has been called \"Tibet's Three Gorges Dam\".\nIt impounds the Lhasa River in Pondo Township of Lh\u00fcnzhub County, about 63 kilometres (39 mi) from Lhasa.\nIt is at an elevation of 13,390 feet (4,080 m) above sea level, upstream from the 100MW Zhikong Dam at 12,660 feet (3,860 m).\nThe rock-fill dam impounds 1,170,000,000 cubic metres (4.1\u00d71010 cu ft) of water.\nThe power station has total installed capacity of 160 MW.The Zhikong Hydro Power Station lies between the middle and lower reaches of the Lhasa River, also called the Kyi River.\nIt is about 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Lhasa, in Maizhokunggar County.\nIt is at an elevation of 12,660 feet (3,860 m) above sea level, downstream from the Pangduo Hydro Power Station.\nThe Zhikong Dam, a rock-fill dam, is 50 metres (160 ft) tall.\nIt impounds 225,000,000 cubic metres (7.9\u00d7109 cu ft) of water.\nInstalled capacity is 100 MW.\n\n\n=== Other facilities ===\n\nThe rural counties generally have numerous primary schools at the village level, with high levels of attendance, and at least one secondary school. \nIn 2010 there were 28 schools in Dagz\u00ea County, including one junior high school and one kindergarten.\nAs of 2009 there were 37 primary and secondary school buildings in Damxung County.\nMaizhokunggar County has one high school, 14 full primary schools and 74 village schools.\nNy\u00eamo County has 24 primary and secondary schools, including one junior high school.\nAs of 2002 Q\u00fcx\u00fc County had one County Middle School, and 18 primary schools.\nOutside Lhasa most of the Tibetans do not understand the Chinese language, so Tibetan is the natural language for basic instruction. However, this may be affected by the availability of teachers and the preference of the local administration.\nAs of 2003 the former bilingual mode of instruction had been changed to giving instruction in Chinese in some of the counties near Lhasa. \nExamination results were already poor in subjects such as mathematics and physics. Marks dropped further after the change.Some of the township seats have a small clinic. Most have only a health station. \nThere were seven hospitals in Damxung in 2009, including a county hospital, with a total of 40 beds.\nThe first drug rehabilitation center in Tibet was being constructed in Duilongdeqing County in 2009. It was planned to provide physiological rehabilitation, psychological therapy and job training for up to 150 drug addicts.\nLh\u00fcnzhub County has 23 health care establishments, including a County People's Hospital with 30 beds.\nMaizhokunggar has been selected as a Cooperative Medical System experimental site, which has resulted in a very high percentage of people with health care coverage.\nNy\u00eamo County has a county hospital with 42 medical staff, eight rural health centers and 26 village clinics.The local television stations are Xizang TV (XZTV) and Lhasa Broadcasting and Television Center.\nLh\u00fcnzhub County has a local radio and television station. TV coverage is received by 72.1% of the population, and radio by 83.4% of the population.\nIn Maizhokunggar County television is available to 36% of the population and radio to 48%.\nThere is a county television station in Ny\u00eamo County.\nAs of 2002 in Q\u00fcx\u00fc County 98% of the population received radio coverage and 94% received television.\nIn 2015 there were 359,000 fixed line telephone subscribers in the whole of Tibet.\nThe rugged high-altitude terrain makes it expensive to provide telecommunications services.\nThe first mobile phone service was launched in 1993 with just one base station in Lhasa, and as late as 2005 mobile phones were expensive status symbols. Since then both mobile phones and internet usage have grown fast.As of 1996 the sole prison (jianyu) for judicially-sentenced political prisoners in Tibet was TAR Prison No. 1, also called Drapchi Prison after the neighborhood in Lhasa where it stands. It is for men serving sentences of five or more years. There is a labor camp (laogai) in Lhasa for men serving shorter sentences.\nThere are various other institutions where prisoners from Lhasa shi are held while they are being investigated, or where they undergo reform-through-labor.\n\n\n== Temples and monasteries ==\n\nBuddhism was adopted as the official religion of Tibet by king Songts\u00e4n Gampo (died 649) at a time when the rise of Hinduism was sweeping away Buddhism in India, the land of its birth. Over the next two centuries Buddhism became established in Tibet, now the center of the religion.Tibetan Buddhism would become a pervasive influence on the lives of the people.\nThe first monastery, Samy\u00e9, was founded by Trisong Detsen (c.\u2009740\u2013798).\nIts buildings were arranged in a mandala pattern after the Odantapuri monastery in Bihar. The three-story monastery was completed in 766 and consecrated in 767. \nSeven Tibetans took monastic vows in a ceremony that marked the start of the long Tibetan tradition of monastic Buddhism.\n\n\n=== Early foundations ===\nYerpa, on a hillside in Dagze County, is known for its meditation cave connected with Songts\u00e4n Gampo.\nThe cliffs contain some of the earliest known meditation sites in Tibet, some dating back to pre-Buddhist times. There are a number of small temples, shrines and hermitages. \nSongts\u00e4n Gampo's queen, Monza Triucham, founded the Dra Yerpa temple here.Jokhang in Chengguan District is the most sacred temple in Tibet, built in the 7th century when Songts\u00e4n Gampo transferred his capital to Lhasa.\nIt was designed to house an image of Buddha that the Nepalese queen Tritsun had brought. Later rulers and Dalai Lamas enlarged and elaborated the temple.Ramoche Temple to the north of Jokhang is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after Jokhang, and was completed about the same time.Muru Nyingba Monastery is a small monastery located between the larger Jokhang temple and Barkhor in the city of Lhasa. \nIt was the Lhasa seat of the former State Oracle who had his main residence at Nechung Monastery.\nIt was destroyed during the persecution of Buddhism under Langdarma (c.\u2009838\u2013841) but rebuilt by Ati\u015ba (980\u20131054).\nThe monastery was part of the Sakya sect at one time. but became Gelug under Sonam Gyatso, the 3rd Dalai Lama (1543\u201389).\n\n\n=== Middle period ===\n\nThe Nyethang Drolma Temple is southwest of Lhasa, 36 kilometres (22 mi) from the county seat and 33 kilometres (21 mi) from Lhasa. \nIt is in Ny\u00e9tang, Q\u00fcx\u00fc County.\nSome sources say that Ati\u015ba (980\u20131054) built the monastery, which was expanded after his death by his pupil Dromt\u00f6n (1004\u201364). \nAnother version says that Dromt\u00f6n raised funds to build the temple to commemorate his old friend.\nDromt\u00f6n built Reting Monastery in  Lh\u00fcnzhub County in 1056.\nIt was the earliest monastery of the Gedain sect, and the patriarchal seat of that sect.\nIn 1240 a Mongol force sacked Reting monastery and killed 500 people. The gompa was rebuilt.\nWhen the Gedain sect joined the Gelug sect in the 16th century the monastery adopted the reincarnation system.Tsurphu Monastery in Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District was built in 1189 and is treated as a regional cultural relic reserve.\nThe monastery was founded by D\u00fcsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama, founder of Karma Kagyu school.\nIt is the main Kagyu temple.\nThe Drigung Monastery of the Kagyu Sect was founded in 1179 in Maizhokunggar County.\nIt is the home of the Drikhung Kagyu School of the Kagyu sect.\nAt one time Drigung was highly influential in both the political and religious spheres. \nIt was destroyed in 1290 by Mongols led by a general from the rival Sakya sect, and although rebuilt was never able to regain its power.Yangpachen Monastery in Yangbajain, Damxung County was historically the seat of the Shamarpas of Karma Kagyu.\nIt is the main monastery of the Red Hat school of the Karma Kagyu sect. It was built in 1490, and through extensive repairs and additions grew into a major architectural complex that contained a large collection of cultural relics. The Red Hat school of Karma Kagyu died out in 1791.\nOther monasteries founded outside the Gelug tradition include Taklung Monastery of the Kagyu school, founded in 1180 in Lh\u00fcnzhub County, and Ny\u00eamo Chekar monastery of the Bodongpa school, founded in the 16th century in Ny\u00eamo County.\n\n\n=== Gelug foundations ===\n\nGanden Monastery was built after 1409 at the initiative of Je Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelug sect, and is the most important of this sect. It is 57 kilometres (35 mi) from Lhasa on the slopes of Wangbori Mountain at an elevation of 3,800 metres (12,500 ft), on the south bank of the Lhasa River in Dagze County. The mountain is said to have the shape of a reclining elephant.\nThe monastery includes Buddha halls, palace residences, Buddhist colleges and other buildings.Drepung Monastery in Chengguan District was founded in 1416 by Jamyang Choge Tashi Palden (1397\u20131449), one of Tsongkhapa's main disciples.\nIt was named after the sacred abode in South India of Shridhanyakataka.\nAt one time Drepung Monastery, with up to 10,000 resident monks, was the largest in the world. Sera Monastery was not much smaller.\nSera Monastery, about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Lhasa, was founded in 1419 by Jamchen Ch\u00f6j\u00e9 Shakya Yesh\u00e9 (1354\u20131435), a close disciple of Tsongkhapa.\nGanden, Drepung and Sera are called the great \"Three Seats of Learning\" of the Gulugpa school.The Nechung Monastery, former home of the Nechung Oracle, is located in Naiquong township, also in Duilongdeqing County. Nechung was built by the 5th Dalai Lama (1617\u201382). Other Gelug foundations include Sanga Monastery (1419, Dagz\u00ea County), Ani Tsankhung Nunnery (15th century, Chengguan District), Kundeling Monastery (1663, Chengguan District), and Tsomon Ling (17th century, Chengguan District).\n\n\n=== Revolution and reconstruction ===\n\nMost of the monasteries in the prefecture-level city suffered damage, and many were destroyed, before and during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376).\nJokhang was used as a military barracks and a slaughterhouse during the Cultural Revolution, and then as a hotel for Chinese officials.\nMany of the statues were taken, or were damaged or destroyed, so most of the present statues are recent copies.\nJokhang was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.\nRamoche Temple was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution but has been restored with assistance from the Swiss.\nThe Nyethang Drolma Temple survived the Cultural Revolution without much damage, and was able to preserve most of its valuable artifacts, due to the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai at the request of the government of what is now Bangladesh.Reting Monastery was devastated by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, and has only been partially restored.\nTsurphu monastery was reduced to rubble, but the huge temples and chanting halls have been rebuilt.\nBefore and during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376) Drigung Monastery was looted of almost all its collection of statues, stupas, thangkas, manuscripts and other objects apart from a few small statues that the monks managed to hide. The buildings were severely damaged.\nReconstruction began in 1983 and seven of the fifteen temples were rebuilt.\nYangpachen Monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but later was rebuilt.Ganden Monastery was completely destroyed during the rebellion of 1959. \nIn 1966 it was severely shelled by Red Guard artillery, and monks had to dismantle the remains. \nThe buildings were reduced to rubble using dynamite during the Cultural Revolution.\nRe-building has continued since the 1980s.\nNechung was almost completely destroyed but has been largely restored.\nThere is a huge new statue of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) on the second floor.Nine sites in the Lhasa valley were listed in 1985 by the TAR Cultural Relics Authority as \"regionally protected buildings\". \nThese were Tsangkung Nunnery, Meru Monastery and Great Kashmiri Mosque in the old city, and the Karmashar Temple, Meru Nyingba Monastery and Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western Rigsum Temples elsewhere in the former prefecture.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Lhasa (prefecture-level city) at Wikimedia Commons",

          "You can see the top of the mosque from over the walls and the Muslim neighborhood it's in has many interesting little shops and groceries but you can't get in unless you're Muslim (at least, they wouldn't let us in).",
          "Well worth a walk round, the Mosque is the centre of a fascinating enclave of mostly Muslim run shops and restaurants, offering great food. This also shows how well Buddhism and Islam can coexist in close proximity.",
          "I was passing by and saw that the door was open, so I popped in. The place was quiet. The building looks quite modern. out front of the mosque is a busy market area with lots of stall to choose from.",
          "Nice enough Mosque and a lot of interesting things to learn but not a must. Relationship between the cats and people of the mosque was lovely. Lovely to see. The man told the cat to sit and it did just that. If you have some spare time take a look but don't come out of your way",
          "This was actually one of my favorite spots in Lhasa because of the food experience there. Overall, our restaurants experience in Lhasa was a disappointment, but this little neighborhood saved out trip. It's a ten minute walk from Barkhor street and five minutes from St Regis",
          "A short (10 mnute)walk from either the eastern end of Jokhang Temple or the corner of Lingkor and Jiansu East roads in the Muslim area of the old town. Is the green domed mosque, if you are Muslim its worth a stop. By far the best part about a visit to this area are the people",
          "You cannot go inside unless you are Muslim which is a shame. Unless you are walking by there isn't any reason to visit here.",
          "We could walk in through the gates, but you cannot go into the Mosque unless you are Muslim. It looked impressive from the outside, but our view was quite obstructed. It is interesting to look at the Muslim shops on the adjacent street - the caterpillars are quite expensive."

        "wiki": "Yerpa (also known as Brag Yer-pa, Drak Yerpa, Druk Yerpa, Dagyeba, Dayerpa and Trayerpa) is only a short drive to the east of Lhasa, Tibet, and consists of a monastery and a number of ancient meditation caves that used to house about 300 monks.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDra Yerpa is located on a hillside in Dagz\u00ea County. The entrance to the Yerpa Valley is about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) northeast of Lhasa on the northern bank of the Kyichu. From there, it is another 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the famous ancient meditation caves in the spectacular limestone cliffs of the Yerpa Valley (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0fb2\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f61\u0f7a\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f0b, Wylie: Brag Yer-pa). There is an ancient sky burial site opposite the main caves.\nThe famous legendary hero Gesar of Ling is said to have visited the valley. The holes his arrows left in the cliffs are believed to be evidence of his presence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThere are a number of small temples shrines and hermitages and the cliffs contain some of the earliest known meditation sites in Tibet, some dating back to pre-Buddhist times. Among the more famous are those traditionally connected with Songtsen Gampo (604\u2013650 CE), (traditionally the 33rd king of the Yarlung Dynasty and first emperor of a united Tibet). His Tibetan queen, Monza Triucham, founded the Dra Yerpa temple here.He and his two foreign-born queens are said to have meditated in the 'Peu Marsergyi Temple' and in the 'Chogyel Puk', and to have discovered 'self-originated' symbols of the Buddha-body, speech and mind. Padmasambhava, or Guru Rinpoche (late 8th to early 9th century), meditated and practiced tantric yoga with his yogini Yeshe Tsogyal here, and to have spent 7 months in meditation in the 'Dawa Puk', which is considered to be one of his three most important places of attainment.\nAfter Lhalung Pelgyi Dorje assassinated the anti-Buddhist Bon Emperor Langdarma in 842 CE he is said to have hidden himself in a cave and meditated for 22 years.\nHis hat was kept there until 1959.Yerpa became one of the three most important centres of meditation and retreat in Central Tibet. Several of Guru Rinpoche's disciples are also said to have meditated here. Atisha (982 \u2013 1054 CE) preached extensively in the valley. \nAtisha's hermitage is in ruins but had 300 monks in the 19th century and was the summer quarters for the Ramoche Monastery (the Upper Tantric College).Later histories record that both Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Detsen (756\u2013797) founded temples at Yerpa, and Klu-mes Tshul-khrims did some refurbishing in the 11th century.\nTradition says that after Songtsen Gampo's only son, Gungri Gungsten, was born to Mangza Tricham, Princess of Mang, one of his wives: \"A shrine and a stupa dedicated to the tutelary deity of mother and son were built upon the lap of a rocky mountain that resembled a seated image of the Holy Tara in the region of Yerpa.\"\n\n\n=== Gelug control ===\nThe ancient Kadampa gompa Yerpa Drubde passed to Gelug control after the reformation of Je Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419). \nAfter the death of the 4th Dalai Lama (1589\u20131617), in 1618 the monks of the Gelug monasteries of Sera and Drepung revolted against the Tsangpa forces in Lhasa. Those who were not killed took refuge in Taglung, to the northeast. \nKh\u00f6nt\u00f6n Rinpoch\u00e9, who had tried to persuade the monks of Sera to avoid violence, moved to Yerpa until calm returned.\nYerpa lost its wealth at this time, and was placed under the jurisdiction of Taklung Monastery.\n\n\n=== Recent years ===\nThere were some 300 monks living at Yerpa from at least the beginning of the 19th century until 1959. \nIt also acted as summer residence for the Gyuto Lhasa Tantric College.\nThe Drubde monastery, the summer residence of the Gyut\u00f6 College, was destroyed in 1959.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376) the whole complex at Yerpa, including the Drag Yerpa monastery and the Upper Tantric College summer residence, were completely destroyed.Using voluntary labor and donations some of the cave temples and Drag Yerpa were later partially restored.\nPolice came to Yerpa after the disturbances of October 1987 and pasted notices on the temple doors warning people against taking part in \"counter-revolutionary activities\".\nIn 1998 the government demolished a number of chapels that had been built without authorization.\nThe number of monks allowed at Yerpa was still strictly controlled in 2008.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Pabonka Hermitage (Pha bong kha), also written Pawangka, is a historical hermitage, today belonging to Sera Monastery, about 8 kilometres northwest of Lhasa in the Nyang bran Valley on the slopes of Mount Parasol (Dbu gdugs ri) in Tibet.\nFounded by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century, it is currently the largest and most important of the Sera hermitages and is the starting point for the \u201cSixth-Month Fourth-Day\u201d (Drug pa tshe bzhi) of the Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit (Se ra\u2019i ri \u2019khor) pilgrimage.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site, which is over 1,300 years old, dates back to Songtsen Gampo, the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and was amongst the first buildings built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement. Although originally the site of his castle or fort, the Tibetan Annals have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery, possibly under the reign of the second great Buddhist king of Tibet Trisong Detsen. Detsen, along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new Tibetan Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet's very earliest Buddhist monasteries, possibly even pre-dating Jokhang.\nThe original nine-storied monastery was partially destroyed by King Langdharma in 841 during his campaign to destroy monastic Buddhism; it was rebuilt in the 11th century as a two-storied structure that housed 200 monks. \n\nJe Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419) lived at the site as a hermit, and it eventually became a scholarly institution. The Fifth Dalai Lama was known to be fond of the monastery and funded the building of an upper floor for Pabonka.Before 1959, Pabonka was independent of Sera Monastery, and from 1960 to the mid-1980s it was controlled by the Chinese. It then came under the control of Sera, whose monks renovated it and are continuing its traditions.\n\n\n== Monastic structure ==\n\n\n=== Rigsum Gonpo Temple ===\n\nThis temple is noted for its many shrines, and its blue and carved gold mantra in the hallway, inscribed with words meaning, \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\".  A number of stone relics were buried during the Cultural Revolution but when Sera monks restored the hermitage  they excavated the relics and restored most of them.  A central shrine, dating back 1300 years to Gampo, is located in the temple and depicts Chenresig, Jampelyang and Chana Dorje, the so-called \"Rigsum Gompo Trinity\" from which the temple takes its name.\n\n\n=== Pabonka Potrang ===\n\nThe upper floor of the Pabonka Potrang building, perched on a pile of rocks, has a notable assembly hall on the second floor and contains a photograph of the current abbot and a chenresig statue hidden on the right behind a pillar. The interior chapel contains an ancient conch shell (dungkhar) wrapped in a prayer scarf (kathak) displayed in a glass case. In the adjacent room is a four-pillared Kashima Lhakhang with statues of three kings and their wives and various eminent lamas. The rooftop quarters, intended for the Dalai Lama on his visits, contains a statue of the deity Demchok and offers panoramic views of the hillside towards Lhasa.\n\n\n=== Palden Lhamo Cave ===\n\nUp the hill from the hermitage, past a group of chortens, is Palden Lhamo Cave, a cave known to have been a meditation chamber of Songstan Gampo himself. Inside the cave are statues of Songtsen Gampo and his two wives. It also has a rock carving of Palden Lhamo, the protectress.\n\n\n=== Jasa Potrang ===\n\nLocated near 108 chortens (stupas), which are a prominent feature of the monastery, is the ochre yellow brick building of Jasa Potrang, which is dedicated to Songtsen Gampo's wife, Princess Wencheng. On the upper floor of the building is a chapel with a small statue of her on the right and a depiction of Tibetan philologist Thonmi Sambhota who is believed to have invented the Tibetan alphabet at the hermitage, who is also recognised in the Valley of the Kings. Gampo's other wife, Bhrikuti, is called \"honored\". On the ground floor are the five manifestations of Tsongkhapa, and various Buddha statues with medical themes.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\nThe hermitage notably has its own tradition of monthly and yearly ritual cycles. The most important of these yearly ritual events (at least for the laity) are the six-day (three sets of two-day) Avalokite\u015bvara fasting rituals that take place during the Tibetan New Year (Losar) celebrations, the sixteen-day (eight sets of two-day) Avalokite\u015bvara fasting rituals that take place during the fourth Tibetan month (they attract many people from Lhasa and the surrounding districts), and a ritual and other events that take place during the \u201cSixth-Month Fourth-Day\u201d pilgrimage.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGyurme Dorje.

It is medium-sized temple which used to house about a hundred monks.\n\n\n== History and functions ==\nIt was the seat of State Oracle until 1959 when he fled with the Dalai Lama to India who now lives in exile in Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lamas traditionally always consulted him before making an important decision.It was the residence of the Protector Pehar, a deity of the Horpas, who lived to the east of (Lake) Kokonor. According to tradition, he is held to have been originally brought to Samye Monastery by Padmasambhava who bound him to protect the dharma. An alternative story is that he was brought back by a Bon general, Tara Lugong, who took possession of the meditation school near Kanchow of the Bha\u0163a Hor, a tribe of Uighurs, about the end of the 8th century CE. Pehar was regarded as the guardian deity of the treasures of Samye Monastery and, later, as the 'protector of religion'.\n\nDuring the time of Lobsang Gyatso, the Fifth Dalai Lama (r. 1642-1682), Pehar was first moved from Samye to Tse Gugtang and then to the present site of Nechung Monastery.Although the State Oracle is a Nyingma monk, he has been adopted by the Gelugpas  and is now chosen for his receptivity to possession by Pehar during trance. He is considered to be the medium of Dorje Drakden, one of Pehar's aspects.When the State Oracle is possessed by Pehar, he becomes very agitated, with tongue lolling, bloodshot eyes and displays superhuman strength, lifting heavy weights, twisting swords, etc. He mumbles words which are recorded and then interpreted by monks and also blesses grain which is thrown to the crowd.\n\nUnlike most Central Asian shamans, who are thought to leave their bodies when in a trance-like state and travel to the land of the spirits from where they bring back messages, Tibetan oracles act \"as a mouthpiece for the gods or spirits who possess him and speak through him, very often without his own knowledge of what is being said, answering directly the questions of those who consult him.\" The tradition of oracles was inherited from the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet, B\u00f6n. The \"great\" Fifth Dalai Lama was \"the first to institutionalise the State Oracle of N\u00e4chung.\"Nechung was almost completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and annexation of Tibet by China, though now, it has been largely restored and there is a huge new statue of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) on the second floor. There is a college of debate to the east of Nechung which is once again attended by young students.\nA new Nechung Monastery has been built in Dharamsala, India.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nChapman, F.

        "wiki": "Ganden Monastery (also Gaden or Gandain) or Ganden Namgyeling is one of the \"great three\" Gelug university monasteries of Tibet. It is in Dagz\u00ea County, Lhasa. The other two are Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery. Ganden Monastery was founded in 1409 by Je Tsongkhapa Lozang-dragpa, founder of the Gelug order. The monastery was destroyed after 1959, but has since been partially rebuilt. Another monastery with the same name and tradition was established in Southern India in 1966 by Tibetan exiles.\n\n\n== Location ==\nGanden is 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of Lhasa.\nThe monastery lies in a hilly natural amphitheater. from the kora route around the monastery there are dramatic views over the valleys that surround it.\nGanden Monastery is at the top of Wangbur Mountain, Dagz\u00ea County at an altitude of 4,300m.\nIts full name is Ganden Namgyal Ling (dga' ldan rmam rgyal gling). Ganden means \"joyful\" and is the Tibetan name for Tu\u1e63ita, the heaven where the bodhisattva Maitreya is said to reside. Namgyal Ling means \"victorious temple\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGanden Monastery was founded by Je Tsongkhapa Lozang-dragpa (1357\u20131419) in 1409.\nTsongkhapa built Ganden's main temple, with large statues and three-dimensional mandalas.\nHe often stayed at Ganden, and died there in 1419.\nTsongkhapa's preserved body was entombed at Ganden by his disciples in a silver and gold encrusted tomb.The name \"Gelug\" is an abbreviation of \"Ganden Lug\", meaning \"Ganden Tradition\".\nThe Ganden Tripa or \"throne-holder of Ganden\" is the head of the Gelug school.\nBefore dying Tsongkhapa gave his robe and staff to the first Ganden Tripa, Gyeltsabjey (1364-1432), who was succeeded by Kaydrubjey.\nThe term of office is seven years, and by 2003 there had been 99 Ganden Tripas.\nThe monastery was divided into four colleges at the time of the 2nd Ganden Tripa. \nLater these were consolidated in two, Jangtsey and Shartsey, located respectively to the north and east of the main temple.\nBoth combine the study of sutra and tantra.\nStudy methods include memorization, logic and debate. The colleges grant degrees for different levels of achievement, evaluated by examination and formal public debate.\n\nIn the 1860s a meeting called \"the great Ganden Monastery, Drepung Monastery, and the government officials\" was organized by Shatra, a lay aristocrat. The existing regent was deposed by this assembly and replaced by Shatra.\nFrom then on the assembly, or Tsondu, chose the regents and played a significant political role as a consultative body.\nThe monasteries of Ganden, Sera and Drepung was so great that they could in effect veto government decisions with which they disagreed.\nThese three monasteries had 20,000 monks in total, supported by large estates of fertile land worked by serfs.\nAt one time the Ganden monastery could support over 5,000 monks.Laurence Waddell reports an estimate of about 3,300 in the 1890s.\nThere were apparently only 2,000 monks in 1959.Ganden Monastery was completely destroyed by the People's Liberation Army during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In 1966 it was severely shelled by Red Guard artillery, and monks had to dismantle the remains. \nThe buildings were reduced to rubble using dynamite during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376).\nMost of Tsongkhapa's mummified body was burned, but his skull and some ashes were saved from the fire by Bomi Rinpoche, the monk who had been forced to carry the body to the fire.Re-building has continued since the 1980s.\nEarly in 1996, after a ban had been imposed on pictures of the Dalai Lama, 400 monks at Ganden rioted.\nThey were fired upon by PLA troops, apparently causing two deaths and several injuries, followed by the arrest of one hundred monks. \nAs of 2012 there were about 400 monks, and rapid progress was being made on rebuilding the monastery.\nThe red-painted lhakang in the centre is the reconstruction of Ganden's sanctum sanctorum containing Tsongkapa's reliquary chorten called the Tongwa Donden, \"Meaningful to Behold.\"\n\n\n== Structures ==\nGanden contained more than two dozen major chapels with large Buddha statues. The largest chapel was capable of seating 3,500 monks. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama (born 1935), took his final degree examination in Ganden in 1958 and he claims to feel a particularly close connection with Tsongkhapa.\nThe monastery runs a guesthouse for visitors.\nGanden's main assembly hall is a white building with gold-capped roofs, near a huge square.\nThe main chapel contains many gilded images of Tsongkhapa. A maroon and ochre chapel beside the main assembly hall has a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, and has a section used for hand-printing scriptural texts using wood blocks.The three main sights in the Ganden Monastery are the Serdung, which contains the tomb of Tsongkhapa, the Tsokchen Assembly Hall and the Ngam Cho Khang the chapel where Tsongkhapa traditionally taught. The monastery houses artifacts that belonged to Tsongkhapa.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Establishment in India ==\nThe Ganden Monastery has been re-established in Karnataka, India by the Tibetan population in exile. The Ganden Monastery is in the Tibetan settlement at Mundgod. This settlement of Tibetan refugees is the largest of its kind in India and was first established in 1966, from land donated by the Indian government.   \nIn the Tibetan settlement near Mundgod are the Ganden and the Drepung Monastery. In 1999 there were about 13,000 residents. The Tibetan settlement consists of nine camps with two monasteries and one nunnery. They established a credit bank for farms, an agricultural institute and a craft center. Modern technology and communication technology are being introduced. The curriculum of the Ganden Monastery remains similar to the teachings of the pre-1959 Ganden Monastery.\nThe Ganden Monastery Colleges Jangtse and Shartse have also been reestablished in India. They are named The Ganden Jangtse College and The Gaden Shartse Monastery. They are located in Karnataka.In 2008, over 500 monks, who refused to adhere to the ban against the protective deity Dorje Shugden, enforced by the Dalai Lama's government in exile, were expelled from the Ganden Monastery in Mundgod, Karnataka, and founded in its immediate neighborhood the Shar Gaden Monastery, officially opened in October 2009. As a result, the Dokhang Khangtsen, the biggest division of Gaden Shartse Monastery, where most of the departing monks came from, ceased to exist.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGanden Phodrang\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "wiki": "Lalu Wetlands National Nature Reserve, also known as Lhasa Wetlands Nature Preserve, protects 625 hectares (1,540 acres) of wetlands in the center of Lhasa City, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the southwestern People\u2019s Republic of China. The wetlands are completely surrounded by Lhasa, and constitute the largest urban park in the world and the largest urban wetlands in the world.\nThe preserve, initially created in 1994 as an urban park by the mayor of Lhasa with the support of his council, was subsequently made into a regional level preserve by the People\u2019s Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1999, and then elevated to national protection status on July 25, 2005. This preserve is also recognized as being of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on wetlands.\n\n\n== Physical aspects ==\nAt an elevation of 3,646 meters (11,962 feet) above sea level and protecting an area of 625 hectares (1,540 acres), these wetlands are typical of wetlands across the Tibetan Plateau, formed by impoundments of water into which first reeds (Phragmites sp.) grow then, as biomass builds up in the water with the advent of sedges, duckweed, (forming over time peat) also starts growing grasses and flowers such as Pedicularis sp. and gentians.These wetlands are immediately north of the Potala Palace. They are bounded by the Gangdese Mountains to the east and the Lhasa River (Kyi Chu) to the west.\n\n\n== Biological importance ==\nThe extensive wet area, with the river adjacent, has served as an excellent habitat for local and migratory waterfowl. These include the ruddy shelduck, bar-headed goose, black-necked cranes, brown-headed gull, white stork, redshanks, as well as birds like Tibetan snow finch, hoopoe, wool leg sand grouse and a number of larks. Among mammalian life, species are mostly rabbits, rats, and an occasional fox.Currently, the area\u2019s biological importance focuses on education with a public visitors\u2019 center, with walkways to take visitors appropriately into the wetlands, and with periodic educational programs for school children.\n\n\n== History ==\nThat such extensive wetlands existed in this site served likely to be a stimulus for the original growth of Lhasa city as the humidity the wetlands provided in the narrow valley makes the otherwise dry air of Lhasa more moist than the surrounding Tibetan Plateau.\nThe wetlands historically covered about 10 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi), being the flat drainage area between the base of the Gangdise Mountains east of Lhasa City and the Lhasa River (Kyi Chu). A slightly raised northern riverbank prevented the water from directly draining to the river, and along this raised bank a series of structures were historically built\u2014most notably the summer palace of the Dalai Lama the Norbulingka (Jewel Park). This holy retreat site having especially rich vegetation and unusually tall trees because of its better water supply due to underground seepage from the wetlands to the river.\nAs this city expanded in the 7th Century both as a commercial and religious center, the need for additional land space which first went southward from the Potala Palace systematically then started to encroach on the wetlands area, especially with the advent of mechanical equipment that could easily fill in the wetlands and also dig trenches to drain the wet soil to the river.\nAs the city of Lhasa started to grow dramatically in the 1980s, at first this region was seen as accessible land (and hence rapid encroachment began). But by the 1990s the environmental costs to Lhasa were mounting with extensive garbage, polluted water, and a cement factory at the far northern terminus of the wetlands. It was noted that these wetlands were performing vital wastewater purification (a designation then was as the \u201ckidneys of Lhasa\") and also for their catchment of dust during the dust storms (5,500 tons of dust annually were estimated to be trapped), and the then Vice Governor of Tibet, Mao Rubai, a climatologist, started to publicly describe their moistening function to Lhasa\u2019s air.\nInitiating conservation action came from an American environmental worker, Chun-Wuei Su Chien, then in charge of China programs for the international nonprofit organization, Future Generations [4]. Future Generations had been instrumental in setting up a community-based management system for the then first national nature preserve in Tibet, Qomolangma National Nature Preserve. Chien approached the Mayor of Lhasa, a review was conducted by the municipality with study visits led by Chien to community-based conservation projects in the United States looking at high altitude wetlands protection in places like Aspen Colorado, and then the president of Future Generations, Daniel C. Taylor, led a systematic planning endeavor with the city government.\nPreliminary municipal designation occurred in May 25, 1995. Formal protection was implemented by the Tibet Autonomous Region Government in 1999. And national status in July 25, 2005. The detailed management ordinance was approved by the Ninth People\u2019s Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region on July 30, 2010.\n\n\n== Management ==\nThe first vision by the mayor of Lhasa and the American environmental consultants (Chien & Taylor) from Future Generations was that this preserve would center on the children of Lhasa as an educational site. Added to this vision of preservation of the wetlands was the development of \u2018\u2018linkas\u2019\u2019 for public picnic use (a long-standing and much-treasured Tibetan custom). \nAs the preserve\u2019s designation moved through the political processes of regional then national protection designation, in addition to a new road, also added was a traditional vertical fence to limit access especially by livestock.\nCurrently and into the foreseeable future, management of these wetlands is under the leadership of the Tibet Science and Technology Department.\nSince the formal management ordinance of August 2010, the Preserve's 625 hectares (1,540 acres) has been sub-divided into three management zones. A core zone comprising 115 hectares (280 acres) is strictly protected; a buffer zone where limited use is permitted with educational and experimental foci comprises 221 hectares (550 acres); and a third area open for public use comprises an additional 339 hectares (840 acres).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Lhasa or Chengguan is a district and administrative capital of Lhasa City in the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. The inner urban area of Lhasa City is equivalent to the administrative borders of Chengguan District, which is part of the wider prefectural Lhasa City.\nLhasa is the second most populous urban area on the Tibetan Plateau after Xining and, at an altitude of 3,656 metres (11,990 ft), Lhasa is one of the highest cities in the world.  The city has been the religious and administrative capital of Tibet since the mid-17th century. It contains many culturally significant Tibetan Buddhist sites such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka Palaces.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nLhasa literally translates to \"place of gods\" (\u0f63\u0fb7 lha, god; \u0f66 sa, place) in the Tibetan language. Chengguan literally translates to \"urban gateway\" (Chinese: \u57ce\u5173; pinyin: Ch\u00e9nggu\u0101n) in the Chinese language. Ancient Tibetan documents and inscriptions demonstrate that the place was called Rasa (\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66), which either meant \"goats' place\", or, as a contraction of rawe sa, a \"place surrounded by a wall,\" or 'enclosure', suggesting that the site was originally a hunting preserve within the royal residence on Marpori Hill. Lhasa is first recorded as the name, referring to the area's temple of Jowo, in a treaty drawn up between China and Tibet in 822 C.E.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBy the mid 7th century, Songtsen Gampo became the leader of the Tibetan Empire that had risen to power in the Brahmaputra River (locally known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River) Valley. After conquering the kingdom of Zhangzhung in the west, he moved the capital from the Chingwa Takts\u00e9 Castle in Chongye County (pinyin: Qi\u00f3ngji\u00e9 Xi\u00e0n), southwest of Yarlung, to Rasa (Lhasa) where in 637 he raised the first structures on the site of what is now the Potala Palace on Mount Marpori.\nIn CE 639 and 641, Songtsen Gampo, who by this time had conquered the whole Tibetan region, is said to have contracted two alliance marriages,  firstly to a Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal, and then, two years later, to Princess Wencheng of the Imperial Tang court. Bhrikuti is said to have converted him to Buddhism, which was also the faith attributed to his second wife Wencheng. In 641 he constructed the Jokhang (or Rasa Tr\u00fclnang Tsulagkhang) and Ramoche Temples in Lhasa in order to house two Buddha statues, the Akshobhya Vajra (depicting the Buddha at the age of eight) and the Jowo Sakyamuni (depicting Buddha at the age of twelve), respectively brought to his court by the princesses.  Lhasa suffered extensive damage under the reign of Langdarma in the 9th century, when the sacred sites were destroyed and desecrated and the empire fragmented.A Tibetan tradition mentions that after Songtsen Gampo's death in 649 C.E., Chinese troops captured Lhasa and burnt the Red Palace. Chinese and Tibetan scholars have noted that the event is mentioned neither in the Chinese annals nor in the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang. L\u01d0 suggested that this tradition may derive from an interpolation. Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa believes that \"those histories reporting the arrival of Chinese troops are not correct.\"From the fall of the monarchy in the 9th century to the accession of the 5th Dalai Lama, the centre of political power in the Tibetan region was not situated in Lhasa. However, the importance of Lhasa as a religious site became increasingly significant as the centuries progressed. It was known as the centre of Tibet where Padmasambhava magically pinned down the earth demoness and built the foundation of the Jokhang Temple over her heart. Islam has been present since the 11th century in what is considered to have always been a monolithically Buddhist culture. Two Tibetan Muslim communities have lived in Lhasa with distinct homes, food and clothing, language, education, trade and traditional herbal medicine.\nBy the 15th century, the city of Lhasa had risen to prominence following the founding of three large Gelugpa monasteries by Je Tsongkhapa and his disciples. The three monasteries are Ganden, Sera and Drepung which were built as part of the puritanical Buddhist revival in Tibet. The scholarly achievements and political know-how of this Gelugpa Lineage eventually pushed Lhasa once more to centre stage.\nThe 5th Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso (1617\u20131682), unified Tibet and moved the centre of his administration to Lhasa in 1642 with the help of G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut. With G\u00fcshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. The core leadership of this government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, and Lhasa thereafter became both the religious and political capital. In 1645, the reconstruction of the Potala Palace began on Red Hill. In 1648, the Potrang Karpo (White Palace) of the Potala was completed, and the Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time onwards. The Potrang Marpo (Red Palace) was added between 1690 and 1694. The name Potala is derived from Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the Dalai Lama's divine prototype, the Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. The Jokhang Temple was also greatly expanded around this time. Although some wooden carvings and lintels of the Jokhang Temple date to the 7th century, the oldest of Lhasa's extant buildings, such as within the Potala Palace, the Jokhang and some of the monasteries and properties in the Old Quarter date to this second flowering in Lhasa's history.\nBy the end of the 17th century, Lhasa's Barkhor area formed a bustling market for foreign goods. The Jesuit missionary, Ippolito Desideri reported in 1716 that the city had a cosmopolitan community of Mongol, Chinese, Muscovite, Armenian, Kashmiri, Nepalese and Northern Indian traders. Tibet was exporting musk, gold, medicinal plants, furs and yak tails to far-flung markets, in exchange for sugar, tea, saffron, Persian turquoise, European amber and Mediterranean coral. The Qing dynasty army entered Lhasa in 1720, and the Qing government sent resident commissioners, called the Ambans, to Lhasa. In November 11 of 1750, the murder of the regent by the Ambans triggered a riot in the city that left more than a hundred people killed, including the Ambans. After suppressing the rebels, Qing Qianlong Emperor reorganized the Tibetan government and set up the governing council called Kashag in Lhasa in 1751. \n\nIn 1904 a British expedition force led by Francis Younghusband entered Lhasa and forced remaining low-level Tibetan officials to sign the Treaty of Lhasa after the fleeing of Dalai Lama. The treaty was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 Anglo-Chinese treaty. All Qing troops left Lhasa after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1912.\nBy the 20th century, Lhasa, long a beacon for both Tibetan and foreign Buddhists, had numerous ethnically and religiously distinct communities, among them Kashmiri Muslims, Ladakhi merchants, Sikh converts to Islam, and Chinese traders and officials. The Kashmiri Muslims (Khache) trace their arrival in Lhasa to the Muslim saint of Patna, Khair ud-Din, contemporary with the 5th Dalai Lama. Chinese Muslims lived in a quarter to the south, and Newar merchants from Kathmandu to the north of the Barkhor market. Residents of the Lubu neighbourhood were descended from Chinese vegetable farmers who stayed over after accompanying an Amban from Sichuan in the mid-nineteenth century; some later intermarried with Tibetan women and spoke Tibetan as their first language.  The city's merchants catered to all kinds of tastes, importing even Australian butter and British whisky. In the 1940s, according to Heinrich Harrer:-\n\n'There is nothing one cannot buy, or at least order. One even finds the Elizabeth Arden  specialties, and there is a keen demand for them. . .You can order, too, sewing machines, radio sets and gramophones and hunt up Bing Crosby records.' After the establishment of Communist Chinese People's Republic of China, \"(...) the People's Liberation Army (PLA) invaded the country in 1950. In March 1959, an uprising centered on the capital, Lhasa, prompted a massive crackdown, during which the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso (b. 1935), fled into exile.\" Such markets and consumerism came to an abrupt end after the arrival of Chinese government troops and administrative cadres in 1950.  Food rations and poorly stocked government stores replaced the old markets, until the 1990s when commerce in international wares once more returned to Lhasa, and arcades and malls with a cornucopia of goods sprang up.Of the 22 parks (lingkas) which surrounded the city of Lhasa, most of them over half a mile in length, where the people of Lhasa were accustomed to picnic, only three survive today: the Norbulingka, Dalai Lama's Summer Palace, constructed by the 7th Dalai Lama; a small part of the Shugtri Lingka, and the Lukhang. Dormitory blocks, offices and army barracks are built over the rest.\n\nThe Gu\u0101nd\u00ec mi\u00e0o (\u95dc\u5e1d\u5edf) or Gesar Lhakhang temple was erected by the Amban in 1792 atop Mount Bamare 3 kilometres (2 miles) south of the Potala to celebrate the defeat of an invading Gurkha army.The main gate to the city of Lhasa used to run through the large Pargo Kaling chorten and contained holy relics of the Buddha Mindukpa.Between 1987\u20131989 Lhasa experienced major demonstrations, led by monks and nuns, against the Chinese Government. After Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Lhasa was mandated by the government to undergo economic liberalization. All government employees, their families and students were forbidden from practicing their religion, while monks and nuns were not allowed to enter government offices and the Tibet University campus. Subsequent to the introduction of the economic development policies, the influx of migrants has dramatically altered the city's ethnic mix in Lhasa.In 2000 the urbanised area covered 53 square kilometres (20 sq mi), with a population of around 170,000. Official statistics of the metropolitan area report that 70 percent are Tibetan, 34.3 are Han, and the remaining 2.7 Hui, though outside observers suspect that non-Tibetans account for some 50\u201370 percent. Among the Han immigrants, Lhasa is known as 'Little Sichuan'.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLhasa has an elevation of about 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and lies in the centre of the Tibetan Plateau with the surrounding mountains rising to 5,500 m (18,000 ft). The air only contains 68 percent of the oxygen compared to sea level. The Lhasa River, also Kyi River or Kyi Chu, a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Brahmaputra River), runs through the southern part of the city. This river, known to local Tibetans as the \"merry blue waves\", flows through the snow-covered peaks and gullies of the Nyainq\u00eantanglha mountains, extending 315 km (196 mi), and emptying into the Yarlung Zangbo River at Q\u00fcx\u00fc, forms an area of great scenic beauty. The marshlands, mostly uninhabited, are to the north. Ingress and egress roads run east and west, while to the north, the road infrastructure is less developed.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nChengguan District is located on the middle reaches of the Lhasa River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River, with land that rises to the north and south of the river.\nIt is 28 kilometres (17 mi) from east to west and 31 kilometres (19 mi) from north to south.\nChengguan District is bordered by Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District to the west, Dagz\u00ea County to the east and Lh\u00fcnzhub County to the north. \nGonggar County of Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture lies to the south.Chengguan District has an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) and covers 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi).\nThe urban built-up area covers 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi).\nThe average annual temperature of 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F).\nAnnual precipitation is about 500 millimetres (20 in), mostly falling between July and September.The term \"Chengguan District\" is the administrative term for the inner urban area or the urban centre within a prefecture, in this case the Prefectural-city of Lhasa. Outside of the urban area much of Chengguan District is mainly mountainous with a near nonexistent rural population.\nChengguan District is at the same administrative level as a county.\nChengguan District of Lhasa was established on 23 April 1961. \nIt currently has 12 fully urban subdistricts.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDue to its very high elevation, Lhasa has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk) with frosty winters and mild summers, yet the valley location protects the city from intense cold or heat and strong winds. Monthly possible sunshine ranges from 53 percent in July to 84 percent in November, and the city receives nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight annually. It is thus sometimes called the \"sunlit city\" by Tibetans. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of \u22121.6 \u00b0C (29.1 \u00b0F) and the warmest month is June with a daily average of 16.0 \u00b0C (60.8 \u00b0F), though nights have generally been warmer in July. The annual mean temperature is 7.98 \u00b0C (46.4 \u00b0F), with extreme temperatures ranging from \u221216.5 to 30.4 \u00b0C (2 to 87 \u00b0F). Lhasa has an annual precipitation of 426 millimetres (16.8 in) with rain falling mainly in July, August and September. The driest month is January at 0.8 millimetres (0.03 in) and the wettest month is August, at 120.6 millimetres (4.75 in). The rainy season is widely regarded the \"best\" of the year as rains come mostly at night and Lhasa is still sunny during the daytime.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Demographics in the past ===\nThe 11th edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica published between 1910\u20131911 noted the total population of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity was about 30,000; a census in 1854 made the figure 42,000, but it is known to have greatly decreased since. Britannica noted that within Lhasa, there were about a total of 1,500 resident Tibetan laymen and about 5,500 Tibetan women. The permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000). The city's residents included traders from Nepal and Ladak (about 800), and a few from Bhutan, Mongolia and other places. The Britannica noted with interest that the Chinese had a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended carefully after their manner and that the Nepalese supplied mechanics and metal-workers at that time.In the first half of the 20th century, several Western explorers made celebrated journeys to the city, including William Montgomery McGovern, Francis Younghusband, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, and Heinrich Harrer. Lhasa was the centre of Tibetan Buddhism as nearly half of its population were monks, Though this figure may include monks from surrounding monasteries who travelled to Lhasa for various celebrations and were not ordinarily resident there.\nThe majority of the pre-1950 Chinese population of Lhasa were merchants and officials. In the Lubu section of Lhasa, the inhabitants were descendants of Chinese vegetable farmers, some of whom married Tibetan wives. They came to Lhasa in the 1840s\u20131860s after a Chinese official was appointed to the position of Amban.According to one writer, the population of the city was about 10,000, with some 10,000 monks at Drepung and Sera monasteries in 1959. Hugh Richardson, on the other hand, puts the population of Lhasa in 1952, at \"some 25,000\u201330,000\u2014about 45,000\u201350,000 if the population of the great monasteries on its outskirts be included.\"\n\n\n=== Contemporary demographics ===\nThe total population of Lhasa Prefecture-level City is 521,500 (including known migrant population but excluding military garrisons). Of this, 257,400 are in the urban area (including a migrant population of 100,700), while 264,100 are outside. Nearly half of Lhasa Prefecture-level City's population lives in Chengguan District, which is the administrative division that contains the urban area of Lhasa (i.e. the actual city).\nThe urban area is populated by ethnic Tibetans, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups.\nThe 2000 official census gave a total population of 223,001, of which 171,719 lived in the areas administered by city street offices and city neighborhood committees. \n133,603 had urban registrations and 86,395 had rural registrations, based on their place of origin.\nThe census was taken in November, when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet, and did not count the military.\nA 2011 book estimated that up to two-thirds of the city's residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District as a whole is still 63% ethnic Tibetan. As of 2014, half of Tibet's Han population resided in Chengguan District of Lhasa, where bilingual or wholly Chinese teaching was common in the schools.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCompetitive industry together with feature economy play key roles in the development of Lhasa. With the view to maintaining a balance between population growth and the environment, tourism and service industries are emphasised as growth engines for the future.\nMany of Lhasa's rural residents practice traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Lhasa is also the traditional hub of the Tibetan trading network. For many years, chemical and car making plants operated in the area and this resulted in significant pollution, a factor which has changed in recent years. Copper, lead and zinc are mined nearby and there is ongoing experimentation regarding new methods of mineral mining and geothermal heat extraction.\nAgriculture and animal husbandry in Lhasa are considered to be of a high standard. People mainly plant highland barley and winter wheat. The resources of water conservancy, geothermal heating, solar energy and various mines are abundant. There is widespread electricity together with the use of both machinery and traditional methods in the production of such things as textiles, leathers, plastics, matches and embroidery. The production of national handicrafts has made great progress.\n\nWith the growth of tourism and service sectors, the sunset industries which cause serious pollution are expected to fade in the hope of building a healthy ecological system. Environmental problems such as soil erosion, acidification, and loss of vegetation are being addressed. The tourism industry now brings significant business to the region, building on the attractiveness of the Potala Palace, the Jokang, the Norbulingka Summer Palace and surrounding large monasteries as well the spectacular Himalayan landscape together with the many wild plants and animals native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. Tourism to Tibet dropped sharply following the crackdown on protests in 2008, but as early as 2009, the industry was recovering. Chinese authorities plan an ambitious growth of tourism in the region aiming at 10 million visitors by 2020; these visitors are expected to be domestic. With renovation around historic sites, such as the Potala Palace, UNESCO has expressed \"concerns about the deterioration of Lhasa's traditional cityscape.\"\n\nLhasa contains several hotels. Lhasa Hotel is a 4-star hotel located northeast of Norbulingka in the western suburbs of the city. Completed in September 1985, it is the flagship of CITS's installations in Tibet. It accommodates about 1000 guests and visitors to Lhasa. There are over 450 rooms (suites) in the hotel, and all are equipped with air conditioning, mini-bar and other basic facilities. Some of the rooms are decorated in traditional Tibetan style. The hotel was operated by Holiday Inn from 1986 to 1997 and is the subject of a book, The Hotel on the Roof of the World. Another hotel of note is the historical Banak Sh\u00f6l Hotel,  located at 8 Beijing Road in the city. It is known for its distinctive wooden verandas. The Nam-tso Restaurant is located in the vicinity of the hotel and is frequented especially by Chinese tourists visiting Lhasa.\nLhasa contains several businesses of note. Lhasa Carpet Factory,  a factory south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University, produces traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide. It is a modern factory, the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet, employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, and men the spinners, but both work on the rugs today.\nThe Lhasa Brewery Company was established in 1988 on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, south of Sera Monastery and is the highest commercial brewery in the world at 11,975 feet (3,650 m) and accounts for 85 percent of contemporary beer production in Tibet. The brewery, consisting of five-story buildings, cost an estimated US$20\u201325 million, and by 1994, production had reached 30,000 bottles per day, employing some 200 workers by this time. Since 2000, the Carlsberg group has increased its stronghold in the Chinese market and has become increasingly influential in the country with investment and expertise. Carlsberg invested in the Lhasa Brewery in recent years and has drastically improved the brewing facility and working conditions, renovating and expanding the building to what now covers 62,240 square metres (15.3 acres).\n\n\n== Architecture and cityscape ==\n\nLhasa has many sites of historic interest, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Sera Monastery and Norbulingka. The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and the Norbulingka are UNESCO world heritage sites. However, many important sites were damaged or destroyed mostly, but not solely, during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Many have been restored since the 1980s.\nThe Potala Palace, named after Mount Potala, the abode of Chenresig or Avalokitesvara, was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama. After the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the government converted the palace into a museum. The site was used as a meditation retreat by King Songtsen Gampo, who in 637 built the first palace there in order to greet his bride Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang dynasty of China. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (d. 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The palace underwent restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million) and was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994.\n\nThe Lhasa Zhol Pillar, below the Potala, dates as far back as circa 764 CE. and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing. The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in 763 CE during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.\n\nChokpori, meaning  'Iron Mountain',  is a sacred hill, located south of the Potala. It is considered to be one of the four holy mountains of central Tibet and along with two other hills in Lhasa represent the \"Three Protectors of Tibet.\", Chokpori (Vajrapani), Pongwari (Manjushri), and Marpori (Chenresig or Avalokiteshvara). It was the site of the most famous medical school Tibet, known as the Mentsikhang, which was founded in 1413. It was conceived of by Lobsang Gyatso, the \"Great\" 5th Dalai Lama, and completed by the Regent Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho) shortly before 1697.\nLingkhor is a sacred path, most commonly used to name the outer pilgrim road in Lhasa matching its inner twin, Barkhor. The Lingkhor in Lhasa was 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) long enclosing Old Lhasa, the Potala and Chokpori hill. In former times it was crowded with men and women covering its length in prostrations, beggars and pilgrims approaching the city for the first time. The road passed through willow-shaded parks where the Tibetans used to picnic in summer and watch open air operas on festival days. New Lhasa has obliterated most of Lingkhor, but one stretch still remains west of Chokpori.\n\nThe Norbulingka palace and surrounding park is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace and with an area of around 36 hectares (89 acres), it is considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet.\nIt was built from 1755. and served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas until the 14th's self-imposed exile. Norbulingka was declared a 'National Important Cultural Relic Unit\", in 1988 by the State council.  In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. The Sho Dun Festival (popularly known as the \"yogurt festival\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka during the seventh Tibetan month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar.\nThe Barkhor is an area of narrow streets and a public square in the old part of the city located around Jokhang Temple and was the most popular devotional circumambulation for pilgrims and locals. The walk was about one kilometre (0.6 miles) long and encircled the entire Jokhang, the former seat of the State Oracle in Lhasa called the Muru Nyingba Monastery, and a number of nobles' houses including Tromzikhang and Jamkhang. There were four large incense burners (sangkangs) in the four cardinal directions, with incense burning constantly, to please the gods protecting the Jokhang. Most of the old streets and buildings have been demolished in recent times and replaced with wider streets and new buildings. Some buildings in the Barkhor were damaged in the 2008 unrest.\n\nThe Jokhang is located on Barkhor Square in the old town section of Lhasa.  For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. Along with the Potala Palace, it is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Lhasa. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace,\" and a spiritual centre of Lhasa. This temple has remained a key center of Buddhist pilgrimage for centuries. The circumambulation route is known as the \"kora\" in Tibetan and is marked by four large stone incense burners placed at the corners of the temple complex.  The Jokhang temple is a four-story construction, with roofs covered with gilded bronze tiles. The architectural style is based on the Indian vihara design, and was later extended resulting in a blend of Nepalese and Tang dynasty styles. It possesses the statues of Chenresig, Padmasambhava and King Songtsan Gampo and his two foreign brides, Princess Wen Cheng (niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang) and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and other important items.\nRamoche Temple  is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwest of the city, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang, covering a total area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). The temple was gutted and partially destroyed in the 1960s and its famous bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. They have now been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993. Following the major restoration of 1986, the main building in the temple now has three stories.\n\nThe Tibet Museum in Lhasa is the official museum of the Tibet Autonomous Region and was inaugurated on October 5, 1999. It is the first large, modern museum in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has a permanent collection of around 1000 artefacts, from examples of Tibetan art to architectural design throughout history such as Tibetan doors and construction beams. It is located in an L-shaped building west of the Potala Palace on the corner of Norbulingkha Road. The museum is organized into three main sections: a main exhibition hall, a folk cultural garden and administrative offices.The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was unveiled in the Potala Square in May 2002 to celebrate the 51st anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the work in the development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high concrete monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and its name is engraved with the calligraphy of former president Jiang Zemin, while an inscription describes the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThere are some night spots that feature cabaret acts in which performers sing in Chinese, Tibetan, and English. Dancers wear traditional Tibetan costume with long flowing cloth extending from their arms. There are a number of small bars that feature live music, although they typically have limited drink menus and cater mostly to foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Tibet University ===\nTibet University (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f97\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb2\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7a\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b) is the main university of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Its campus is in Chengguan District, Lhasa, east of the city-centre. A forerunner was created in 1952 and the university was officially established in 1985, funded by the Chinese government. About 8000 students are enrolled at the university.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nLhasa has been served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway opened for passenger operations. Reaching an elevation of 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some 2,000 km (1,200 mi) away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. Train number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of passenger, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigaz\u00ea, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.For onward rail travel in South Asia, the closest major station in India is New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri in West Bengal.  However, extension of the Indian railway system to Sikkim will make it easier for onward connections through the South Asian railway network. There are preliminary plans to link Lhasa by rail with Kathmandu.As per a Chinese Tibetan spokesperson, extension of this rail line to Kathmandu with tunneling under Mount Everest is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLhasa Gonggar Airport (IATA: LXA), built in 1965, is the aviation hub of Tibet. It is located south of the city proper. It takes around half an hour to get there by car via the Lhasa Airport Expressway; prior to the completion of the expressway in 2011, the trip to the airport took over an hour. As of 2014, there are daily flights serving major Chinese cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, and there are also occasional scheduled services to Kathmandu in Nepal. Lhasa Airport is the hub of Tibet Airlines, which offers regional services to other destinations in Tibet such as Nyingchi, Ngari Prefecture, Shigatse, and Qamdo.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe Qinghai\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G109) runs northeast toward Xining and eventually to Beijing and is the most-used road in Tibet. The Sichuan\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G318) runs east towards Chengdu and eventually to Shanghai. G318 also runs west to Zhangmu on the Nepal border. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (G219) runs north from Lhasa to Yecheng, and then to Xinjiang. This road is rarely used due to the lack of amenities and petrol stations. A new 37.68 kilometres (23.41 mi), four-lane highway between Lhasa and the Gonggar Airport was built by the Transportation Department of Tibet at a cost of RMB 1.5 billion. This road is part of National Highway 318 and starts from the Lhasa railway station, passes through Caina Township in Qushui County, terminating between the north entrance of the Gala Mountain Tunnel and the south bridgehead of the Lhasa River Bridge, and en route goes over the first overpass of Lhasa at Liuwu Overpass.\n\n\n=== Maritime ===\nThe closest seaports are Kolkata and Haldia in West Bengal, India. The Nathu La pass offers Chinese companies access to the port of Kolkata (Calcutta), situated about 1,100 km (680 mi) from Lhasa, for transshipments to and from Tibet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Lhasa Stadium, which has a capacity of 20,000, is located in Lhasa. It is used mostly for football matches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nMcLeod Ganj\nLeh, India\nMustang, Nepal\nDrapchi Prison or Lhasa Prison No.1\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDesideri (1932).

        "wiki": "Lhasa or Chengguan is a district and administrative capital of Lhasa City in the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. The inner urban area of Lhasa City is equivalent to the administrative borders of Chengguan District, which is part of the wider prefectural Lhasa City.\nLhasa is the second most populous urban area on the Tibetan Plateau after Xining and, at an altitude of 3,656 metres (11,990 ft), Lhasa is one of the highest cities in the world.  The city has been the religious and administrative capital of Tibet since the mid-17th century. It contains many culturally significant Tibetan Buddhist sites such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka Palaces.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nLhasa literally translates to \"place of gods\" (\u0f63\u0fb7 lha, god; \u0f66 sa, place) in the Tibetan language. Chengguan literally translates to \"urban gateway\" (Chinese: \u57ce\u5173; pinyin: Ch\u00e9nggu\u0101n) in the Chinese language. Ancient Tibetan documents and inscriptions demonstrate that the place was called Rasa (\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66), which either meant \"goats' place\", or, as a contraction of rawe sa, a \"place surrounded by a wall,\" or 'enclosure', suggesting that the site was originally a hunting preserve within the royal residence on Marpori Hill. Lhasa is first recorded as the name, referring to the area's temple of Jowo, in a treaty drawn up between China and Tibet in 822 C.E.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBy the mid 7th century, Songtsen Gampo became the leader of the Tibetan Empire that had risen to power in the Brahmaputra River (locally known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River) Valley. After conquering the kingdom of Zhangzhung in the west, he moved the capital from the Chingwa Takts\u00e9 Castle in Chongye County (pinyin: Qi\u00f3ngji\u00e9 Xi\u00e0n), southwest of Yarlung, to Rasa (Lhasa) where in 637 he raised the first structures on the site of what is now the Potala Palace on Mount Marpori.\nIn CE 639 and 641, Songtsen Gampo, who by this time had conquered the whole Tibetan region, is said to have contracted two alliance marriages,  firstly to a Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal, and then, two years later, to Princess Wencheng of the Imperial Tang court. Bhrikuti is said to have converted him to Buddhism, which was also the faith attributed to his second wife Wencheng. In 641 he constructed the Jokhang (or Rasa Tr\u00fclnang Tsulagkhang) and Ramoche Temples in Lhasa in order to house two Buddha statues, the Akshobhya Vajra (depicting the Buddha at the age of eight) and the Jowo Sakyamuni (depicting Buddha at the age of twelve), respectively brought to his court by the princesses.  Lhasa suffered extensive damage under the reign of Langdarma in the 9th century, when the sacred sites were destroyed and desecrated and the empire fragmented.A Tibetan tradition mentions that after Songtsen Gampo's death in 649 C.E., Chinese troops captured Lhasa and burnt the Red Palace. Chinese and Tibetan scholars have noted that the event is mentioned neither in the Chinese annals nor in the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang. L\u01d0 suggested that this tradition may derive from an interpolation. Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa believes that \"those histories reporting the arrival of Chinese troops are not correct.\"From the fall of the monarchy in the 9th century to the accession of the 5th Dalai Lama, the centre of political power in the Tibetan region was not situated in Lhasa. However, the importance of Lhasa as a religious site became increasingly significant as the centuries progressed. It was known as the centre of Tibet where Padmasambhava magically pinned down the earth demoness and built the foundation of the Jokhang Temple over her heart. Islam has been present since the 11th century in what is considered to have always been a monolithically Buddhist culture. Two Tibetan Muslim communities have lived in Lhasa with distinct homes, food and clothing, language, education, trade and traditional herbal medicine.\nBy the 15th century, the city of Lhasa had risen to prominence following the founding of three large Gelugpa monasteries by Je Tsongkhapa and his disciples. The three monasteries are Ganden, Sera and Drepung which were built as part of the puritanical Buddhist revival in Tibet. The scholarly achievements and political know-how of this Gelugpa Lineage eventually pushed Lhasa once more to centre stage.\nThe 5th Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso (1617\u20131682), unified Tibet and moved the centre of his administration to Lhasa in 1642 with the help of G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut. With G\u00fcshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. The core leadership of this government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, and Lhasa thereafter became both the religious and political capital. In 1645, the reconstruction of the Potala Palace began on Red Hill. In 1648, the Potrang Karpo (White Palace) of the Potala was completed, and the Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time onwards. The Potrang Marpo (Red Palace) was added between 1690 and 1694. The name Potala is derived from Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the Dalai Lama's divine prototype, the Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. The Jokhang Temple was also greatly expanded around this time. Although some wooden carvings and lintels of the Jokhang Temple date to the 7th century, the oldest of Lhasa's extant buildings, such as within the Potala Palace, the Jokhang and some of the monasteries and properties in the Old Quarter date to this second flowering in Lhasa's history.\nBy the end of the 17th century, Lhasa's Barkhor area formed a bustling market for foreign goods. The Jesuit missionary, Ippolito Desideri reported in 1716 that the city had a cosmopolitan community of Mongol, Chinese, Muscovite, Armenian, Kashmiri, Nepalese and Northern Indian traders. Tibet was exporting musk, gold, medicinal plants, furs and yak tails to far-flung markets, in exchange for sugar, tea, saffron, Persian turquoise, European amber and Mediterranean coral. The Qing dynasty army entered Lhasa in 1720, and the Qing government sent resident commissioners, called the Ambans, to Lhasa. In November 11 of 1750, the murder of the regent by the Ambans triggered a riot in the city that left more than a hundred people killed, including the Ambans. After suppressing the rebels, Qing Qianlong Emperor reorganized the Tibetan government and set up the governing council called Kashag in Lhasa in 1751. \n\nIn 1904 a British expedition force led by Francis Younghusband entered Lhasa and forced remaining low-level Tibetan officials to sign the Treaty of Lhasa after the fleeing of Dalai Lama. The treaty was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 Anglo-Chinese treaty. All Qing troops left Lhasa after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1912.\nBy the 20th century, Lhasa, long a beacon for both Tibetan and foreign Buddhists, had numerous ethnically and religiously distinct communities, among them Kashmiri Muslims, Ladakhi merchants, Sikh converts to Islam, and Chinese traders and officials. The Kashmiri Muslims (Khache) trace their arrival in Lhasa to the Muslim saint of Patna, Khair ud-Din, contemporary with the 5th Dalai Lama. Chinese Muslims lived in a quarter to the south, and Newar merchants from Kathmandu to the north of the Barkhor market. Residents of the Lubu neighbourhood were descended from Chinese vegetable farmers who stayed over after accompanying an Amban from Sichuan in the mid-nineteenth century; some later intermarried with Tibetan women and spoke Tibetan as their first language.  The city's merchants catered to all kinds of tastes, importing even Australian butter and British whisky. In the 1940s, according to Heinrich Harrer:-\n\n'There is nothing one cannot buy, or at least order. One even finds the Elizabeth Arden  specialties, and there is a keen demand for them. . .You can order, too, sewing machines, radio sets and gramophones and hunt up Bing Crosby records.' After the establishment of Communist Chinese People's Republic of China, \"(...) the People's Liberation Army (PLA) invaded the country in 1950. In March 1959, an uprising centered on the capital, Lhasa, prompted a massive crackdown, during which the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso (b. 1935), fled into exile.\" Such markets and consumerism came to an abrupt end after the arrival of Chinese government troops and administrative cadres in 1950.  Food rations and poorly stocked government stores replaced the old markets, until the 1990s when commerce in international wares once more returned to Lhasa, and arcades and malls with a cornucopia of goods sprang up.Of the 22 parks (lingkas) which surrounded the city of Lhasa, most of them over half a mile in length, where the people of Lhasa were accustomed to picnic, only three survive today: the Norbulingka, Dalai Lama's Summer Palace, constructed by the 7th Dalai Lama; a small part of the Shugtri Lingka, and the Lukhang. Dormitory blocks, offices and army barracks are built over the rest.\n\nThe Gu\u0101nd\u00ec mi\u00e0o (\u95dc\u5e1d\u5edf) or Gesar Lhakhang temple was erected by the Amban in 1792 atop Mount Bamare 3 kilometres (2 miles) south of the Potala to celebrate the defeat of an invading Gurkha army.The main gate to the city of Lhasa used to run through the large Pargo Kaling chorten and contained holy relics of the Buddha Mindukpa.Between 1987\u20131989 Lhasa experienced major demonstrations, led by monks and nuns, against the Chinese Government. After Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Lhasa was mandated by the government to undergo economic liberalization. All government employees, their families and students were forbidden from practicing their religion, while monks and nuns were not allowed to enter government offices and the Tibet University campus. Subsequent to the introduction of the economic development policies, the influx of migrants has dramatically altered the city's ethnic mix in Lhasa.In 2000 the urbanised area covered 53 square kilometres (20 sq mi), with a population of around 170,000. Official statistics of the metropolitan area report that 70 percent are Tibetan, 34.3 are Han, and the remaining 2.7 Hui, though outside observers suspect that non-Tibetans account for some 50\u201370 percent. Among the Han immigrants, Lhasa is known as 'Little Sichuan'.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLhasa has an elevation of about 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and lies in the centre of the Tibetan Plateau with the surrounding mountains rising to 5,500 m (18,000 ft). The air only contains 68 percent of the oxygen compared to sea level. The Lhasa River, also Kyi River or Kyi Chu, a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Brahmaputra River), runs through the southern part of the city. This river, known to local Tibetans as the \"merry blue waves\", flows through the snow-covered peaks and gullies of the Nyainq\u00eantanglha mountains, extending 315 km (196 mi), and emptying into the Yarlung Zangbo River at Q\u00fcx\u00fc, forms an area of great scenic beauty. The marshlands, mostly uninhabited, are to the north. Ingress and egress roads run east and west, while to the north, the road infrastructure is less developed.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nChengguan District is located on the middle reaches of the Lhasa River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River, with land that rises to the north and south of the river.\nIt is 28 kilometres (17 mi) from east to west and 31 kilometres (19 mi) from north to south.\nChengguan District is bordered by Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District to the west, Dagz\u00ea County to the east and Lh\u00fcnzhub County to the north. \nGonggar County of Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture lies to the south.Chengguan District has an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) and covers 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi).\nThe urban built-up area covers 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi).\nThe average annual temperature of 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F).\nAnnual precipitation is about 500 millimetres (20 in), mostly falling between July and September.The term \"Chengguan District\" is the administrative term for the inner urban area or the urban centre within a prefecture, in this case the Prefectural-city of Lhasa. Outside of the urban area much of Chengguan District is mainly mountainous with a near nonexistent rural population.\nChengguan District is at the same administrative level as a county.\nChengguan District of Lhasa was established on 23 April 1961. \nIt currently has 12 fully urban subdistricts.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDue to its very high elevation, Lhasa has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk) with frosty winters and mild summers, yet the valley location protects the city from intense cold or heat and strong winds. Monthly possible sunshine ranges from 53 percent in July to 84 percent in November, and the city receives nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight annually. It is thus sometimes called the \"sunlit city\" by Tibetans. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of \u22121.6 \u00b0C (29.1 \u00b0F) and the warmest month is June with a daily average of 16.0 \u00b0C (60.8 \u00b0F), though nights have generally been warmer in July. The annual mean temperature is 7.98 \u00b0C (46.4 \u00b0F), with extreme temperatures ranging from \u221216.5 to 30.4 \u00b0C (2 to 87 \u00b0F). Lhasa has an annual precipitation of 426 millimetres (16.8 in) with rain falling mainly in July, August and September. The driest month is January at 0.8 millimetres (0.03 in) and the wettest month is August, at 120.6 millimetres (4.75 in). The rainy season is widely regarded the \"best\" of the year as rains come mostly at night and Lhasa is still sunny during the daytime.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Demographics in the past ===\nThe 11th edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica published between 1910\u20131911 noted the total population of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity was about 30,000; a census in 1854 made the figure 42,000, but it is known to have greatly decreased since. Britannica noted that within Lhasa, there were about a total of 1,500 resident Tibetan laymen and about 5,500 Tibetan women. The permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000). The city's residents included traders from Nepal and Ladak (about 800), and a few from Bhutan, Mongolia and other places. The Britannica noted with interest that the Chinese had a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended carefully after their manner and that the Nepalese supplied mechanics and metal-workers at that time.In the first half of the 20th century, several Western explorers made celebrated journeys to the city, including William Montgomery McGovern, Francis Younghusband, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, and Heinrich Harrer. Lhasa was the centre of Tibetan Buddhism as nearly half of its population were monks, Though this figure may include monks from surrounding monasteries who travelled to Lhasa for various celebrations and were not ordinarily resident there.\nThe majority of the pre-1950 Chinese population of Lhasa were merchants and officials. In the Lubu section of Lhasa, the inhabitants were descendants of Chinese vegetable farmers, some of whom married Tibetan wives. They came to Lhasa in the 1840s\u20131860s after a Chinese official was appointed to the position of Amban.According to one writer, the population of the city was about 10,000, with some 10,000 monks at Drepung and Sera monasteries in 1959. Hugh Richardson, on the other hand, puts the population of Lhasa in 1952, at \"some 25,000\u201330,000\u2014about 45,000\u201350,000 if the population of the great monasteries on its outskirts be included.\"\n\n\n=== Contemporary demographics ===\nThe total population of Lhasa Prefecture-level City is 521,500 (including known migrant population but excluding military garrisons). Of this, 257,400 are in the urban area (including a migrant population of 100,700), while 264,100 are outside. Nearly half of Lhasa Prefecture-level City's population lives in Chengguan District, which is the administrative division that contains the urban area of Lhasa (i.e. the actual city).\nThe urban area is populated by ethnic Tibetans, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups.\nThe 2000 official census gave a total population of 223,001, of which 171,719 lived in the areas administered by city street offices and city neighborhood committees. \n133,603 had urban registrations and 86,395 had rural registrations, based on their place of origin.\nThe census was taken in November, when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet, and did not count the military.\nA 2011 book estimated that up to two-thirds of the city's residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District as a whole is still 63% ethnic Tibetan. As of 2014, half of Tibet's Han population resided in Chengguan District of Lhasa, where bilingual or wholly Chinese teaching was common in the schools.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCompetitive industry together with feature economy play key roles in the development of Lhasa. With the view to maintaining a balance between population growth and the environment, tourism and service industries are emphasised as growth engines for the future.\nMany of Lhasa's rural residents practice traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Lhasa is also the traditional hub of the Tibetan trading network. For many years, chemical and car making plants operated in the area and this resulted in significant pollution, a factor which has changed in recent years. Copper, lead and zinc are mined nearby and there is ongoing experimentation regarding new methods of mineral mining and geothermal heat extraction.\nAgriculture and animal husbandry in Lhasa are considered to be of a high standard. People mainly plant highland barley and winter wheat. The resources of water conservancy, geothermal heating, solar energy and various mines are abundant. There is widespread electricity together with the use of both machinery and traditional methods in the production of such things as textiles, leathers, plastics, matches and embroidery. The production of national handicrafts has made great progress.\n\nWith the growth of tourism and service sectors, the sunset industries which cause serious pollution are expected to fade in the hope of building a healthy ecological system. Environmental problems such as soil erosion, acidification, and loss of vegetation are being addressed. The tourism industry now brings significant business to the region, building on the attractiveness of the Potala Palace, the Jokang, the Norbulingka Summer Palace and surrounding large monasteries as well the spectacular Himalayan landscape together with the many wild plants and animals native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. Tourism to Tibet dropped sharply following the crackdown on protests in 2008, but as early as 2009, the industry was recovering. Chinese authorities plan an ambitious growth of tourism in the region aiming at 10 million visitors by 2020; these visitors are expected to be domestic. With renovation around historic sites, such as the Potala Palace, UNESCO has expressed \"concerns about the deterioration of Lhasa's traditional cityscape.\"\n\nLhasa contains several hotels. Lhasa Hotel is a 4-star hotel located northeast of Norbulingka in the western suburbs of the city. Completed in September 1985, it is the flagship of CITS's installations in Tibet. It accommodates about 1000 guests and visitors to Lhasa. There are over 450 rooms (suites) in the hotel, and all are equipped with air conditioning, mini-bar and other basic facilities. Some of the rooms are decorated in traditional Tibetan style. The hotel was operated by Holiday Inn from 1986 to 1997 and is the subject of a book, The Hotel on the Roof of the World. Another hotel of note is the historical Banak Sh\u00f6l Hotel,  located at 8 Beijing Road in the city. It is known for its distinctive wooden verandas. The Nam-tso Restaurant is located in the vicinity of the hotel and is frequented especially by Chinese tourists visiting Lhasa.\nLhasa contains several businesses of note. Lhasa Carpet Factory,  a factory south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University, produces traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide. It is a modern factory, the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet, employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, and men the spinners, but both work on the rugs today.\nThe Lhasa Brewery Company was established in 1988 on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, south of Sera Monastery and is the highest commercial brewery in the world at 11,975 feet (3,650 m) and accounts for 85 percent of contemporary beer production in Tibet. The brewery, consisting of five-story buildings, cost an estimated US$20\u201325 million, and by 1994, production had reached 30,000 bottles per day, employing some 200 workers by this time. Since 2000, the Carlsberg group has increased its stronghold in the Chinese market and has become increasingly influential in the country with investment and expertise. Carlsberg invested in the Lhasa Brewery in recent years and has drastically improved the brewing facility and working conditions, renovating and expanding the building to what now covers 62,240 square metres (15.3 acres).\n\n\n== Architecture and cityscape ==\n\nLhasa has many sites of historic interest, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Sera Monastery and Norbulingka. The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and the Norbulingka are UNESCO world heritage sites. However, many important sites were damaged or destroyed mostly, but not solely, during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Many have been restored since the 1980s.\nThe Potala Palace, named after Mount Potala, the abode of Chenresig or Avalokitesvara, was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama. After the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the government converted the palace into a museum. The site was used as a meditation retreat by King Songtsen Gampo, who in 637 built the first palace there in order to greet his bride Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang dynasty of China. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (d. 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The palace underwent restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million) and was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994.\n\nThe Lhasa Zhol Pillar, below the Potala, dates as far back as circa 764 CE. and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing. The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in 763 CE during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.\n\nChokpori, meaning  'Iron Mountain',  is a sacred hill, located south of the Potala. It is considered to be one of the four holy mountains of central Tibet and along with two other hills in Lhasa represent the \"Three Protectors of Tibet.\", Chokpori (Vajrapani), Pongwari (Manjushri), and Marpori (Chenresig or Avalokiteshvara). It was the site of the most famous medical school Tibet, known as the Mentsikhang, which was founded in 1413. It was conceived of by Lobsang Gyatso, the \"Great\" 5th Dalai Lama, and completed by the Regent Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho) shortly before 1697.\nLingkhor is a sacred path, most commonly used to name the outer pilgrim road in Lhasa matching its inner twin, Barkhor. The Lingkhor in Lhasa was 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) long enclosing Old Lhasa, the Potala and Chokpori hill. In former times it was crowded with men and women covering its length in prostrations, beggars and pilgrims approaching the city for the first time. The road passed through willow-shaded parks where the Tibetans used to picnic in summer and watch open air operas on festival days. New Lhasa has obliterated most of Lingkhor, but one stretch still remains west of Chokpori.\n\nThe Norbulingka palace and surrounding park is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace and with an area of around 36 hectares (89 acres), it is considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet.\nIt was built from 1755. and served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas until the 14th's self-imposed exile. Norbulingka was declared a 'National Important Cultural Relic Unit\", in 1988 by the State council.  In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. The Sho Dun Festival (popularly known as the \"yogurt festival\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka during the seventh Tibetan month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar.\nThe Barkhor is an area of narrow streets and a public square in the old part of the city located around Jokhang Temple and was the most popular devotional circumambulation for pilgrims and locals. The walk was about one kilometre (0.6 miles) long and encircled the entire Jokhang, the former seat of the State Oracle in Lhasa called the Muru Nyingba Monastery, and a number of nobles' houses including Tromzikhang and Jamkhang. There were four large incense burners (sangkangs) in the four cardinal directions, with incense burning constantly, to please the gods protecting the Jokhang. Most of the old streets and buildings have been demolished in recent times and replaced with wider streets and new buildings. Some buildings in the Barkhor were damaged in the 2008 unrest.\n\nThe Jokhang is located on Barkhor Square in the old town section of Lhasa.  For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. Along with the Potala Palace, it is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Lhasa. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace,\" and a spiritual centre of Lhasa. This temple has remained a key center of Buddhist pilgrimage for centuries. The circumambulation route is known as the \"kora\" in Tibetan and is marked by four large stone incense burners placed at the corners of the temple complex.  The Jokhang temple is a four-story construction, with roofs covered with gilded bronze tiles. The architectural style is based on the Indian vihara design, and was later extended resulting in a blend of Nepalese and Tang dynasty styles. It possesses the statues of Chenresig, Padmasambhava and King Songtsan Gampo and his two foreign brides, Princess Wen Cheng (niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang) and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and other important items.\nRamoche Temple  is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwest of the city, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang, covering a total area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). The temple was gutted and partially destroyed in the 1960s and its famous bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. They have now been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993. Following the major restoration of 1986, the main building in the temple now has three stories.\n\nThe Tibet Museum in Lhasa is the official museum of the Tibet Autonomous Region and was inaugurated on October 5, 1999. It is the first large, modern museum in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has a permanent collection of around 1000 artefacts, from examples of Tibetan art to architectural design throughout history such as Tibetan doors and construction beams. It is located in an L-shaped building west of the Potala Palace on the corner of Norbulingkha Road. The museum is organized into three main sections: a main exhibition hall, a folk cultural garden and administrative offices.The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was unveiled in the Potala Square in May 2002 to celebrate the 51st anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the work in the development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high concrete monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and its name is engraved with the calligraphy of former president Jiang Zemin, while an inscription describes the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\nThere are some night spots that feature cabaret acts in which performers sing in Chinese, Tibetan, and English. Dancers wear traditional Tibetan costume with long flowing cloth extending from their arms. There are a number of small bars that feature live music, although they typically have limited drink menus and cater mostly to foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Tibet University ===\nTibet University (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f97\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb2\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7a\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b) is the main university of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Its campus is in Chengguan District, Lhasa, east of the city-centre. A forerunner was created in 1952 and the university was officially established in 1985, funded by the Chinese government. About 8000 students are enrolled at the university.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nLhasa has been served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway opened for passenger operations. Reaching an elevation of 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some 2,000 km (1,200 mi) away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. Train number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of passenger, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigaz\u00ea, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.For onward rail travel in South Asia, the closest major station in India is New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri in West Bengal.  However, extension of the Indian railway system to Sikkim will make it easier for onward connections through the South Asian railway network. There are preliminary plans to link Lhasa by rail with Kathmandu.As per a Chinese Tibetan spokesperson, extension of this rail line to Kathmandu with tunneling under Mount Everest is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLhasa Gonggar Airport (IATA: LXA), built in 1965, is the aviation hub of Tibet. It is located south of the city proper. It takes around half an hour to get there by car via the Lhasa Airport Expressway; prior to the completion of the expressway in 2011, the trip to the airport took over an hour. As of 2014, there are daily flights serving major Chinese cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, and there are also occasional scheduled services to Kathmandu in Nepal. Lhasa Airport is the hub of Tibet Airlines, which offers regional services to other destinations in Tibet such as Nyingchi, Ngari Prefecture, Shigatse, and Qamdo.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe Qinghai\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G109) runs northeast toward Xining and eventually to Beijing and is the most-used road in Tibet. The Sichuan\u2013Tibet Highway (part of G318) runs east towards Chengdu and eventually to Shanghai. G318 also runs west to Zhangmu on the Nepal border. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (G219) runs north from Lhasa to Yecheng, and then to Xinjiang. This road is rarely used due to the lack of amenities and petrol stations. A new 37.68 kilometres (23.41 mi), four-lane highway between Lhasa and the Gonggar Airport was built by the Transportation Department of Tibet at a cost of RMB 1.5 billion. This road is part of National Highway 318 and starts from the Lhasa railway station, passes through Caina Township in Qushui County, terminating between the north entrance of the Gala Mountain Tunnel and the south bridgehead of the Lhasa River Bridge, and en route goes over the first overpass of Lhasa at Liuwu Overpass.\n\n\n=== Maritime ===\nThe closest seaports are Kolkata and Haldia in West Bengal, India. The Nathu La pass offers Chinese companies access to the port of Kolkata (Calcutta), situated about 1,100 km (680 mi) from Lhasa, for transshipments to and from Tibet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Lhasa Stadium, which has a capacity of 20,000, is located in Lhasa. It is used mostly for football matches.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nMcLeod Ganj\nLeh, India\nMustang, Nepal\nDrapchi Prison or Lhasa Prison No.1\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDesideri (1932).

          "A must visit when in Lhasa. Beautiful both on the outside and inside. Due to the high altitude, try not to visit immediately after arriving into Lhasa as there's a lot of climbing involved and hence it is best to climatise. For those suffering from altitude sickness, there are",
          "Even if you are suffering from slight altitude sickness this place is not to be missed. We bought some oxygen water at the entrance, a gimmick I\u2019m sure, but I had a little altitude sickness and still made it to the top. So happy I did. Wow, really amazing. Surreal feeling that",

          "History and grandeur are incredible. Ignore the wimps who whine about the steps. You can do it. Some Tibetan pilgrims go up those steps on their knees. Go with a guide if possible, much more enjoyable. This is a UNESCO site for good reason. A must.",
          "Potala Palace or the Winter Palace of the Dalai Lamas is hard to miss and located right in the middle of Lhasa city. The palace is beautiful and grand and a sight to behold specially during evenings. The palace is now more of a tourist attraction and has been declared a Heritage",
          "Awesome buulding in the mountains. Although a museum now it used to be the summer palace of the Dalai Lamas. Breathtaking scenery and a must to visit if you are in Tibet. (it is also a world heritage site) Tip - get a guide to show you round. They are a wealth of information.",
          "I had very high expectations of potala palace and it looks great from the outside but i think seeing it from the outside and taking a brilliant photo is enough. the long trek up so many hundreds of stairs is killing and it is very run down inside and most of the rooms we were",
          "Potala Palace- home of the the Dalai Lamas- sits atop a huge hill and is only accessed via hundreds of steep, stone steps. The journey to the palace is not for the weak because it takes perseverance to reach the top. To illustrate, while I visited I watched a young man",
          "Very beautiful palace, trully must see. No doubt its the best Monastary in Lhasa, had a great tour to the palace and the oportunity to see the Dalai Lama room and study area.",
          "Being well acclimatized before visiting this holy place cannot be recommended often enough as it anyway will take your breath away. There are many steps to go and therefore it makes sense to visit earliest on the second day after arrival, we did at third day. It was always one",
          "There are no words to describe the history and understated elegance of the palace. Take a guided tour to experience the most, multi language handsets are available.",
          "The former home of the Dali Lama, this is by far the coolest of the three monasteries that I visited in Lhasa. Very interesting to see where he lived and studied.",
          "Go as early as possible to beat the crowds. If you have not acclimated to the altitude, plan on taking a very long time to go up the 320 steps to the top of the palace. It will be worth the slow and steady effort it takes. Like most things in China, \"Hockey Rules\" apply to get",
          "Amazing place. It's a climb to get there, especially if you're not acclimated to the altitude. Carefully controlled entrance with tickets and it's a bit confusing, but well worth it to see.",

          "It is very picturesque but unless you are fit and able, it is impossible to view inside. There is a film shown in the courtyard, so it is not necessary to climb up. If you need the toilets, use these, as outside the complex they are terrible.",

          "To walk through parts of this palace is awesome. So much interesting history and religious figures and glory. You feel it in your gut. As for pictures you may take photographs of the exterior. Not allowed to take pictures of the interior. Act with respect. No one go to Lhasa",

          "This is something that can\u2019t be missed. Even the locals take the climb slowly. For those that are not used to the altitude just take it easy and steady with lots of stops on the way up. The view from the top and the tour around the palace is well worth the effort and a must do.",
          "It was fairly quiet when we were there in early October so there was no pushing or jostling even in the narrower stairways. All very polite and no problems. Much has been posted about the palace already so just 2 things for me to say really :- 1) Take plenty of rest stops!",
          "This is an important visit with a few caveats. The hike up is about 500 feet in elevation, no problem at sea level, but difficult for many at 12,000 feet. It is crowded inside, with narrow stuffy passages and shoving tourists. But it is something to see this 7 th century royal",

          "I visited as part of a group tour. I had seen pictures before but did not realise how big it was. We visited on our 3rd day in Lhasa, which allowed a couple of days to acclimatize before climbing up all the stairs. Also went at sunset the night before to get photos which I",

          "I enjoyed it a lot. Admittedly, I enjoyed the outside and the climb more than the tour inside. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was super impressive, but groups usually only have one hour and there is so much history and so much to take in, way too less time, but I understand that there",

          "This place is amazing and climbing and descending 530 steps is a bit of a challenge. You are only allowed one hour from entry to exit, so a tour guide is needed to point out and explain the many features about Buddha and Buddhism for one to get any understanding of the many",

          "This must be one of the top sites in the world, full of character and history. It cannot be missed. If you visit in peak season, you'll only have an hour to visit (and your guide will ensure that you are out in time - or they lose their permit to visit). It is busy and feel",

          "The Palace was incredible - by day and night. The entry fee was picked up by the tour company, but from memory, the costs were fairly minimal. There are bag checks, but nothing you wouldn't expect. The queues after security were no more than 20 minutes in duration. Groups",
          "Potala Palace is a unique icon of Tibet. Once you reach Lhasa and you will never miss this icon as it is built on top of a hill. This unique world heritage site is really filled with many history and also amazing architecture which still maintain the uniqueness until now. Here",

          "Glad we had a few days to adjust to the elevation before climbing to the top of Potala Palace. It is breathtaking and a must do in Lhasa. You can even see a picture of the palace on the fifty yuan bill. Absolutely magnificent to visit. One of the highlights of visiting",
          "At 13,000 feet the air is thin, so beware you may feel faint. Your hotel should be able to provide you with some oxygen when you return. Go slow...no need to rush, but remember, you'll be going up an addition 1000 feet as you explore the Palace.",
          "One of the iconic places to visit in Lhasa. Known as the winter palace of the Dalai Lama's it sits 130m above the valley. Your guide must buy a ticket the day before and there are time frames to meet while touring. There was more to see inside the White and Red palaces than I",
          "All is calm and quiet, body, mind and spirit in use to ease your access and steep climb up the almost 500 steps outside....not to count the hundreds within the palace area and it's buildings. This is a must visit and worth every effort and time to enjoy it.",
          "Highly recommended. Definitely worth the 432 steps to climb, the star attraction of Lhasa. Take it easy if you have flown into Lhasa and acclimatise to the altitude.",
          "The palace looks beautiful from below. It is just off the city centre and easy to access. Unfortunately there are a lot of stairs to climb to access it - and remember this is at an elevation so climbing it is not for the faint-hearted, so you need to take it easy. Most of the",
          "Quite a place. Rich in Tibetan history and a must see if you are in Lhasa. There are VERY many steps and you may need to stop to eat severalties but the trek is worth while. Many centuries of Tibetan life are reflected here.",
          "This is the place must visit if you are in Lhasa. Very interesting with full of culture and history!",
          "Good experience but you need to book the ticket in advance and be there at the specific time as stated in the ticket. Usually, it is booked by the tour agent for you. It\u2019s a must visit place if you\u2019re in Lhasa",
          "As one grows up, the Potala Palace is at the top of your bucket list, just like the Eiffel Tower or the Vatican. Make sure you're up to the climb to the very top. the city is already at 4000 meters altitude altitude, so that you get out breath very easily, then steps and steps",
          "Such a beautiful temple. A once in a lifetime experience, climbing straight up 500 very steep and uneven steps, at 12,000ft. elevation. Well worth the shortness of breath every few hounded feet, to make the visit.",
          "You have seen pictures, but they do the palace little justice. Too bad you cant linger on your own and take in the aura of this place. It is very crowded and the tours rush you through the place because you only get 50 minutes to visit.",
          "In 2010, I went to Tibet, China and visited the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The place is named after Mount Potalaka. This amazing palace has the honor of being the highest ancient palace in the world. The palace is 13-stories,reaching 12,300 feet. I recommend you going there in the",
          "One of the best known sights of the world - visiting it is like a dream come true. Strenuous due the hight altitude but worth every effort. Spend as much time as you can - it is worth every minute!",
          "Yes, the Potala Palace is not just from outside a masterpiece of Tibetan architecture it is very interesting and unique what you can explore inside. Even there are for sure a lot of people on the way through this labyrinth it is something really different to experience. Just to",
          "This tour was great. I enjoyed every minute of it. The climb wasnt too bad, if you're in shape. The exterior views are fantastic, the building is enormous, and the views of Lhasa on the way up are terrific. The interiors are historic, amazing, and so interesting. You really",
          "We enjoyed our tour pf Potala Palace. It is an amazing place with so much history and religion. That being said, be mindful of the many steps it takes to get to the Dalai Lama residence on the 13th floor of the Palace.",
          "My wife and i prepared for this part of trip by taking the altitude pills. I think they helped as we were short of breath but never sick while in Tibet. See your doctor for these pills! The stairs going up are not tough if you just take your time. We were all over 65 and did",
          "Enjoyed our visit here. Tough climbing up to the top to start the tour due to the altitude. We did it on our second full day in Lhasa and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t try on day 1!",
          "Hard work climbing up to the top with the altitude but worth it. Walked down through the rooms. Doesn\u2019t seem as \u2018alive\u2019 as other places visited in Lhasa",
          "It was a majestic palace and a must visit! The climbing up is a bit strenous due to high altitude but always stop and enjoy the views. Take your time and soak in the view.",
          "A gorgeous site; but lots of steps to climb to the top. I counted over 400 steps, then lost count. I was told there were over 1000 rooms, but I visit only 20 rooms, then I was tire of seeing the same things over and over again. Unless you want to see 'everything' I suggest that",
          "Potala Palace is an amazing place. From its construction to the items it houses, everything is amazing about this place. Its a definite must see!!",
          "The place is an iconic representation of Tibet. Last place for the Dali Lama who is now in exile. Structure is beautifully maintained. A climb to the top is quite a challenge but the beauty can be appreciated from the grounds. The museum is top notch. A must see for",
          "The Potala Palace is incredible! So much history and culture in one place. I highly recommend a visit. Also visit the park across the road at night to see the palace lit up in all its glory.",
          "Just an amazing place to see. Even better up close. Well worth climbing up all the steps and seeing it from the inside. The inside is just as breathtaking as the outside. Definitely go at night and take photos from plaza across the street. The palace is all lite up.",
          "This is the iconic symbol of Lhasa no visit here is complete without it. Be prepared to climb stairs at 12000 ft this is not easy. The tombs of the Dalai lamas are here. While there are a limited number of the 1000 rooms available to see the highlights are covered in a walking",
          "Lots of steps, but the view is well worth it. Kids enjoyed this palace the most! Breathtaking to look at from the bottom.",
          "It was started in the 7th. century and it is a marvel how they managed to build it. About 300 steps to climb to the Palace. At almost 13,000 feet you don't climb very fast but worth the climb. Because so many people visit the Palace you have a 50 minute tour and have to be out.",
          "Lots of stairs to climb so may not be accessible to all but well worth the climb. Very interesting with lots of history. Beautiful inside but was unable to take pictures inside.",
          "As if this place needs a review -- it's epic!! One of the wonders of the world. Take a guided tour, walk around the gardens in back, too.",
          "Incredible, a true spectacle. Recommend going with a good tour guide who can talk you through the rich history of this building. Well worth the climb to the top, some great views back onto the city.",
          "Such a humble place, not so bad a hike up to the top. Loads of Buddha inside with fascinating faces and expressions and great views from outside",
          "Impressive palace but limited to 50 minutes tour visit. It is insufficient to have a good tour within 50 minutes.",
          "It\u2019s the Potala Palace! There may be some problems with crowds and limited time for visits, there\u2019s a lot of steps, and the altitude will slow down some, but it\u2019s still pretty spectacular and probably the main reason you\u2019re here. We enjoyed our visit to Lhasa and visiting the",
          "Holy site of Tibet and also recognized my UNESCO as world heritage. There are daily restrictions of how many visitors allowed and require pre registration but your local tour guide can handle it for you.",
          "This is even more beautiful in reality. The best light is in the morning. The tour around the political part is interesting. And the religious part is even more interesting, because you get a feeling of how it was when the 14th Dalai Lama was still living there. The chinese",
          "If you are in Lhasa this is the first place you just have to visit. It is very big and impressive and I wish we could spent longer time inside. But altitude sickness can catch up with you.",
          "None of us expected to be able to finish 432 steps of the palace during a hot sunny day. We were all panting due to thin air. We took our pace slow and took breaks few times to catch up our breathe. There were drink stalls when we finished (almost) all the 432 steps to the peak",
          "We had our guide organise this traip - which I am glad we did. There is a time limit for your visit - because it is always very busy. This palace is an archiatectural masterpiece. It over looks Lhasa from 130m - so yes lots of steps but what fantastic views. There are two main",
          "Greatly enjoyed this iconic location, both inside and out with street views from various directions. Entry permits are tightly scheduled and are checked multiple times during the tour. Very impressive to see the interior.",
          "This impressive place, now a museum kind of reflect the past... Even if it was too crowded, the visit left a feeling of deep spiritual practice.",
          "Unbelievable unique must-see palace and temple. Be prepared for lots of step climbing in 10,000+ ft elevation. Also, the government only allows 45 minutes for the entire inside visit (the climbing is outside and doesn't count against the time limit). This is strictly enforce;",
          "Despite the number of tourists , it\u2019s an amazing place to visit .. Our Guide took the entrance ticket , and i really feel it should be impossible by yourself (limited number of visitors , time slot..) . When you are in the palace you can\u2019t take any pictures . You can only spent",
          "Great to walk around the many rooms of the Palace and hear a detailed history from our well-informed guide. Fascinating stuff. A lot of walking, but well worth it.",
          "Refer to my review of Tibet Travellers, whom we use. Patola Palace was beautiful, does require some fitness to walk to the top but you won't regret making that journey!",
          "difficult to get the ticket online. We booked through agent. We spend about 2.5hours here. Nice to visit this unforgettable palace.",
          "This is a must see in Lhasa. As a foreigner I had to enter with a tour guide and we were kept to a time limit of how long we could stay. However the time limit is enough to walk through everything that is open to public. It\u2019s very grand and I would go again.",
          "This is what TIbet is all about, make sure you get there early in the morning otherwise it gets really crowded.",
          "A must see. Limited visiting time but great experience. A lot os steep steps, be careful especially if raining !",
          "It's a pity we only have one hour to visit this phenomenal place. Also many rooms are now closed, due to chinese constraints. Poor tib\u00e9tains...",
          "Magnificent building even if you've seen pictures of it so many times before it doesn't do justice to the real deal. A lot of steps might be a bit troublesome for older people or people with bad knees like myself. It's more impressive from the outside than on the inside. But you",
          "it is so great to get to see this place where centuries history is still alive. although only part of potala palace open to public, it is worth a visit",
          "Visiting the Potala Palace is definitly one of the must do's on a Tibet Trip. Its an amazing building from outside and inside. Its probably just once in Lifetime that You will have the Chance to be so Close to the culture and History of Tibet. Infos & Tips: 1.You will need to",
          "Unfortunately they don't allow indoor photography. But maybe that is part of the magic. You'll be completely surprised by what you see. Potala alone justifies a trip to Lhasa.",
          "Not much words to describe this wonder. Palace on the other extreme end of scale compared with European Palaces.",
          "As beautiful and spiritual as you expect from photos - you only see about 20 of the 1000 rooms, but you get a good feeling for the palace. Well worth it to spend an hour or two - but you are required to come with a guide in order to buy tickets. Oh and like most temples, no",
          "Outstanding, 272 steps to clim up but its worth it, Great history and experience, panoramic view... Representation of Tibetian history and culture",

          "Imposing structure that looms over Lhasa is a must visit. It requires you to climb many steps, so it is a good test of how well you are acclimatized to the altitude. The buildings and their construction are very impressive, and the glimpses of the monastic life and of the",
          "Truly a highlight of visiting Tibet. The ancient hallways rooms and constant aroma of incense is like stepping back in time. Can get crowded depending on your visitation schedule but so worth it",
          "The price to get to the palace is high and you get only 50 minutes. They also give you a time when you are allowed to get in, so in our case it was 9:00 in the morning. We thought that was a great time as we expected that it will be not a lot of people. When we arrived there was",
          "30$ usd admission for 50 min in main palace- cannot spend longer in high season. Very rushed- unable to really appreciate all the beautiful art. Spectacular- dalai lama\u2019s receiving room, office. Assembly hall- the funeral stupa of past dalai lamas. 800 lb gold stupa for the 5th",
          "It's an amazing experience to climb to the Pota palace. At the base you will see hundred of people walking around in pilgrimage and you will see many of the doing \"the prostration\". Going to the top is demanding, 1080 steps at 3060 mts (10,000ft) that is the altitude of Lhasa.",

          "Very busy and quite rushed due to the one hour limit but well worth it. A lot of steps to reach it which can be challenging if you're still acclimatising but just take it steady and enjoy the views. Any water will be confiscated at security and you'll have to rebuy small",
          "The visit to the palace requires climbing stairs. We booked the trip through the agency so all entrance fees have been covered. There are multiple rooms in the palace and there are places where you are not allowed to take photos. Some locals also do not like having their photos",

          "From the base of Potala Palace, the climb up to the top certainly looks very daunting. Somehow I managed to to make it up and down , taking my ownself by surprise. So yes, I did feel a certain sense of personal achievement. If anyone has any doubts when they stand at the base",

          "Finally after 50 something years we made it. The Chinese government delayed our groups visa, so our first day in Lhasa we're walking up all those steps. Our guide was fantastic, waiting for everyone in the group to make each turn together. You can only marvel at the history of",

          "It is truly a must see in Lhasa. Palace looks great from outside and you can take a bunch of photos from the hill across the street from it. The only downside is that in the evening Chinese play loud music on the square in front of it, and it is really disturbing. The inside is",

          "Visited the Potala in winter, at the time of the pilgrimages. We were the only western faces on site, so we experienced the local Tibetan ways very well. The climbing was hard, especially taking into consideration the altitude sickness we had. But it was a highlight of our Asian",

          "Be prepared to climb the 400 stairs of Potala in grace..! For those who are not used to the high altitude, I would suggest that you take an afternoon off to walk the streets of Lhasa when you first arrive in this city, before committing yourself to the spiritual walk in Potala",
          "This is one of the most amazing palace that everybody must visit. It is beautiful and stunning from the exterior. You will learn a lot of Tibetan culture by just visiting this palace. I would suggest to bring a Tibetan guide instead of a Chinese guide for the real Tibetan",

          "The interior of the palace was mInd-boggling - I've never seen so many statures and gold! If you are only going to visit one building in Tibet then this is it. The tour includes the private living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and the chapels where they worshipped. There are many",

          "This is like the Western Wall in Jerusalem for the Tibetans. People come from all over the world to visit this place. They only allow a set # of tourists visiting each day. Therefore, getting the tickets in advance is strongly recommended. It's better to research and enlist help",
          "This place is a must see in Lhasa, the size of the place is just breathtaking. The inside of the palace is like a labyrinth with many corridors and doors you are bound to get lost and emmerse yourself in the rich Buddhist culture",

          "The visit to the palace is as hyped as it gets. The steps up the Potala Palace is more like ramp than steps; so even at 3600m, the ascend is still okay. You do not have to be particularly fit. The architecture is amazing on both the inside and outside; and you would be better",
          "a true wonder of the world, very strenuous, high altitude, take your time, many stairs to climb, which is thirteen levels to the palace",
          "As soon as I see Potala Palace, I feel home as I grew up here. We brought three people from Boulder on Conscious Journeys to Lhasa as a graduation gift for their son Evan and this is the best gift ever,",
          "Our visit to Potala Palace was great, the Palace is great but you need to be fit to go over the 300 steps to reach it, the time that you can stay inside the Palace is controled, but the visit totally worth it!",
          "Love the architecture of the Potala Palace! The buildings were distinguished by the color red/ white for the usages. The building itself is very strong, withstand the destruction from cultural revolution. One thing though, too many tourists! But so far it is one of my favorite",

          "Unbelievable palace at such plateau in the middle of the mountain. You need to bring loads of water for this trip since you will need to climb up quite high and a lot of walking there. But definitely worth a visit. Since water bottles and oxygen aren't allowed to be brought",
          "ok it is a landmark and looks impressive from the outside but that is where I wished I had stayed - its a steep climb up 500 steps to be rewarded with - well, not much. if you have seen any monastery in Tibet then there is nothing much different here or anything strange or",
          "I've seen a lot of palaces, but this one is the most awesome to look at from the street on a sunny day. The view at night is spectacular as well. The tour of the interior is not Versailles, but it is still very unique and awe inspiring!",
          "A journey to Lhasa will remain incomplete without visiting the Potala Palace. Its architecture is remarkable and it has an excellent collection of idols , paintings and religious books. Bodies of some earlier Dalai Lamas and a few other religious leaders are also kept here in",
          "Walking around the palace you see those who are prostrating themselves. Inside there's everything related to Tibetan Buddhism. Quite spectacular. An absolute must see. But you already know that if you're in Lhasa!",

          "The first time you see this place it really is breathtaking. Nothing can prepare you for it. The mountains in the background simply add to its majesty. It's worth visiting Potala Square during the day, sunset and at night to see the Palace in all its glory. At sunset there is a",
          "The Potala Palace is why we are here in Tibet. We pre-purchased the tickets but failed to get in because of the fault and mis-handling of our travel agents (Wing On Travel apps jointly offered with Ctrip). So, we only look at the Potala Palace from the outside and it is truly",
          "Located at the amazing place in Lhasa. If you are in Lhasa, you most to visit this place, don't miss this chance. It is a former home of Dalai Lama. You will learn about culture and history. I cannot recommend highly enough!!!",
          "Be sure to go up slowly, and don't be surprised if your ascent becomes difficult and you opt to forego the climb. If you do go up, be aware that there is no picture-taking inside the palace.",
          "The stairs are killing me, especially not being fully adjusted to the elevation. The place is too crowded to fully enjoy the place, but it is amazing nevertheless. The view from the Dalai Lama quarter is magnificent! In spring, the courtyard and the stairs going up the palace",
          "What an incredible place. However, beware, to enter the palace you must climb so many steps. This is only a feat for visitors in great shape! You must get a ticket in advance--with a guide--and you must show your passport when you purchase the ticket. There is a market at the",

          "With over a 1000 rooms of the palace a day would be impossible to visit in one day, but with the help of a guide you shall be able to get a glimpse of the culture and religion of Tibet. Potala palace is well worth the visit, but better be careful with the way up stairs, bring",
          "Sometimes there can be long lines outside, and you'd wait in the sun, so be sure to bring a hat or wear sunscreen. The sun can be very strong here. Also, there are a lot of stairs to climb to reach the inside, so may not be the best to come here on your first day to Tibet if",
          "We walked it during daylight hours, through a long line that snakes around the grounds. There are hundreds of steps, and while it might wind some people at home, at this altitude, you really notice your muscles getting tired quickly. Some religious folk prostrate themselves on",

          "If you're only in Lhasa for one day (like I was), make this the priority. The scale of the place is mind-blowing. Make sure you go all the way to the top, it's a fun hike up some narrow corridors and up some ladders. Truly unbelievable experience!",
          "Hard to explain in words. It was touch. For one(s) who really feel about history/ relegion/ and faith... No photo taken after the you step inside the palace, you must experience everything with your eyes and heart.",
          "A world landmark, it was one of the must sees on my bucket list. Be prepared for long walks and climbing steps, steep stairways and ladders, but well worth the effort. Don't forget to go back after dark to see it lit by floodlights, from below it looks to be floating in mid",

          "Potala Palace is definitely the centrepiece of any trip to Tibet. It's absolutely magnificent. Only a fraction of the Palace is viewable by the general public, but these include the chambers of the more recent Dalai Lamas, and the stupas where previous Dalai Lamas are buried.",
          "This should not be missed. It was beautiful. We walked around it to experience what the local people do. It was a great chance to see their dedication to the faith. There are a lot of stairs to get to the top. If you take it slow and easy it is very doable. You come down a",

          "Recommend visitors try not go in peak season. We went in shoulder season so we have good weather and not so long queue that u can go without prior booking, cheaper entrance ticket (50% of peak). Most importantly, u can walk and view the place slowly. This place is historic,",
          "It is indeed a must visit place in a life time. A guided tour is preferred so you get to know the history of this magnificient wooden structure. All the statues are in gold that you cannot believe. You've got to see the place in your own eyes and climb the stairs while coping",

          "Great photos from park across street from the Potala. Go back after dark for a night view. Proudly buffed and puffed my body up the many steps to the museum. Saw where the dali Lamar lived, met others, slept etc. Route takes you down on the back side to a nice park. Do not",

It is located in Gurum in Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District, Tibet Autonomous Region, China, 70 kilometres (43 mi) from Lhasa.\nThe monastery is about 4,300 metres (14,100 ft) above sea level. It was built in the middle of the valley facing south with high mountains surrounding the complex.\nTsurphu is a 300-square-meter (3,200 sq ft) complex with walls up to 4 meters (13 ft) thick. The gompa, the traditional seat of the Karmapa lamas, is about 28 kilometres (17 mi) up the Dowo Lung Valley on the north side of the river. The original walls of the main building were up to 4 meters thick and 300 meters on each side (90,000 square meters or 970,000 square feet). The monks' residences were on the eastern side.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTsurphu was founded by D\u00fcsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110-1193) in 1159, after he visited the site and laid the foundation for an establishment of a seat there by making offerings to the local protectors, the dharmapalas and territorial divinities (Wylie: yul lha). In 1189 he revisited the site and founded his main seat there. The monastery grew to hold 1000 monks.\nThe complex was totally destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa, began to rebuild it in 1980; he died in 1981.\nFollowing the recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje (born 1985) as the 17th Karmapa by the Tai Situpa, the Dalai Lama and China's governmental offices, he was enthroned at Tsurphu and resided there until he escaped from Tibet to India in 2000.\n\n\n=== Branch monastery ===\nA Yelpa Kagyu monastery, Jang Tana, in Nangchen, Kham, is considered a branch monastery of Tsurpu. It was founded by Yelpa Yeshe Tsek in 1068.\n\n\n=== Variant names ===\nVariant names for the monastery include: Tsurphu, \u695a\u5e03\u5bfa, mtshur mdo bo lung dgon, \u7956\u666e\u5bfa, Okmin Tsurpu, 'og min mtshur phu.\n\n\n== Pilgrims ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nBerzin, Alexander. \"A Brief History of Tsurpu Monastery\".

        "wiki": "Samye (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f66\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f61\u0f66\u0f0b, Wylie: bsam yas, Chinese: \u6851\u8036\u5bfa) is the site of an important gompa (Buddhist monastery) in central Tibet. It is located in the Mchims phu valley, south of Lhasa, next the Hapori mountain, in the Yarlung Valley. The site is in the present administrative region of Gra Nang or Drananga Lhoka. The full name is Bsam yas mi \u2019gyur lhun grub gtsug lag khang, translated by some authors as the \"Temple of Unchanging Spontaneous Presence.\" Samye has a continuous history from eighth century to the present and has played an important part in the history of Tibet and China.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the Blue Annals, completed in 1476, the temple was constructed between 787 and 791 under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen. Earlier in date is the Testament of Ba, the oldest account of the construction of the temple. This records that the foundations were laid in the 'Hare Year'. This corresponds to 763 or 775, with the completion and consecration of the main shrine taking place in the 'Sheep Year'. This is thought to correspond to 779. The plan was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. The arrangement of the temple with a main shrine in the middle with fours shrines of different colours at the cardinal points, and the whole surrounded by a circular wall, represents the Buddhist universe as three dimensional mandala. This idea is found in a number of temples of the period in South East Asia and East Asia such as the T\u014ddai-ji in Japan. As at the T\u014ddai-ji, the Samye temple is dedicated to Vairocana. A seminal text for this cult is the Mahavairocana Tantra, composed in India in the seventh century and translated into Chinese and Tibetan soon after. The history of Samye is dealt with in this section; for the art and architectural features and their history, see below.  \n\nThe Samye pillar or \u0f62\u0fa1\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b and its inscription \nThere are many traditions about Samye compiled after the tenth century. One of the few documents belonging to the eighth century proper--but not carrying an actual date--is an inscription on the stone pillar (\u0f62\u0fa1\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b) preserved in front of the temple. This records the building of temples at Lhasa and Brag Mar (i.e. Samye), and that the king, ministers and other nobles made solemn oaths to preserve and protect the endowments of the monastery. The term used for these endowments is 'necessities' or 'meritorious gifts' (Tib. \u0f61\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f56\u0fb1\u0f51\u0f0b Sanskrit deyadharma).The Samye bell inscription \nA second dynastic record at Samye is on the large bronze bell in the entrance to the temple. This gives an account of the making of the bell by one of the queens of King Trisong Detsen. The text has been translated as follows: \n\"Queen Rgyal mo brtsan, mother and son, made this bell in order to\nworship the Three Jewels of the ten directions. And [they] pray that, by the\npower of that merit, Lha Btsan po Khri Srong lde brtsan, father and son,\nhusband and wife, may be endowed with the harmony of the sixty\nmelodious sounds, and attain supreme enlightenment.\"\nHistories of Samye after the Dynastic Period \nAccording to post-dynastic accounts such as the Testament of Ba and other accounts, such as that compiled by Bsod-nams-rgyal-mtshan (1312-1374), the Indian monk \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita made the first attempt to construct the monastery while promoting his sutra-centric version of Buddhism. Finding the Samye site auspicious, he set about to build a structure there. However, the building would always collapse after reaching a certain stage. Terrified, the construction workers believed that there was a demon or obstructive tulku in a nearby river making trouble.\nWhen Shantarakshita's contemporary Padmasambhava arrived from northern India, he was able to subdue the energetic problems obstructing the building of Samye. According to the 5th Dalai Lama, Padmasambhava performed the Vajrakilaya dance and enacted the rite of namkha to assist Trisong Detsen and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita clear away obscurations and hindrances in the building of Samye: \n\nThe great religious master Padmasambhava performed this dance in order to prepare the ground for the Samye Monastery and to pacify the malice of the lha [local mountain god spirits] and srin [malevolent spirits] in order to create the most perfect conditions.\" He went on to say that after Padmasambhava consecrated the ground he erected a thread-cross \u2014 a web colored thread woven around two sticks \u2014 to catch evil. Then the purifying energy of his dance forced the malevolent spirits into a skull mounted on top of a pyramid of dough. His tantric dance cleared away all the obstacles, enabling the monastery to be built in 767.  The dance was memorialized by the construction of Vajrakilaya stupas \u2014 monuments honoring the ritual kilya (purba) daggers \u2014 at the cardinal points of the monastery, where they would prevent demonic forces from entering the sacred grounds.)\nThe abovementioned quotation makes reference to the relationship of the k\u012bla to the stupa and mentions torma and namkha. Moreover, the building of Samye marked the foundation of the original school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Nyingma. This helps explain how Padmasambhava's Tantra-centric version of Buddhism gained ascendence over the sutra-based teaching of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita.\nPearlman succinctly charts the origin of the institution of the Nechung Oracle:\n\nWhen Padmasambhava consecrated Samye Monastery with the Vajrakilaya dance, he tamed the local spirit protector, Pehar Gyalpo, and bound him by oath to become the head of the entire hierarchy of Buddhist protective spirits.  Pehar, later known as Dorje Drakden, became the principal protector of the Dalai Lamas, manifesting through the Nechung Oracle.\nThe Great Debate\n\nOne of the key events in the history of Samye was the debate between Buddhist schools hosted by Trisong Detsen in the 790s. Adamek (2007: p. 288) provides a circa five-year range when Moheyan of the East Mountain Teaching of Chan Buddhism and Kamala\u015b\u012bla may have debated at Samye in Tibet:As is well known, the fate of Chan in Tibet was said to have been decided in a debate at the Samye monastery.\nBroughton identifies the Chinese and Tibetan nomenclature of Moheyan's teachings and identifies them principally with the East Mountain Teaching:\n\nMo-ho-yen's teaching in Tibet as the famed proponent of the all-at-once gate can be summarized as \"gazing-at-mind\" ([Chinese:] k'an-hsin... [...] [Tibetan:] sems la bltas) and \"no examining\" ([Chinese:] pu-kuan [...] [Tibetan:] myi rtog pa) or \"no-thought no-examining\" ([Chinese:] pu-ssu pu-kuan... [...] [Tibetan:] myi bsam myi rtog). \"Gazing-at-mind\" is an original Northern (or East Mountain Dharma Gate) teaching. As will become clear, Poa-t'ang and the Northern Ch'an dovetail in the Tibetan sources. Mo-ho-yen's teaching seems typical of late Northern Ch'an. Mo-ho-yen arrived on the central Tibetan scene somewhat late in comparison to the Ch'an transmissions from Szechwan.\nThe great debate of the Council of Lhasa between the two principal debators or dialecticians, Moheyan and Kamala\u015b\u012bla is narrated and depicted in a specific cham dance once held annually at Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nThe 18th century Puning Temple built by the Qianlong Emperor of Qing China in Chengde, Hebei was modeled after Samye.\n\n\n== Architectural features of the monastery and their history ==\nSamye Monastery is laid out on the shape of a giant mandala, with the main temple representing the legendary Mount Meru in the centre. Other buildings stand at the corners and cardinal points of the main temple, representing continents and other features of tantric Buddhist cosmology.\nIn corners are 4 ch\u00f6rtens - white, red, green (or blue) and black.\nThere are 8 main temples:\n\nDajor ling \u0f56\u0f62\u0fa1\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa6\u0fb1\u0f7c\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (brda sbyor gling)\nDragyar ling \u0f66\u0f92\u0fb2\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f66\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (sgra bsgyar gling)\nB\u00e9tsa ling \u0f56\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f59\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (be tsa gling)\nJampa ling \u0f56\u0fb1\u0f58\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (byams pa gling)\nSamten ling \u0f56\u0f66\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f4f\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (bsam gtan gling)\nNatsok ling \u0f66\u0fa3\u0f0b\u0f5a\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (sna tshogs gling)\nD\u00fcd\u00fcl ling \u0f56\u0f51\u0f74\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f51\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (bdud 'dul gling)\nTamdrin ling \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f42\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f42\u0fb3\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b (rta mgrin gling)\nThe original buildings have long disappeared. They have been badly damaged several times \u2014 by civil war in the 11th century, fires in the mid 17th century and in 1826, an earthquake in 1816, and in the 20th century, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. As late as the late 1980s pigs and other farm animals were allowed to wander through the sacred buildings. Heinrich Harrer quoted his own words he said to the 14th Dalai Lama of what he saw in 1982 from his airplane en route to Lhasa, \"On our approach, in the Brahmaputra valley, the first terrible sight we saw confirmed all the bad news about Tibet's oldest monastery, Samye; it was totally destroyed. One can still make out the outer wall, but none of the temples or stupas survives.\" Each time it has been rebuilt, and today, largely due to the efforts of Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama from 1986 onward, it is again an active monastery and important pilgrimage and tourist destination.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCham dance\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDorje, Gyurme.

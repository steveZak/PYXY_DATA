        "wiki": "Carrefour (Haitian Creole: Kafou; pronounced [kafu]) is a largely residential commune in the Port-au-Prince Arrondissement, in the Ouest department of Haiti. The commune had a population of 373,916 at the 2003 census, and was officially estimated to have grown to 511,345 inhabitants in 2015. It is mostly a bedroom community for those who work in central Port-au-Prince.\nBefore the exile of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Carrefour was viewed as a Haitian tourist destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nCarrefour was originally a military post in the borough of Port-au-Prince. In March 1795, Louis-Jacques Beauvais and Andr\u00e9 Rigaud, at the head of 3,000 men, routed the English troops occupying the republican port.\nPresident Alexandre Petion, one of the founding fathers of the Haitian homeland, built his private residence in Carrefour, especially in the locality that is still known as Thor. The National School of Thor has been housed in this very house for several decades.\nOn 1 May 1813, a decree of President Alexandre P\u00e9tion founded the village of Carrefour. Following a plan drawn up by surveyor Louis Rigaud, the village was to have 20 islets and 161 sites.\nIn 1869, the Cacos, in rebellion against the government of Sylvain Salnave, occupied Carrefour and attacked the fort of Bizoton without being able to settle there. Indeed, while they were indulging in the delights of the region, Salnave lifted the Piquets of the South, who attacked them from behind and forced them to evacuate the military post. About twenty years later, more precisely on 20 August 1889, at the height of the insurrection of the northerners against President L\u00e9gitime, the vanguard of the Army of the South came to take up a position at Carrefour. The day after (21 August), the day before Legitime's departure, General Justin Carrie fought two battles and was repulsed at Bizoton.\nIn one of his development projects, President Fran\u00e7ois Denys L\u00e9gitime planned to link Carrefour to Port-au-Prince by a line of steamboats along the coast to Leogane.\nCarrefour was elevated to the rank of commune by the decree of 15 December 1982.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe commune of Carrefour is the crossroads through which must pass thousands of cars, vans and trucks to go in a good part of the department of the west, in the departments of the Southeast, the Nippes, the South and the Grande \u2013 Anse. Because of its geographical location and its natural environment, the urban and rural areas of the commune of Carrefour have economic and tourist potentialities.The commune of Carrefour, commonly called \"kafou\" by its nationals, was originally a small village founded by the decree of President Petion the 1st. May 1813. According to the plots of the surveyor Louis Rigaud, this village comprised seven streets, 20 islets and 162 sites.\nFor more than a century and a half, Carrefour has never been urbanized as its founders wished. Its agricultural vocation took precedence over its urbanization. The original settlement provided the surrounding settlements (Monrepos, Lamentin, Mahoti\u00e8re, Thor, Brochette, Mariani) and the various communal sections supplied the villagers of Carrefour and the town of Port-au-Prince with agricultural products such as rice, cane Sugar, cotton, fruit, vegetables, food, coffee, & c. It was not until the mid-1970s that the anarchic urbanization of the area began. This \"urbanization\" coincides with the liquidation of the main houses by the large landowners of Carrefour.\nOn 15 December 1982, 169 years after its founding, the village of Carrefour, which became the neighborhood of Carrefour, was elevated to the rank of commune by the decree of 15 December 1982. Carrefour forms with Port-au-Prince, Petion -Ville, Kenscoff, Gressier and Delmas, the borough of Port-au-Prince. The rural area, which is fairly extensive, comprises the following 13 communal sections: Bizoton, Thor, Froide River, Corail Thor, Morne-\u00e0-Chandelle, Platon Dufresney, Taillefer, Procy, Bouvier, Coupeau, Laval, Berly and Malanga.\nThe topography of Carrefour is not quite different from that of Port-au-Prince. Like the latter, the municipality of Carrefour rises to the bottom of the Gulf of Gonave. It includes a mountainous part including the hills Malanga, Chandelle, Boyer, Froide River, Dufr\u00e9n\u00e9, Corail Thor.\nIts geographical limits extend from the east to the north, from the junction of Fontamara 43 with the coastline until it meets Port-au-Prince Bay and along this coast until its meeting with The ravine of Mariani. From the northwest, they turn south to the limit of the 12th Section of Morne-\u00e0-Bateau, the 23rd Section of the Parks and the 8th Section of Beau-S\u00e9jour de la as of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne. From there, they rejoin the boundaries of the 7th Section, Great River, 4th Section, Gosseline which belongs to the commune of Jacmel, and the 2 nd Section, Nouvelle-Tourraine and the 20 th Section, Bongars, Of the commune of Kenscoff. They again rejoin Fontamara 43 by the South-South-East trajectory of the 8th Section, Martissant, of the commune of Port-au-Prince. The coordinates of the municipality are located on the one hand between 72 \u00b0 22 'and 72 \u00b0 27 west longitude and on the other hand between 18 \u00b0 30' and 18 \u00b0 35 'north latitude. Its area is estimated at 190 km\u00b2.\nAs far as hydrography is concerned, the Froide River, one of the most important watercourses in the municipality, flows through Communal Sections of Plato Dufresney and continues to the Pond Section of the commune Of Petion-Ville. Then the river of Chauffard which irrigates the houses of the communal section Procy, that of Bengas at the level of Kenscoff and that of Momance or Grande-Rivi\u00e8re, between the communal sections of Procy and Laval. Among the less important rivers The Grandin River, the Morel and Time-Perdu gullies.\nOn the demographic level, the commune of Carrefour has a population of more than 500,000 (five hundred thousand) inhabitants. However, it remains extremely difficult to have more or less reliable statics on the population of Carrefour. According to the 1982 census, Carrefour had a population of 129 470 people; The 2003 census has a population of 373,916 inhabitants. Based on 4.24, the annual growth rate of its population, today, Carrefour would have a population of 460 251 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== List of communal sections of Carrefour ===\nThe communal section (French: section communale, formerly section rurale) is the smallest administrative division in Haiti.\n\nPostal Code of Carrefour :\n\nHT6130 : Carrefour\nHT6131 : Bizoton\nHT6132 : Diquini, Thor\nHT6133 : C\u00f4te-Page, Mahoti\u00e8re\nHT6134 : Arcachon, Warney\nHT6135 : Brochette\nHT6136 : Lamentin, Mariani, Merger\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Carrefour is one of the largest municipalities in the Republic of Haiti if its size and population are taken into account. It comprises 13 communal sections. Its urban center is subdivided into zones or districts: part of Fontamara, Bizoton, Diquini, Thor, Mahoti\u00e8re, C\u00f4te-Plage, Waney, Arcachon, Monrepos, Brochette, Lamentin, Rivi\u00e8re Froide, part of Mariani. Some of these neighborhoods have more than 10000 inhabitants.\nMost of the territory of the municipality of Carrefour is concentrated in its mountainous municipal sections. The lack of improved roads makes access by car or truck difficult; In most cases, the use of vehicles in these environments is completely impossible. With a population of more than 500,000 inhabitants, human pressure on the environment is growing.\nWhen it comes to the relationship between urban and rural areas, Carrefour is no exception to the rule. Generally, in all municipalities of Haiti, the urban center commonly called \"bouk or lavil\" depends on their communal sections \u2013 most often located in the mountainous areas \u2013 for their food and drinking water supply. Despite this dependence, the communal sections are still treated as the country outside. When at the town hall, the only time a resident of a communal section will hear about the town hall is before the municipal elections. Although the so-called urban dwellers live on resources from rural areas, it has never occurred to them that these resources are inexhaustible. Their contempt for the rural environment and the concentration of services in the urban area have contributed to the abandonment of the countryside: the rural exodus.\nIt is the exploitation of quarries and extensive agriculture that pose a problem: they have an important social role because they employ thousands of people, but these activities cause the destruction of the environments. Operation accelerates water runoff, sediment accumulation and soil erosion. Farmers find themselves obliged to cultivate steeper land and make charcoal with the vegetation cover. The degradation of the environment is thus explained by a spatial inorganization. Some associations advocate more efficient development and campaign for clean-up or reconstruction.\nForest cover in Haiti is currently less than 3%. The depletion of water sources across the country is a direct result of deforestation. Until the second half of the 1980s, the Carrefour hills were largely covered with fruit and forest trees. As for the Froide River, its water was still crystalline. Thousands of people were still bathing there daily. In addition, every day, hundreds of women relied on this river to earn money after washing for customers who were always loyal to the appointment.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nUnlike the majority of municipalities in the Republic of Haiti, agriculture occupies a very small place in Carrefour's economy. The commune of Carrefour occupies remains an appendix of Port-au-Prince. The secondary and tertiary sectors primarily supply its economic circuit. Nevertheless, agricultural activities are undertaken in the communal sections of Morne Chandelle, Plateau Dufresney, Taillefer, Procy, Coupeau, Laval, Bouvier and Malanga.\nThe inhabitants of all the communal sections of Carrefour depend mainly on agriculture; Coffee, vegetables, cereals, food and cane-sugar are grown there. There are also cattle (oxen, cabris, backyard birds on a very small scale), with the exception of coffee, an imported commodity grown on the hills of Rivi\u00e8re Froide, Dufresney and Corail Thor, The farmers of the communal sections of Carrefour only practice subsistence farming, in other words, their agricultural production does not have a significant impact on the economy of the commune, and the urban area where the majority Of the population, the economy works like the big Haitian cities, or even better.\nOn the other hand, in the urban center of Carrefour are concentrated on the one hand the main public services: the tribunal of peace, the Taxation Department, the police station, the registry office, the Coast Guard, The largest sports complex in the country. In addition, commercial activities: banks, supermarkets, bazaars, bakeries, public market, shops, pharmacies, etc. Industrial establishments such as paint factories, Haiti Metal, Mariani Tannery, Cuir SA, Adventist Packaging, SAFICO, ALTA and TOLI, STEP-OVER and oil companies (the National, Shell, Texaco, ESSO).\nTwo hospitals and numerous private clinics provide health care at the level of the commune of Carrefour: Diquini Adventist Hospital and Carrefour Hopital Maternit\u00e9. Despite the presence of these hospitals, many Carrefourrois still continue to visit the hospitals and clinics located in the city of Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n== Education ==\nA large number of public and private schools provide education at primary, secondary, vocational and university levels. In the last twenty years, due to the rural exodus to the center and the growing demand for education, primary and secondary schools have multiplied in Carrefour. Despite the presence of very good institutions in Carrefour, thousands of adolescents residing in the commune still continue to attend the schools located in Port-au-Prince.\nList of Schools in Carrefour\n\nEnsemble Scolaire P\u00e8re Basile Moreau (ESPBM)\nJuv\u00e9nat du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur\nLyc\u00e9e Louis Joseph Janvier\nColl\u00e8ge Univers Fr\u00e8re Rapha\u00ebl\nColl\u00e8ge de C\u00f4te-Plage\nL'Ecole des S\u0153urs Sal\u00e9siennes\nL'\u00c9cole Notre Dame de l'Assomption\nL'\u00c9cole Nationale de Thor\nColl\u00e8ge Catherine Flon\nCentre d'\u00c9tudes Secondaires\nCentre Polyvalent\nColl\u00e8ge Paul Etzer\nL'\u00c9cole R\u00e9publique du Centre Afrique\nLe Lyc\u00e9e de Diquini\nColl\u00e8ge de Radio Lumi\u00e8re\nColl\u00e8ge Adventiste de Diquini\nL'Universit\u00e9 Adventiste\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nIn the 1970s and into the second half of the 1980s, Carrefour occupied a prominent position in tourism in Haiti. It was for Haitian and foreign tourists a favorite destination. However, after the collapse of the Duvalier regime and the ensuing instability, the tourist industry completely collapsed.\nWhat is to be emphasized is the general idea of the urban areas of the commune of Carrefour. In the eyes of more than one, Carrefour represents above all a state of mind, a way of life. Its agglomerations and its many streets and alleys are characterized by great animation, exuberant joy, a deconcentrated and non-conformist way of living.\nUntil the end of the 80s, there was in the city of Carrefour a pleiade of night clubs commonly called \"Bo\u00eete de Nui.\" These leisure centers (Hotel- Bars-Restaurant) were swarming in the urban center of Carrefour. The Spanish consonance of some of these centers testifies to the presence and influence of a large Dominican in the municipality. These include: Copa Cabana, El Baraquito, Rancho Cocktail, Corso Disco Club, Poco a Poco Bar, Mi Casa Hotel-Bar-Restaurant, Madruga Disco-Restaurant-Hotel, etc.\nOther attractions in the area include M\u00e9ridien Club, Paradis des Amis Restaurant-Hotel, Paladium Night Club, Downtown Disco Club, Mermaid Beach Hotel, Etoile de David Bar-Restaurant, Auberge du Qu\u00e9bec, Chez Nounoune, Bamboulinos Hotel. But the most famous of these centers, either because of the luxury they offer or the musical groups that animated them, were the Lambi Night Club, the Domaine Ideal (whose clientele was mainly foreign), the Tiboukan Auberge Restaurant, the Three Fish and Chez Cator famous for its \"pwason gwo s\u00e8l.\" Most of these establishments built on the seashore all enjoyed a very caressing breeze through the seasons.\nOn the other hand, the entertainment was enriched by the various cinemas: the Coliseum, Cric Crac Cine, Crystal Cine. There was also the cockfighting, especially at the Amical Gaguere de Mariani. As for the communal sections, the gargoyles hold the top of the bill.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nReligious activities are multifaceted. It is a true syncretism Catholics, vodouisants, Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses and adepts of various confessions compete with fervor. The churches dedicated to Saint Charles and Our Lady of Mount Carmel bring together an immense crowd of faithful from the surrounding districts and Port-au-Prince on the occasion of the patron festivals of 4 November and 16 July. As for the chapel of Saint Anthony, it is a permanent center of interest. Placed at the top of Merger, it never ceases to drain pilgrims. Other chapels exist in the communal sections.\nThe Protestant churches are found everywhere in the commune of Carrefour. Very often, late in the night, the quarters vibrate with their prayers and their songs of adoration. This establishes a very clear contrast with the dance music of night clubs or nightclubs. On the other hand, there are also the houmforts where the followers of the voodoo pay homage to the African gods, the loas. In this religious atmosphere, certain signs will never cease to astonish an observer: \"God alone inspires us and science enlightens us: Botanica Sciencia de San Juan Templa.\" Macoumba.\nWhat is particularly pleasing to point out are the social works undertaken by the different religious denominations. Outside the impressive schools, some have orphanages, canteens, places of retreat, and so on.\nOn 10 December 1905, the parish of Carrefour was erected by Mgr. Conan, two years after his elevation as Archbishop of Port-au-Prince. Carrefour was a small chapel in the parish of Sainte Anne, dedicated to Saint Charles of Borome. The first parish priest was R. P. Lebihain. Then, the Monfortains took possession of the Parish of Carrefour. A contract had been signed between the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince and the company of Mary (Monfortains) supported by Rome.\nOn 20 February 1910, Paul Marie Lebihain was appointed parish priest of Port-de-Paix and Vicar General of the Society of Mary, replaced by Father Brochard (1910\u20131947), RP Doriel (1947\u20131972) and Father Eustache Saint Hubert (1972\u2013), etc.\nThe Monfortian monks built the presbytery, the church, a parish hall, chapels in the communal sections all by Fathers Dorel and Saint Hubert\nThe Parish of Carrefour has eight chapels scattered in the communal sections: Morne-a-Bateau, dedicated to Saint Antoine; Great River, Saint Paul; Morne-\u00e0-Chandelle, Saint Michel; Boucan Marie, Our Lady of the Annunciation; Bouvier, Holy Heart of Mary; Coupeau, Our Lady of Lourdes; Wiailles, Saint Francis Xavier; C\u00f4te-Plages, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.\nIn addition, under the administration of Father Dor\u00e9lien, several religious communities settled in the Parish of Carrefour: the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, the Salesian Sisters, the Little Sisters of Saint Teresa, the Little Brothers of Saint Teresa, the Girls Of Wisdom and the Oblate Missionaries.\n\n\n== Gouvernements and Politics ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCarrefour has a municipal council (conseil municipal) compound of three members elected by the inhabitants of the commune for a 4-year term. The municipal council is led by a president often called mayor.\nCarrefour has a municipal assembly (assembl\u00e9e municipale) who assists the council in its work.\nThe members of the assembly are also elected for 4 years.\nMunicipal Councils (2016\u20132020)\n\nJude Edouard Pierre (Mayor)\nMaxo Bourdeau\nDarlyne JosephMunicipal Assembly (2016\u20132020)\n\n\n== 2010 earthquake ==\nOn 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti caused heavy damage to residential buildings in Carrefour, with 40 to 50 per cent of buildings destroyed in the town's worst-affected areas. One of the damaged facilities was the city's hospital.In the wake of the quake, the Cuban military set up a field hospital in the region. Electricity was restored to some sectors at the beginning of February.As of 9 February 2010, the US 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is rotating out of Haiti, having been replaced by the US 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, in their position on USS Bataan and Carrefour, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Grand-Go\u00e2ve and Petit-Go\u00e2ve.As of 7 March 2010, a donated Fujifilm X-ray machine has arrived at the Adventists Medical Center.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity Hall of Carrefour, Website of the City Hall of Carrefour, Haiti\nReuters, \"Comprehensive Building Damage Assessment for Carrefour Commune, Haiti (Version 3)\", 15 February 2010\nReuters, \"Intensity of Building Damages in Central Carrefour, Haiti\", 25 February 2010",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption (French: Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de L'Assomption), often called Port-au-Prince Cathedral (French: Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince), was a cathedral in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  Built between 1884 and 1914, it was dedicated on December 13, 1928 (1928-12-13), and became the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince. The cathedral was destroyed in the 12 January 2010 earthquake.\nBefore its destruction, the cupola of the north tower of the Cathedral served as the front lighthouse of a pair guiding mariners into Port-au-Prince harbor.\n\n\n== Destruction ==\nThe roof and the towers flanking the main entrance collapsed in the 12 January 2010 earthquake, although the lower parts of the walls remain standing.  The earthquake also destroyed the nunciature and the archdiocesan offices, killing Archbishop Joseph Serge Miot instantly and Vicar General Charles Benoit later.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Reconstruction ==\nIn March 2012, the Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince, in collaboration with Faith & Form magazine and the Institute for the Safeguarding of National Heritage (ISPAN), a Haitian-government institution, launched an international design competition inviting the architects from all over the world to submit ideas that would inform the reconstruction of the cathedral. \nPuerto Rican architect Segundo Cardona, FAIA from SCF Architects won the competition. He proposed to integrate and frame the facade of the old building, which survived the earthquake, with two new concrete towers, while the old nave, whose pillars also partially survived, will be transformed into a covered courtyard. The religious ceremonies will take place at the level of the current transept under a vast room surmounted by a dome, underneath which will be the altar. The new design allows for a capacity of 1,200 faithful (capacity which can be raised to 600 additional persons thanks to the use of the covered yard). The interior of the new cathedral will be marked by the creative and abundant use of natural light, as the supply of electricity in Port-au-Prince is intermittent and expensive.\n\"The winning design \u2014 [is] a modern interpretation of the traditional architecture of a cathedral [...]. Cardona\u2019s other significant works include the Coliseum of San Juan and the Puerto Rico Pavilion built for the 1992 World Expo in Seville, Spain.\"In 2020 the building is still in ruins.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cathedrals in Haiti\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVander Brug, Brian. \"Panorama: Destruction at Notre Dame Cathedral of Port-au-Prince (Click and drag within the image to navigate.

          "The Notre Dame Cathedral is the main attraction in Cap Hatien. The architecture is colonial from the times of French occupation. The building is painted white with peach columns and yellow border highlights. The portico over the main double door entrance has a coat of arms on",
          "It was under construction when I went but still work making your rounds past. The park area is still full of people just hanging out and it\u2019s a very nice space",
          "Sadly we were unable to see the interior as the entire building is closed off to the public as the reconstruction is taking place. However the children in the adjoining square were all anxious to practice their English and have pictures taken with them.",
          "Catherdrale Notre Dame is a charming historic building, at the moment is being renovated so it's impossible to visit. It stands in a historic green square (there are only few in town) in the very center. It's nice to look at the church from the benches surrounded by palm trees.",
          "Notre Dame of Cap Haitien has been the religious heart of the city for many generations of Catholic Christians. The interior includes interesting statues and paintings.",
          "It is,i think,the heart of the town.I've been here just for a while to pay visit and take photo for its architecture.Also lies here in is their plaza,just in the front,where many locals gather around.If you want some local street foods,you will find plenty of them here.",
          "Beautiful landmark they have a park right on the same property lots of trees and sitting area go Sunday morning so you can go inside the church it's beautiful.",
          "The best part of the cathedral is the dome, seen from the outside. Its facade is rather stark and so is the interior. However, the plaza in front of the cathedral seems to be the center of the city with some governmental buildings around. Definitely pay a visit, but don't",
          "Beautiful, historical but needs some painting. They have a park in front of the church for kids to play and study.",
          "was renovated in the late 80s-early 90s, due for a freshening again. worth a short visit, the park in front has been redone since I was last there and is very nice, again, not an all day thing, but worth a visit.",
          "The cathedral is the central attraction in the colonial part of Cap Haitien, but walk around the area near it if you like old architecture with brightly painted shutters, clean streets and friendly people just sitting about.",
          "There was a marriage about to start so we didn't had the chance to enter. The place was nice but needed a little more renovation, but we heard that the inside was really nice.",
          "It is a pretty classic town square in an old colonial city. The church itself is beautiful and with the mountains in the background is quite picturesque. The square in front is much more lively at night but the surrounding area is definitely not for the non-streetwise and you",
          "Not sure weather you can get outside but the outside was well kept. I really enjoyed the square right across the Cathedral. Lots of local and it's very peaceful",
          "My hotel was a few blocks away. I strolled the square and by the historic church in the early evening. Enjoyed church bells, school children romping about in their uniforms, and locals discussing the days happenings. A peaceful and atmospheric stroll through colorful Cap Haitien.",
          "Located next to a nice public square seeing this cathedral from there was enough for me. When I visited it was closed and from a close up inspection I could see that some areas are in need of repairs. I would not go out of my way to visit but the area seems nice enough to walk",
          "Our family attended mass and it was a highlight of our trip to Cap-Haitien. The people are so friendly, the church clean, with fans and everything you'd hope for in a mass!",
          "We drove to and then around this Cathedral and saw nothing unique or spectacular about it. There isn't much to see in the city itself, so I guess this would be the highlight (lowlight).",
          "We were able to secure a private viewing of the cathedral when we arrived by asking even though it was closed to the public",
          "Cap Haitien holds up to 70% of the history of Haiti. We had an awesome time last week touring Cap haitien. We visited the Cathedral and place d'armes, the museum of bill, the monuments of vertieres (where the last battle for independence occurred), the yard and cave of Bois",
          "Fantastic to see Mass in Cap, close to Xmas day too. Many were in their Sunday best and the singing was beautful.",
          "This is just a nice building. I feel that although restored, this is Cathedral is listed as another thing for Cap Haitian. What should be listed is all of the streets and the people, and the food. Nice building, but people watching in the square is more exciting.",
          "There is a lot of history behind this church if you care to go there. same old catholic furniture in there",
          "I realise that Haiti does not really have a tourist trade, and at present, very little infrastructure...but it still astounds me that there are only 2 sites to review. you can review the old town of cartegena, Havana, prague, even Edinburgh....but you cant review the old town in",
          "A shady place for locals to sit to keep out of the fierce sun. The church was closed, however our driver mamaged to het us in the side door. It was lovely as young girls were rehearsing for some event and so we happily sat and watched. The choir was rehearsing as well in a side",
          "Proud and beautiful church in the historic center. See the picturesque square and elegant buildings around",
          "There was a service taking place when we had a short visit. Inside the cathedral is very roomy and we enjoyed the singing and having a quick look around. Outside is impressive too as the cathedral looks over the town square",

          "I was able to visit the cathedral in May of 2015 because it was next to the hotel that I stay at in Cap Haitian. When I went there they were celebrating a mass and had the chance to worship, pray and participate in the service. It is a very beautiful structure right in the",
          "The Cathedrale is by far the most impressive structure in Cap. Surrounded by huts, shacks and humble structures in all directions the church stands out like no other building. For the contrast alone it should be seen. Try to view from the hillsides to get a better",
          "It is located in Cap Haitien, never realized that there was a place like this in Haiti, a 19th century style colonial town, old ginger bread houses that still stood after 100 years plus ago, a town that has a rich history of its people, It was the first capital of Cap Haitien",
          "We were not able to enter since church service was in session and we were not dressed for it. The grounds and building was beautiful",
          "The Cathedrale is quite beautiful--it's a large, high-ceiling building with beautiful windows and individual mausoleums inside. Note that as of January, 2015, extensive construction was ongoing. We were still able to have a very pleasant visit, however.",

          "For a Cathedral it is nothing special, but for Cap H, where most buildings are shacks, it is pretty nice.",
          "The cathedral is gorgeous! So historic and architecturally stunning! My cousin, Pere Yvon's funeral was celebrated there and it was just an amazing experience.",
          "This is one of the most stunning churches I've seen, and although we've just driven past and didn't get a chance to go inside, the massive sparkling white building has stood for centuries and is rightly a source of great pride throughout Haiti.",
          "The enormous Cathedral is an impressive sight indeed although the interior is rather simple . Nevertheless is a good point to start exploring the city as it is visible from many streets . All around are old colonial mansions and interesting people. Recomended area.",
          "I had the opportunity recently to visit the Cathedral Notre Dame de Cap Haitien on a Sunday during mass. It is a pretty place, simple and serene. The reason I gave it an excellent rating...the choral singing was so beautiful, so moving. In all my almost 59 years on this",

          "The city of Cap-Haitien, like the rest of Haiti, is rough and not for the lighthearted. That said, the old colonial center is a huge break from the hustle-and-bustle of the rest of the city. Every single street in the central city is lined with brilliantly preserved French"

        "wiki": "Port-au-Prince (, French: [p\u0254\u0281 o p\u0281\u025b\u0303s]; Haitian Creole: P\u00f2toprens [p\u0254top\u0263\u025b\u0303s]) is the capital and most populous city of Haiti. The city's population was estimated at 987,310 in 2015 with the metropolitan area estimated at a population of 2,618,894.  The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince, Delmas, Cite Soleil, Tabarre, Carrefour, and P\u00e9tion-Ville.\nThe city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve: the bay on which the city lies, which acts as a natural harbor, has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Arawaks. It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city's layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area's population at around 3.7 million, nearly half of the country's national population. The city was catastrophically affected by a devastating earthquake in 2010, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti's government estimated the death toll to be 230,000.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPort-au-Prince literally means \"Port of the Prince\", but it is unclear which prince was the honoree. \nA theory is that the place is named after Le Prince, a ship captained by de Saint-Andr\u00e9 which arrived in the area in 1706. \nHowever, the islets in the bay had already been known as les \u00eelets du Prince as early as 1680, predating the ship's arrival. \nFurthermore, the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H\u00f4pital, named after the filibusters' hospital.French colonial commissioner \u00c9tienne Polverel named the city Port-R\u00e9publicain on 23 September 1793 \"in order that the inhabitants be kept continually in mind of the obligations which the French Revolution imposed on them.\" It was later renamed back to Port-au-Prince by Jacques I, Emperor of Haiti.When Haiti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south, Port-au-Prince was the capital of the republic, under the leadership of Alexandre P\u00e9tion. Henri Christophe renamed the city Port-aux-Crimes after the assassination of Jacques I at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge, and located north of the city).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish colonization ===\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the island of Hispaniola was inhabited by people known as the Ta\u00edno, who arrived in approximately 2600 BC in large dugout canoes. They are believed to come primarily from what is now eastern Venezuela. By the time Columbus arrived in 1492 AD, the region was under the control of Bohechio, Ta\u00edno cacique (chief) Xaragua. He, like his predecessors, feared settling too close to the coast; such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the Caribes, who lived on neighboring islands. Instead, the region served as a hunting ground. The population of the region was approximately 400,000 at the time, but the Ta\u00ednos were gone within 30 years of the arrival of the Spaniards.With the arrival of the Spaniards, the Amerindians were forced to accept a protectorate, and Bohechio, childless at death, was succeeded by his sister, Anacaona, wife of the cacique Caonabo. The Spanish insisted on larger tributes. Eventually, the Spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly, and in 1503, Nicolas Ovando, then governor, set about to put an end to the r\u00e9gime headed by Anacaona. He invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast, and when the Amerindians had drunk a good deal of wine (the Spaniards did not drink on that occasion), he ordered most of the guests killed. Anacaona was spared, only to be hanged publicly some time later. Through violence and murders, the Spanish settlers decimated the native population.\nDirect Spanish rule over the area having been established, Ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast (west of Etang Saum\u00e2tre), ironically named Santa Maria de la Paz Verdadera, which would be abandoned several years later. Not long thereafter, Ovando founded Santa Maria del Puerto. The latter was first burned by French explorers in 1535, then again in 1592 by the English. These assaults proved to be too much for the Spanish colonial administration, and in 1606, it decided to abandon the region.\n\n\n=== Domination of the flibustiers ===\nFor more than 50 years, the area that is today Port-au-Prince saw its population drop off drastically, when some buccaneers began to use it as a base, and Dutch merchants began to frequent it in search of leather, as game was abundant there. Around 1650, French flibustiers, running out of room on the \u00cele de la Tortue began to arrive on the coast, and established a colony at Trou-Borded. As the colony grew, they set up a hospital not far from the coast, on the Turgeau heights. This led to the region being known as H\u00f4pital.\nAlthough there had been no real Spanish presence in H\u00f4pital for well over 50 years, Spain retained its formal claim to the territory, and the growing presence of the French flibustiers on ostensibly Spanish lands provoked the Spanish crown to dispatch Castilian soldiers to H\u00f4pital to retake it. The mission proved to be a disaster for the Spanish, as they were outnumbered and outgunned, and in 1697, the Spanish government signed the Treaty of Ryswick, renouncing any claims to H\u00f4pital. Around this time, the French also established bases at Ester (part of Petite Rivi\u00e8re) and Gona\u00efves.\nEster was a rich village, inhabited by merchants, and equipped with straight streets; it was here that the governor lived. On the other hand, the surrounding region, Petite-Rivi\u00e8re, was quite poor. Following a great fire in 1711, Ester was abandoned. Yet the French presence in the region continued to grow, and soon afterward, a new city was founded to the south, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.\n\nWhile the first French presence in H\u00f4pital, the region later to contain Port-au-Prince was that of the flibustiers; as the region became a real French colony, the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates. While useful in repelling Englishmen intent on encroaching upon French territory, they were relatively independent, unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration, and a potential threat to it. Therefore, in the winter of 1707, Choiseul-Beaupr\u00e9, the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat. He insisted upon control of the hospital, but the flibustiers refused, considering that humiliating. They proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor, and many of them became habitans (farmers) the first long-term European inhabitants in the region.\nAlthough the elimination of the flibustiers as a group from H\u00f4pital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration, it also made the region a more attractive target for the English. In order to protect the area, in 1706, a captain named de Saint-Andr\u00e9 sailed into the bay just below the hospital, in a ship named Le Prince. It is said that M. de Saint-Andr\u00e9 named the area Port-au-Prince (meaning \"Port of the Prince\"), but the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H\u00f4pital, but the islets in the bay had already been known as les \u00eelets du Prince as early as 1680.\nThe English did not trouble the area, and various nobles sought land grants from the French crown in H\u00f4pital; the first noble to control H\u00f4pital was Sieur Joseph Randot. Upon his death in 1737, Sieur Pierre Morel gained control over part of the region, with Gatien Bretton des Chapelles acquiring another portion of it.\nBy then, the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen, in order to better control the French portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). For a time, Petit-Go\u00e2ve and L\u00e9og\u00e2ne vied for this honor, but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons. Neither was centrally located. Petit-Go\u00e2ve's climate caused it to be too malarial, and L\u00e9ogane's topography made it difficult to defend. Thus, in 1749, a new city was built, Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Port-au-Prince ===\n\nIn 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (the modern Cap-Ha\u00eftien) as capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue.In November 1791, it was burned in a battle between attacking black revolutionists and defending white plantation owners.It was captured by British troops on June 4, 1794.In 1804, it became the capital of newly independent Ha\u00efti. When Jean-Jacques Dessalines was assassinated in 1806, Port-au-Prince became the capital of the mulatto-dominated south (Cap-Ha\u00eftien was the capital of the black-dominated north). It was re-established as the capital of all of Haiti when the country was unified again in 1820.\n\n\n=== American occupation ===\nDuring the American occupation of Haiti (1915\u20131934), Port-au-Prince, garrisoned by American Marines and Haitian gendarmes, was attacked twice by caco rebels. The first battle, which took place in 1919, was a victory of the American and Haitian government forces, as was the second attack in 1920.\n\n\n=== 2010 earthquake ===\n\nOn 12 January 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, devastating the city. Most of the central historic area of the city was destroyed, including Haiti's prized Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince, the capital building, Legislative Palace (the parliament building), Palace of Justice (Supreme Court building), several ministerial buildings, and at least one hospital. The second floor of the Presidential Palace was thrown into the first floor, and the domes skewed at a severe tilt. The seaport and airport were both damaged, limiting aid shipments. The seaport was severely damaged by the quake and was unable to accept aid shipments for the first week.\nThe airport's control tower was damaged and the US military had to set up a new control center with generators to get the airport prepared for aid flights. Aid has been delivered to Port-au-Prince by numerous nations and voluntary groups as part of a global relief effort. On Wednesday, January 20, 2010, an aftershock rated at a magnitude of 5.9 caused additional damage.\n\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\n\nThe worst hurricane season experienced by Haiti occurred in 2008 when four storms Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike negatively impacted Haiti. Nearly 800 people were killed; 22,000 homes were destroyed; 70% of the country's crops were lost, according to reliefweb.org.  Then, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, while not making direct impact, resulted in 75 deaths, $250 million in damage and a resurgence of cholera that was estimated to infected 5,000 people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe metropolitan area is subdivided into various communes (districts). There is a ring of districts that radiates out from the commune of Port-au-Prince. P\u00e9tion-Ville is an affluent suburban commune located southeast of the city. Delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city, and the rather poor commune of Carrefour is located southwest of the city.\nThe commune harbors many low-income slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, is situated.  However, Cit\u00e9 Soleil has been recently split off from Port-au-Prince proper to form a separate commune. The Champ de Mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently.  The downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPort-au-Prince has a tropical wet and dry climate and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Port-au-Prince's wet season runs from March through November, though the city experiences a relative break in rainfall during the month of July. The city's dry season covers the remaining three months.  Port-au-Prince generally experiences warm and humid conditions during the dry season and hot and humid conditions during the wet season.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the area was 1,234,742.\nThe majority of the population is of African descent, but a prominent biracial minority controls many of the city's businesses. There are sizable numbers of Hispanic residents, Asians, as well as a number of Europeans (both foreign born and native born).\nCitizens of Arab (particularly Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian) ancestry are a minority with a presence in the capital. Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in Port-au-Prince) are, more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. Most of the biracial residents of the city are concentrated within wealthier areas.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPort-au-Prince is one of the nation's largest centers of economy and finance. The capital exports its most widely consumed produce of coffee and sugar, and has, in the past, exported other goods, such as shoes and baseballs. Port-au-Prince has food-processing plants as well as soap, textile and cement factories. Despite political unrest, the city also relies on the tourism industry and construction companies to move its economy. Port-au-Prince was once a popular place for cruises, but has lost nearly all of its tourism, and no longer has cruise ships coming into port.\nUnemployment in Port-au-Prince is high, and compounded further by underemployment. Levels of economic activity remain prominent throughout the city, especially among people selling goods and services on the streets. Informal employment is believed to be widespread in Port-au-Prince's slums, as otherwise the population could not survive. Port-au-Prince has several upscale districts in which crime rates are significantly lower than in the city center.Port-au-Prince has a tourism industry. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport (referred to often as the Port-au-Prince International Airport) is the country's main international gateway for tourists. Tourists often visit the P\u00e9tion-Ville area of Port-au-Prince, with other sites of interest including gingerbread houses.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere are a number of hospitals including le Centre Hospitalier du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, H\u00f4pital de l'Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti, Centre Obstetrico Gyn\u00e9cologique Isaie Jeanty-L\u00e9on Audain, H\u00f4pital du Canap\u00e9-Vert, H\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais (Asile Fran\u00e7ais), H\u00f4pital Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Sales, H\u00f4pital-Maternit\u00e9 Sapiens, H\u00f4pital OFATMA, Clinique de la Sant\u00e9, Maternit\u00e9 de Christ Roi, Centre Hospitalier Rue Berne and Maternit\u00e9 Mathieu.\nAfter the 2010 earthquake, two hospitals remained that were operational. The University of Miami in partnership with Project Medishare has created a new hospital, L'H\u00f4pital Bernard Mevs Project Medishare, to provide inpatient and outpatient care for those impacted by the January 2010 earthquake. This hospital is volunteer staffed and provides level 1 trauma care to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding regions.CDTI (Centre de Diagnostique et de Traitement Int\u00e9gr\u00e9) closed in April 2010 when international aid failed to materialize. It had been considered the country's premiere hospital.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the city lies primarily in the center around the National Palace as well as its surrounding areas. The National Museum is located in the grounds of the palace, established in 1938. The National Palace was one of the early structures of the city but was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1918. It was destroyed again by the earthquake on 12 January 2010 which collapsed the center's domed roof.\n\nAnother popular destination in the capital is the Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that was once the private home of two former Haitian presidents. It has become a popular hub for tourist activity in the central city. The Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince is a famed site of cultural interest and attracts foreign visitors to its Neo-Romantic architectural style.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art Ha\u00eftien du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre contains work from some of the country's most talented artists, and the Mus\u00e9e National is a museum featuring historical artifacts such as King Henri Christophe's actual suicide pistol and a rusty anchor that museum operators claim was salvaged from Christopher Columbus's ship, the Santa Mar\u00eda. Other notable cultural sites include the Archives Nationales, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale (National Library) and Expressions Art Gallery. The city is the birthplace of internationally known na\u00efve artist Gesner Abelard, who was associated with the Centre d'Art.\nOn April 5, 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Port-au-Prince was announced.\n\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nThere is a celebration of Bawon Samdi and Gran Brigi called Fet Gede, which takes place from the Day of the Dead on November 1 through the third day of the month. This occurs in the national cemetery of Haiti. While celebrating, people wear Vodou white cotton clothing and purple headscarves. During the celebration, the cemetery becomes packed with people. Those who are celebrating make sacrifices of food for the spirits (mange lwa) and pour liquor on the gravestones among other festivities.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe mayor of Port-au-Prince is Ralph Youri Chevry, who headed the city at the time of the 2010 earthquake.  The city's separate districts (primarily the districts of Delmas, Carrefour, and P\u00e9tion-Ville) are all administered by their own municipal councils. The seat of the state, the Presidential Palace, is located in the Champ de Mars, square plaza of the city. The PNdH (Police Nationale d\u2019Ha\u00efti) is the authority governing the enforcement of city laws.\nThe national police force as of recently, have been increasing in number. However, because of its ailing ineffectiveness and insufficient manpower, a significant number of UN personnel is present throughout the city as part of the stabilization mission in Haiti.\nThe City Hall (Mairie de Port-au-Prince) and most of the city's other government municipal buildings were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPort-au-Prince various educational institutions, ranging from small vocational schools to universities. Influential international schools in Port-au-Prince include Union School, founded in 1919, and Quisqueya Christian School, founded in 1974. Both schools offer an American-style pre-college education. French-speaking students can attend the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais (Lyc\u00e9e Alexandre Dumas), located in Bourdon. Another school is An\u00eds Zun\u00faz\u00ed Bah\u00e1'\u00ed School north west of Port-au-Prince which opened its doors in 1980 which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. Its classes offered transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English. The State University of Haiti (Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti in French or UEH), is located within the capital along other universities such as the Quisqueya University and the Universit\u00e9 des Cara\u00efbes. There are many other institutions that observe the Haitian scholastic program. Many of them are religious academies led by foreign missionaries from France or Canada. These include Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, \u00c9cole Sainte-Rose-de-Lima, \u00c9cole Saint-Jean-Marie Vianney, Institution du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, and Coll\u00e8ge Anne-Marie Javouhey.\nThe Ministry of Education is also located in downtown Port-au-Prince at the Palace of Ministries, adjacent to the National Palace in the Champ de Mars plaza.\nThe Haitian Group of Research and Pedagogical Activities (GHRAP) has set up several community centers for basic education. UNESCO's office at Port-au-Prince has taken a number of initiates in upgrading the educational facilities in Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nA 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in the capital Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012. In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.High-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix-des-Bouquets, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale 1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint-Louverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (\"American\") Road via Route Nationale 1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.In the Bel Air neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAll of the major transportation systems in Haiti are located near or run through the capital. The northern highway, Route Nationale #1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince.  The southern highway, Route Nationale #2 also runs through Port-au-Prince.  Maintenance for these roads lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to lend US$50 million designated for road repairs. The project was canceled in January 1999, however, after auditors revealed corruption. A third major highway, the Haitian Route Nationale #3, connects Port-au-Prince to the central plateau; however, due to its poor condition, it sees limited use.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called \"tap-taps.\"\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\nThe seaport, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the over dozen ports in the country.  The port's facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape.  The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees compared to ports in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nToussaint Louverture International Airport (Ma\u00efs G\u00e2t\u00e9), which opened in 1965 (as Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier International Airport), is north of the city. It is Haiti's major jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Transportation to smaller cities from the major airport is done via smaller aircraft. Companies providing this service include Caribintair and Sunrise Airways.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone\nFamous people from Port-au-Prince\nPort au Prince \u2013 a ship from the Age of Sail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nKolbe, Athena R.; Muggah, Robert (2012). \"\"Haiti's Urban Crime Wave?

        "wiki": "Kontradans or the French-Haitian Contredanse, is creolized dance music formed in the 18th century in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) that evolved from the English contra dance, or (country dance), which eventually spread throughout the Caribbean, Louisiana, Europe and the rest of the New World from the Creoles of Saint-Domingue.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe \"contredanse,\" the French-renamed country dance as indicated in a 1710 dance book called Recuil de Contredance, began in the English courts and was imported to Haiti via France (Brittany) through colonial rule and had been incorporated with African influences in Saint-Domingue. Contredanse flourished as it took on this creolized form establishing strong traditions in Haiti that would later influence variant forms throughout the Caribbean.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe usage of the drums, poetic song, antiphonal song form, and imitations of the colonial elite dance were the elements that had already begun to transform the contredanse.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nA broad group of Saint-Domingue planters, along with their slaves that fled the Haitian Revolution resettled in the old Providence of Oriente in eastern Cuba, that began coffee production around the cities of Santiago and Guantanamo. This settlement provided an impetus of musical activities in those eastern areas. So, this creolized version of contredanse imported from Haiti would fuse with and reinforce the criolla over the next couple of decades. Rhythmic styles such as the tango, habanera, and the cinquillo became dominant patterns as new emerging styles and led to the development of the contradanza, and later in 1879, the danz\u00f3n; a couples dance and is regarded as the first truly national dance genre of Cuba.\n\n\n== M\u00e9ringue ==\nA five-note musical figure called quintolet (cinquillo in Cuba and the rest of the Spanish speaking Caribbean), became a chief feature to the kontradans and would figure prominently into the Haitian folk dance music called m\u00e9ringue (a whipped egg and sugar confection popular in 18th century France), presumably because it captured the essence of the light nature of the dance where one gracefully shifts their weight between feet in a very fluid movement, animating the final section of the Haitian kontradans.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Carrefour (Haitian Creole: Kafou; pronounced [kafu]) is a largely residential commune in the Port-au-Prince Arrondissement, in the Ouest department of Haiti. The commune had a population of 373,916 at the 2003 census, and was officially estimated to have grown to 511,345 inhabitants in 2015. It is mostly a bedroom community for those who work in central Port-au-Prince.\nBefore the exile of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Carrefour was viewed as a Haitian tourist destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nCarrefour was originally a military post in the borough of Port-au-Prince. In March 1795, Louis-Jacques Beauvais and Andr\u00e9 Rigaud, at the head of 3,000 men, routed the English troops occupying the republican port.\nPresident Alexandre Petion, one of the founding fathers of the Haitian homeland, built his private residence in Carrefour, especially in the locality that is still known as Thor. The National School of Thor has been housed in this very house for several decades.\nOn 1 May 1813, a decree of President Alexandre P\u00e9tion founded the village of Carrefour. Following a plan drawn up by surveyor Louis Rigaud, the village was to have 20 islets and 161 sites.\nIn 1869, the Cacos, in rebellion against the government of Sylvain Salnave, occupied Carrefour and attacked the fort of Bizoton without being able to settle there. Indeed, while they were indulging in the delights of the region, Salnave lifted the Piquets of the South, who attacked them from behind and forced them to evacuate the military post. About twenty years later, more precisely on 20 August 1889, at the height of the insurrection of the northerners against President L\u00e9gitime, the vanguard of the Army of the South came to take up a position at Carrefour. The day after (21 August), the day before Legitime's departure, General Justin Carrie fought two battles and was repulsed at Bizoton.\nIn one of his development projects, President Fran\u00e7ois Denys L\u00e9gitime planned to link Carrefour to Port-au-Prince by a line of steamboats along the coast to Leogane.\nCarrefour was elevated to the rank of commune by the decree of 15 December 1982.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe commune of Carrefour is the crossroads through which must pass thousands of cars, vans and trucks to go in a good part of the department of the west, in the departments of the Southeast, the Nippes, the South and the Grande \u2013 Anse. Because of its geographical location and its natural environment, the urban and rural areas of the commune of Carrefour have economic and tourist potentialities.The commune of Carrefour, commonly called \"kafou\" by its nationals, was originally a small village founded by the decree of President Petion the 1st. May 1813. According to the plots of the surveyor Louis Rigaud, this village comprised seven streets, 20 islets and 162 sites.\nFor more than a century and a half, Carrefour has never been urbanized as its founders wished. Its agricultural vocation took precedence over its urbanization. The original settlement provided the surrounding settlements (Monrepos, Lamentin, Mahoti\u00e8re, Thor, Brochette, Mariani) and the various communal sections supplied the villagers of Carrefour and the town of Port-au-Prince with agricultural products such as rice, cane Sugar, cotton, fruit, vegetables, food, coffee, & c. It was not until the mid-1970s that the anarchic urbanization of the area began. This \"urbanization\" coincides with the liquidation of the main houses by the large landowners of Carrefour.\nOn 15 December 1982, 169 years after its founding, the village of Carrefour, which became the neighborhood of Carrefour, was elevated to the rank of commune by the decree of 15 December 1982. Carrefour forms with Port-au-Prince, Petion -Ville, Kenscoff, Gressier and Delmas, the borough of Port-au-Prince. The rural area, which is fairly extensive, comprises the following 13 communal sections: Bizoton, Thor, Froide River, Corail Thor, Morne-\u00e0-Chandelle, Platon Dufresney, Taillefer, Procy, Bouvier, Coupeau, Laval, Berly and Malanga.\nThe topography of Carrefour is not quite different from that of Port-au-Prince. Like the latter, the municipality of Carrefour rises to the bottom of the Gulf of Gonave. It includes a mountainous part including the hills Malanga, Chandelle, Boyer, Froide River, Dufr\u00e9n\u00e9, Corail Thor.\nIts geographical limits extend from the east to the north, from the junction of Fontamara 43 with the coastline until it meets Port-au-Prince Bay and along this coast until its meeting with The ravine of Mariani. From the northwest, they turn south to the limit of the 12th Section of Morne-\u00e0-Bateau, the 23rd Section of the Parks and the 8th Section of Beau-S\u00e9jour de la as of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne. From there, they rejoin the boundaries of the 7th Section, Great River, 4th Section, Gosseline which belongs to the commune of Jacmel, and the 2 nd Section, Nouvelle-Tourraine and the 20 th Section, Bongars, Of the commune of Kenscoff. They again rejoin Fontamara 43 by the South-South-East trajectory of the 8th Section, Martissant, of the commune of Port-au-Prince. The coordinates of the municipality are located on the one hand between 72 \u00b0 22 'and 72 \u00b0 27 west longitude and on the other hand between 18 \u00b0 30' and 18 \u00b0 35 'north latitude. Its area is estimated at 190 km\u00b2.\nAs far as hydrography is concerned, the Froide River, one of the most important watercourses in the municipality, flows through Communal Sections of Plato Dufresney and continues to the Pond Section of the commune Of Petion-Ville. Then the river of Chauffard which irrigates the houses of the communal section Procy, that of Bengas at the level of Kenscoff and that of Momance or Grande-Rivi\u00e8re, between the communal sections of Procy and Laval. Among the less important rivers The Grandin River, the Morel and Time-Perdu gullies.\nOn the demographic level, the commune of Carrefour has a population of more than 500,000 (five hundred thousand) inhabitants. However, it remains extremely difficult to have more or less reliable statics on the population of Carrefour. According to the 1982 census, Carrefour had a population of 129 470 people; The 2003 census has a population of 373,916 inhabitants. Based on 4.24, the annual growth rate of its population, today, Carrefour would have a population of 460 251 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== List of communal sections of Carrefour ===\nThe communal section (French: section communale, formerly section rurale) is the smallest administrative division in Haiti.\n\nPostal Code of Carrefour :\n\nHT6130 : Carrefour\nHT6131 : Bizoton\nHT6132 : Diquini, Thor\nHT6133 : C\u00f4te-Page, Mahoti\u00e8re\nHT6134 : Arcachon, Warney\nHT6135 : Brochette\nHT6136 : Lamentin, Mariani, Merger\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Carrefour is one of the largest municipalities in the Republic of Haiti if its size and population are taken into account. It comprises 13 communal sections. Its urban center is subdivided into zones or districts: part of Fontamara, Bizoton, Diquini, Thor, Mahoti\u00e8re, C\u00f4te-Plage, Waney, Arcachon, Monrepos, Brochette, Lamentin, Rivi\u00e8re Froide, part of Mariani. Some of these neighborhoods have more than 10000 inhabitants.\nMost of the territory of the municipality of Carrefour is concentrated in its mountainous municipal sections. The lack of improved roads makes access by car or truck difficult; In most cases, the use of vehicles in these environments is completely impossible. With a population of more than 500,000 inhabitants, human pressure on the environment is growing.\nWhen it comes to the relationship between urban and rural areas, Carrefour is no exception to the rule. Generally, in all municipalities of Haiti, the urban center commonly called \"bouk or lavil\" depends on their communal sections \u2013 most often located in the mountainous areas \u2013 for their food and drinking water supply. Despite this dependence, the communal sections are still treated as the country outside. When at the town hall, the only time a resident of a communal section will hear about the town hall is before the municipal elections. Although the so-called urban dwellers live on resources from rural areas, it has never occurred to them that these resources are inexhaustible. Their contempt for the rural environment and the concentration of services in the urban area have contributed to the abandonment of the countryside: the rural exodus.\nIt is the exploitation of quarries and extensive agriculture that pose a problem: they have an important social role because they employ thousands of people, but these activities cause the destruction of the environments. Operation accelerates water runoff, sediment accumulation and soil erosion. Farmers find themselves obliged to cultivate steeper land and make charcoal with the vegetation cover. The degradation of the environment is thus explained by a spatial inorganization. Some associations advocate more efficient development and campaign for clean-up or reconstruction.\nForest cover in Haiti is currently less than 3%. The depletion of water sources across the country is a direct result of deforestation. Until the second half of the 1980s, the Carrefour hills were largely covered with fruit and forest trees. As for the Froide River, its water was still crystalline. Thousands of people were still bathing there daily. In addition, every day, hundreds of women relied on this river to earn money after washing for customers who were always loyal to the appointment.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nUnlike the majority of municipalities in the Republic of Haiti, agriculture occupies a very small place in Carrefour's economy. The commune of Carrefour occupies remains an appendix of Port-au-Prince. The secondary and tertiary sectors primarily supply its economic circuit. Nevertheless, agricultural activities are undertaken in the communal sections of Morne Chandelle, Plateau Dufresney, Taillefer, Procy, Coupeau, Laval, Bouvier and Malanga.\nThe inhabitants of all the communal sections of Carrefour depend mainly on agriculture; Coffee, vegetables, cereals, food and cane-sugar are grown there. There are also cattle (oxen, cabris, backyard birds on a very small scale), with the exception of coffee, an imported commodity grown on the hills of Rivi\u00e8re Froide, Dufresney and Corail Thor, The farmers of the communal sections of Carrefour only practice subsistence farming, in other words, their agricultural production does not have a significant impact on the economy of the commune, and the urban area where the majority Of the population, the economy works like the big Haitian cities, or even better.\nOn the other hand, in the urban center of Carrefour are concentrated on the one hand the main public services: the tribunal of peace, the Taxation Department, the police station, the registry office, the Coast Guard, The largest sports complex in the country. In addition, commercial activities: banks, supermarkets, bazaars, bakeries, public market, shops, pharmacies, etc. Industrial establishments such as paint factories, Haiti Metal, Mariani Tannery, Cuir SA, Adventist Packaging, SAFICO, ALTA and TOLI, STEP-OVER and oil companies (the National, Shell, Texaco, ESSO).\nTwo hospitals and numerous private clinics provide health care at the level of the commune of Carrefour: Diquini Adventist Hospital and Carrefour Hopital Maternit\u00e9. Despite the presence of these hospitals, many Carrefourrois still continue to visit the hospitals and clinics located in the city of Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n== Education ==\nA large number of public and private schools provide education at primary, secondary, vocational and university levels. In the last twenty years, due to the rural exodus to the center and the growing demand for education, primary and secondary schools have multiplied in Carrefour. Despite the presence of very good institutions in Carrefour, thousands of adolescents residing in the commune still continue to attend the schools located in Port-au-Prince.\nList of Schools in Carrefour\n\nEnsemble Scolaire P\u00e8re Basile Moreau (ESPBM)\nJuv\u00e9nat du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur\nLyc\u00e9e Louis Joseph Janvier\nColl\u00e8ge Univers Fr\u00e8re Rapha\u00ebl\nColl\u00e8ge de C\u00f4te-Plage\nL'Ecole des S\u0153urs Sal\u00e9siennes\nL'\u00c9cole Notre Dame de l'Assomption\nL'\u00c9cole Nationale de Thor\nColl\u00e8ge Catherine Flon\nCentre d'\u00c9tudes Secondaires\nCentre Polyvalent\nColl\u00e8ge Paul Etzer\nL'\u00c9cole R\u00e9publique du Centre Afrique\nLe Lyc\u00e9e de Diquini\nColl\u00e8ge de Radio Lumi\u00e8re\nColl\u00e8ge Adventiste de Diquini\nL'Universit\u00e9 Adventiste\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nIn the 1970s and into the second half of the 1980s, Carrefour occupied a prominent position in tourism in Haiti. It was for Haitian and foreign tourists a favorite destination. However, after the collapse of the Duvalier regime and the ensuing instability, the tourist industry completely collapsed.\nWhat is to be emphasized is the general idea of the urban areas of the commune of Carrefour. In the eyes of more than one, Carrefour represents above all a state of mind, a way of life. Its agglomerations and its many streets and alleys are characterized by great animation, exuberant joy, a deconcentrated and non-conformist way of living.\nUntil the end of the 80s, there was in the city of Carrefour a pleiade of night clubs commonly called \"Bo\u00eete de Nui.\" These leisure centers (Hotel- Bars-Restaurant) were swarming in the urban center of Carrefour. The Spanish consonance of some of these centers testifies to the presence and influence of a large Dominican in the municipality. These include: Copa Cabana, El Baraquito, Rancho Cocktail, Corso Disco Club, Poco a Poco Bar, Mi Casa Hotel-Bar-Restaurant, Madruga Disco-Restaurant-Hotel, etc.\nOther attractions in the area include M\u00e9ridien Club, Paradis des Amis Restaurant-Hotel, Paladium Night Club, Downtown Disco Club, Mermaid Beach Hotel, Etoile de David Bar-Restaurant, Auberge du Qu\u00e9bec, Chez Nounoune, Bamboulinos Hotel. But the most famous of these centers, either because of the luxury they offer or the musical groups that animated them, were the Lambi Night Club, the Domaine Ideal (whose clientele was mainly foreign), the Tiboukan Auberge Restaurant, the Three Fish and Chez Cator famous for its \"pwason gwo s\u00e8l.\" Most of these establishments built on the seashore all enjoyed a very caressing breeze through the seasons.\nOn the other hand, the entertainment was enriched by the various cinemas: the Coliseum, Cric Crac Cine, Crystal Cine. There was also the cockfighting, especially at the Amical Gaguere de Mariani. As for the communal sections, the gargoyles hold the top of the bill.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nReligious activities are multifaceted. It is a true syncretism Catholics, vodouisants, Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses and adepts of various confessions compete with fervor. The churches dedicated to Saint Charles and Our Lady of Mount Carmel bring together an immense crowd of faithful from the surrounding districts and Port-au-Prince on the occasion of the patron festivals of 4 November and 16 July. As for the chapel of Saint Anthony, it is a permanent center of interest. Placed at the top of Merger, it never ceases to drain pilgrims. Other chapels exist in the communal sections.\nThe Protestant churches are found everywhere in the commune of Carrefour. Very often, late in the night, the quarters vibrate with their prayers and their songs of adoration. This establishes a very clear contrast with the dance music of night clubs or nightclubs. On the other hand, there are also the houmforts where the followers of the voodoo pay homage to the African gods, the loas. In this religious atmosphere, certain signs will never cease to astonish an observer: \"God alone inspires us and science enlightens us: Botanica Sciencia de San Juan Templa.\" Macoumba.\nWhat is particularly pleasing to point out are the social works undertaken by the different religious denominations. Outside the impressive schools, some have orphanages, canteens, places of retreat, and so on.\nOn 10 December 1905, the parish of Carrefour was erected by Mgr. Conan, two years after his elevation as Archbishop of Port-au-Prince. Carrefour was a small chapel in the parish of Sainte Anne, dedicated to Saint Charles of Borome. The first parish priest was R. P. Lebihain. Then, the Monfortains took possession of the Parish of Carrefour. A contract had been signed between the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince and the company of Mary (Monfortains) supported by Rome.\nOn 20 February 1910, Paul Marie Lebihain was appointed parish priest of Port-de-Paix and Vicar General of the Society of Mary, replaced by Father Brochard (1910\u20131947), RP Doriel (1947\u20131972) and Father Eustache Saint Hubert (1972\u2013), etc.\nThe Monfortian monks built the presbytery, the church, a parish hall, chapels in the communal sections all by Fathers Dorel and Saint Hubert\nThe Parish of Carrefour has eight chapels scattered in the communal sections: Morne-a-Bateau, dedicated to Saint Antoine; Great River, Saint Paul; Morne-\u00e0-Chandelle, Saint Michel; Boucan Marie, Our Lady of the Annunciation; Bouvier, Holy Heart of Mary; Coupeau, Our Lady of Lourdes; Wiailles, Saint Francis Xavier; C\u00f4te-Plages, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.\nIn addition, under the administration of Father Dor\u00e9lien, several religious communities settled in the Parish of Carrefour: the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, the Salesian Sisters, the Little Sisters of Saint Teresa, the Little Brothers of Saint Teresa, the Girls Of Wisdom and the Oblate Missionaries.\n\n\n== Gouvernements and Politics ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nCarrefour has a municipal council (conseil municipal) compound of three members elected by the inhabitants of the commune for a 4-year term. The municipal council is led by a president often called mayor.\nCarrefour has a municipal assembly (assembl\u00e9e municipale) who assists the council in its work.\nThe members of the assembly are also elected for 4 years.\nMunicipal Councils (2016\u20132020)\n\nJude Edouard Pierre (Mayor)\nMaxo Bourdeau\nDarlyne JosephMunicipal Assembly (2016\u20132020)\n\n\n== 2010 earthquake ==\nOn 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti caused heavy damage to residential buildings in Carrefour, with 40 to 50 per cent of buildings destroyed in the town's worst-affected areas. One of the damaged facilities was the city's hospital.In the wake of the quake, the Cuban military set up a field hospital in the region. Electricity was restored to some sectors at the beginning of February.As of 9 February 2010, the US 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is rotating out of Haiti, having been replaced by the US 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, in their position on USS Bataan and Carrefour, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Grand-Go\u00e2ve and Petit-Go\u00e2ve.As of 7 March 2010, a donated Fujifilm X-ray machine has arrived at the Adventists Medical Center.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity Hall of Carrefour, Website of the City Hall of Carrefour, Haiti\nReuters, \"Comprehensive Building Damage Assessment for Carrefour Commune, Haiti (Version 3)\", 15 February 2010\nReuters, \"Intensity of Building Damages in Central Carrefour, Haiti\", 25 February 2010",

        "wiki": "Jean-L\u00e9on Destin\u00e9 (March 26, 1918 \u2013 January 22, 2013) was a Haitian-born American dancer and choreographer.  He was born in Saint-Marc and moved to the United States with the dance company of Lina Mathon-Blanchet in the early 1940s.  He later studied at Howard University.  His work, becoming well known in the 1940s, often addressed Haiti's history of resisting colonialism and slavery. He also danced with Katherine Dunham's company and founded a national dance company in Haiti in the late 1940s. Destin\u00e9 is known as the father of Haitian professional dance.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDestin\u00e9 was born in Saint Marc, Haiti to middle class parents. His father worked for the government and his mother was a seamstress. His parents divorced when he was a child and he moved with his mother to Port-au-Prince.Destin\u00e9 became interested in drumming and dancing at an early age. He also sang in Lina Mathon Blanchet's folkloric singing group as a young man.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1941 Destine came to the United States for the first time to dance with Fussman-Mathon's folkloric dance troupe at the National Folk Festival in Washington D.C. When Destine returned home to Haiti they assigned him to be a cultural ambassador for the Haitian government to educate people on Haitian art and dance to increase tourism in Haiti. He led his country's dance troupe known as La Troupe Folklorique Nationale and taught many people how to dance. He produced and choreographed some of the biggest Haitian dances in the United States.In 1946 Destin\u00e9 performed on Broadway in Katherine Dunham's production of Bal Negre until 1948. At the same time Destin\u00e9 performed at parties for Langston Hughes. As a result of his prominence in New York City Destin\u00e9 was able to create his own dance company, Destin\u00e9 Afro-Haitian Dance Company. He went on to star in the film Witch Doctor which premiered in 1948. He also appeared at the New York City opera in 1949 in Troubled Island.In 1949 Destin\u00e9 choreographed and danced his famous Slave Dance at 200 year anniversary of the founding of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. According to Polyne, \"This routine interpreted the evolution of enslaved African descendants from the point of bondage to their physical and psychological emancipation. At the moment of rebellion, Destin\u00e9 struggled with the chainsthat imprisoned him and eventually broke free, energetically dancing throughout the ballroom demonstrating the emergence of a revolution and the beginning of a free Black republic.\"Destin\u00e9 was also part of Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. He began dancing and choreographing at Jacob's Pillow in 1949 with his first performance being Carnival Dance. Destin\u00e9 would go on to perform and choreograph at Jacob's Pillow until 1970. He later returned in 2004 to direct the Cultural Traditions Program. His legacy lives on within the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.\nDestin\u00e9 was associated with the American Dance Festival when it was in residence at Connecticut College. He began working as instructor in 1962, he was one of the first Black choreographers to work with the American Dance Festival. He choreographed and performed with his Haitian Dance Troupe and drummers Aphlonse Cimber and Eder Calvin on April 30, 1965 at the Frank Loomis Palmer Auditorium at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut.In the 1980s and 1990s Destin\u00e9 taught at several places in the NYC area. The Clark Center and Lezly's Dance and Skate were just two of the places he taught at primarily teaching Haitian and African dance.In 2003, Destin\u00e9 reviewer a program at Symphony Space and he also performed in it.\n\n\n== Style ==\nJean L\u00e9on Destin\u00e9 took classes with Jean Price Mars at Bureau d'Ethnologie in Port-au-Prince. This school was important to Black and indigenous culture in Haiti, because it fought back against the assumptions and ideas that Black people were inferior to whites. It was at this school that Destin\u00e9 learned the history of West African influence on Haiti, Vodou, and Haitian folklore. Jean Leon Destin\u00e9 started to incorporate these styles into his dance, where he produced dances that pushed back against the dominant colonial ideas of his country. Jean L\u00e9on Destin\u00e9 created his own style of what is known as \"Haitian dance\" today that infuses styles of West African and Vodou.\n\n\n== Awards and Honors[edit] ==\nDestin\u00e9 was a two time recipient of the Officier Honneur et M\u00e9rite for his contributions to Haitian arts and culture. He also received awards for his role in Witch Doctor at the Venice and Edinburgh Film Festivals, which also received the first Omnibus.\n\n\n== Choreography ==\nHaitian Dances (1949)\nMartinique (1950)\nFantasie D'amour (1950)\nCreole Fantasie (1951)\nInitiation of the Hounsi (1951)\nJaibo (1961)\nVillage Festival (circa 1965)\nCreole Songs (circa 1965)\nBaptism of the Drum (circa 1965)\nYoruba Bakas (circa 1965)\nFantasie Musicale (circa 1965)\nWitch Doctor (circa 1965)\nBal Champetre (circa 1965)\nSerenade Tropicale (circa 1965)\nMazurka Creole (circa 1965)\nSpider Dancee (circa 1965)\nLa Legende De L' Assotor (circa 1965)\n\n\n== References ==",

Haitians of Apparent Project create stunning bracelets, jewelry, clothing, and beautiful art pieces made out of trash, metal, aluminum, dirt, and paper by the mothers and fathers of once orphaned children of Haiti. Currently The Apparent Projects artisans include metal sculptors, jewelry makers, paper makers, bookbinders, seamstresses, and ceramicists. They are looking to expand into new artistic ventures and love hosting small teams for intensive trainings. They produce jobs for mothers and fathers who don't want to have to abandon their children to an orphanage because of extreme poverty. They provide hope through the dignity of a job, training, and the ability to create something new out of something discarded and seemingly unusable. Apparent Project is a socially and ecologically conscious business with a mission of stimulating the Haitian economy and bringing an end to poverty-based relinquishment of children in Haiti.Apparent Project is the business incubator for start-up businesses that help aid in the economic situation of families in Haiti. Apparent Project also does community development, education, job skills training, medical relief, prenatal care, and continues to market and promote Papillon goods as well as other Haitian artisan goods through its party sales and fundraisers. While redeeming the Haitian landscape, these artisans are also bringing new hope to their families, employing themselves for a brighter future and earning the means to pay for their children's food, shelter, and education. Apparent Project's goal is to see Haitian families stay together. Skill development and employment addresses the needs of families before they are at the point of desperation, driven to give their children to an orphanage because of extreme poverty. They see their artisans\u2019 guild as an \u201cun-orphanage.\u201d They are finding creative ways for Haitians to be self-employed so that they can take care of their own children with dignity and joy.\n\n\n== Location ==\nRue Cassagnol Prolongee, Impasse Gedeon #5 Delmas 75, Port-au-Prince Haiti 3194-1267.\n\n\n== Background ==\nShelley Clay is the founder and director of the Apparent Project. She is a social entrepreneur and mother of four. Two of her kids are adopted from Haiti where she resides full-time with her family. In 2008, Shelley moved to Port-au-Prince and went to work in an orphanage.  From the success of the Apparent Project, was birthed a social business, \"Papillon Enterprise\", which translates those new creative skills into sustainable jobs While starting Papillon Enterprise as a nonprofit, Shelley Clay used grants\u2014including one from the Clinton Foundation that helped expand her present facilities in Delmas 75, Port-au-Prince\u2014to leverage what's become a for-profit business. At the end of 2010 they sold $100,000 in jewelry, through their nonprofit overseas exchange, Apparent Project. In 2013, Apparent Project's Papillon Enterprise had an estimated $1 million in sales. In that time the company has grown from 40 workers to about 300 plus in 2016. Many of them Clay hired as she visited orphanages and then tent cities following the earthquake of 2010. Her desire is to see the issues of poverty tackled through sustainable economic empowerment of the poor. Papillon Enterprise exists to give job skills to heads of households and particularly mothers in order to prevent child relinquishment.\n\n\n== Papillon Enterprise ==\nIn 2009, Apparent Project was no longer under the radar and had to formalize as a business in Haiti. This business was called Papillon Enterprise. Papillon became the legal production center for all things Apparent Project. Papillon's establishment allowed the artisans to keep working legally, and allowed many more employees to be hired. Apparent Project was the distributor of things made by Papillon.\n\n\n== Wages ==\nMinimum wage in Haiti is $5 per day and the average person makes $2 per day. Employees of The Apparent Project make $15 per day plus medical coverage. Her employees also now include 30 inmates who are rolling beads for two hours a day and getting paid for it. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Shelley Clay said, \u201cbecause in Haiti you can\u2019t go to trial without money.\u201d She hopes to expand job opportunities in prisons, including a nearby women's prison.\n\n\n== Partnerships ==\nThe Apparent Project partners with smaller nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and faith-based nonprofits like The Global Orphan Project. In spring 2016, the Global Orphan Project (GO) carried necklaces and bracelets made by Apparent Project through its GO Exchange, which sells locally made clothing and accessories from Haiti, Uganda, and Ethiopia.  They also have partnerships with stores like Gap and designers like Donna Karan, who make bulk orders Kim Kardashian, Maria Bello, Patricia Arquette, Olivia Wilde, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Clinton are supporters of Apparent Project along with many others.\n\n\n=== Clinton Foundation's Support ===\nOn July 29, 2015, Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala, Chelsea Clinton, and Clinton Foundation supporters visited The Apparent Project.  With support from the Clinton Foundation, they reached new buyers, leading to larger market access, and ultimately allowing them to create jobs while providing healthcare and on-site day care for all of its 300 workers.  In 2013, the Clinton Foundation provided a grant to Papillon Enterprise.  The grant covered a building, more Haitian staff, and supplies.  Through a Clinton Foundation investment, Papillion Enterprise was able to purchase kilns and other resources that allowed them to produce clay beads and other ceramic products. The kilns require significant energy and were increasing costs, so through a partnership they were able to provide a roof-top solar system to power them, and most of the operations, with renewable energy.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nhttp://www.apparentproject.org\nhttp://www.papillon-enterprise.com\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nApparent Project Official Website\nPapillon Enterprise Official Site\nMarket for Jewelry and Other Artifacts Sold Website\nClinton Foundation Website\nFundraising Opportunities Website\nHealing Haiti (Mission Trip)",

The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince, Delmas, Cite Soleil, Tabarre, Carrefour, and P\u00e9tion-Ville.\nThe city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve: the bay on which the city lies, which acts as a natural harbor, has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Arawaks. It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city's layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area's population at around 3.7 million, nearly half of the country's national population. The city was catastrophically affected by a devastating earthquake in 2010, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti's government estimated the death toll to be 230,000.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPort-au-Prince literally means \"Port of the Prince\", but it is unclear which prince was the honoree. \nA theory is that the place is named after Le Prince, a ship captained by de Saint-Andr\u00e9 which arrived in the area in 1706. \nHowever, the islets in the bay had already been known as les \u00eelets du Prince as early as 1680, predating the ship's arrival. \nFurthermore, the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H\u00f4pital, named after the filibusters' hospital.French colonial commissioner \u00c9tienne Polverel named the city Port-R\u00e9publicain on 23 September 1793 \"in order that the inhabitants be kept continually in mind of the obligations which the French Revolution imposed on them.\" It was later renamed back to Port-au-Prince by Jacques I, Emperor of Haiti.When Haiti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south, Port-au-Prince was the capital of the republic, under the leadership of Alexandre P\u00e9tion. Henri Christophe renamed the city Port-aux-Crimes after the assassination of Jacques I at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge, and located north of the city).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish colonization ===\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the island of Hispaniola was inhabited by people known as the Ta\u00edno, who arrived in approximately 2600 BC in large dugout canoes. They are believed to come primarily from what is now eastern Venezuela. By the time Columbus arrived in 1492 AD, the region was under the control of Bohechio, Ta\u00edno cacique (chief) Xaragua. He, like his predecessors, feared settling too close to the coast; such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the Caribes, who lived on neighboring islands. Instead, the region served as a hunting ground. The population of the region was approximately 400,000 at the time, but the Ta\u00ednos were gone within 30 years of the arrival of the Spaniards.With the arrival of the Spaniards, the Amerindians were forced to accept a protectorate, and Bohechio, childless at death, was succeeded by his sister, Anacaona, wife of the cacique Caonabo. The Spanish insisted on larger tributes. Eventually, the Spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly, and in 1503, Nicolas Ovando, then governor, set about to put an end to the r\u00e9gime headed by Anacaona. He invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast, and when the Amerindians had drunk a good deal of wine (the Spaniards did not drink on that occasion), he ordered most of the guests killed. Anacaona was spared, only to be hanged publicly some time later. Through violence and murders, the Spanish settlers decimated the native population.\nDirect Spanish rule over the area having been established, Ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast (west of Etang Saum\u00e2tre), ironically named Santa Maria de la Paz Verdadera, which would be abandoned several years later. Not long thereafter, Ovando founded Santa Maria del Puerto. The latter was first burned by French explorers in 1535, then again in 1592 by the English. These assaults proved to be too much for the Spanish colonial administration, and in 1606, it decided to abandon the region.\n\n\n=== Domination of the flibustiers ===\nFor more than 50 years, the area that is today Port-au-Prince saw its population drop off drastically, when some buccaneers began to use it as a base, and Dutch merchants began to frequent it in search of leather, as game was abundant there. Around 1650, French flibustiers, running out of room on the \u00cele de la Tortue began to arrive on the coast, and established a colony at Trou-Borded. As the colony grew, they set up a hospital not far from the coast, on the Turgeau heights. This led to the region being known as H\u00f4pital.\nAlthough there had been no real Spanish presence in H\u00f4pital for well over 50 years, Spain retained its formal claim to the territory, and the growing presence of the French flibustiers on ostensibly Spanish lands provoked the Spanish crown to dispatch Castilian soldiers to H\u00f4pital to retake it. The mission proved to be a disaster for the Spanish, as they were outnumbered and outgunned, and in 1697, the Spanish government signed the Treaty of Ryswick, renouncing any claims to H\u00f4pital. Around this time, the French also established bases at Ester (part of Petite Rivi\u00e8re) and Gona\u00efves.\nEster was a rich village, inhabited by merchants, and equipped with straight streets; it was here that the governor lived. On the other hand, the surrounding region, Petite-Rivi\u00e8re, was quite poor. Following a great fire in 1711, Ester was abandoned. Yet the French presence in the region continued to grow, and soon afterward, a new city was founded to the south, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.\n\nWhile the first French presence in H\u00f4pital, the region later to contain Port-au-Prince was that of the flibustiers; as the region became a real French colony, the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates. While useful in repelling Englishmen intent on encroaching upon French territory, they were relatively independent, unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration, and a potential threat to it. Therefore, in the winter of 1707, Choiseul-Beaupr\u00e9, the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat. He insisted upon control of the hospital, but the flibustiers refused, considering that humiliating. They proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor, and many of them became habitans (farmers) the first long-term European inhabitants in the region.\nAlthough the elimination of the flibustiers as a group from H\u00f4pital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration, it also made the region a more attractive target for the English. In order to protect the area, in 1706, a captain named de Saint-Andr\u00e9 sailed into the bay just below the hospital, in a ship named Le Prince. It is said that M. de Saint-Andr\u00e9 named the area Port-au-Prince (meaning \"Port of the Prince\"), but the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H\u00f4pital, but the islets in the bay had already been known as les \u00eelets du Prince as early as 1680.\nThe English did not trouble the area, and various nobles sought land grants from the French crown in H\u00f4pital; the first noble to control H\u00f4pital was Sieur Joseph Randot. Upon his death in 1737, Sieur Pierre Morel gained control over part of the region, with Gatien Bretton des Chapelles acquiring another portion of it.\nBy then, the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen, in order to better control the French portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). For a time, Petit-Go\u00e2ve and L\u00e9og\u00e2ne vied for this honor, but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons. Neither was centrally located. Petit-Go\u00e2ve's climate caused it to be too malarial, and L\u00e9ogane's topography made it difficult to defend. Thus, in 1749, a new city was built, Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Port-au-Prince ===\n\nIn 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (the modern Cap-Ha\u00eftien) as capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue.In November 1791, it was burned in a battle between attacking black revolutionists and defending white plantation owners.It was captured by British troops on June 4, 1794.In 1804, it became the capital of newly independent Ha\u00efti. When Jean-Jacques Dessalines was assassinated in 1806, Port-au-Prince became the capital of the mulatto-dominated south (Cap-Ha\u00eftien was the capital of the black-dominated north). It was re-established as the capital of all of Haiti when the country was unified again in 1820.\n\n\n=== American occupation ===\nDuring the American occupation of Haiti (1915\u20131934), Port-au-Prince, garrisoned by American Marines and Haitian gendarmes, was attacked twice by caco rebels. The first battle, which took place in 1919, was a victory of the American and Haitian government forces, as was the second attack in 1920.\n\n\n=== 2010 earthquake ===\n\nOn 12 January 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, devastating the city. Most of the central historic area of the city was destroyed, including Haiti's prized Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince, the capital building, Legislative Palace (the parliament building), Palace of Justice (Supreme Court building), several ministerial buildings, and at least one hospital. The second floor of the Presidential Palace was thrown into the first floor, and the domes skewed at a severe tilt. The seaport and airport were both damaged, limiting aid shipments. The seaport was severely damaged by the quake and was unable to accept aid shipments for the first week.\nThe airport's control tower was damaged and the US military had to set up a new control center with generators to get the airport prepared for aid flights. Aid has been delivered to Port-au-Prince by numerous nations and voluntary groups as part of a global relief effort. On Wednesday, January 20, 2010, an aftershock rated at a magnitude of 5.9 caused additional damage.\n\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\n\nThe worst hurricane season experienced by Haiti occurred in 2008 when four storms Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike negatively impacted Haiti. Nearly 800 people were killed; 22,000 homes were destroyed; 70% of the country's crops were lost, according to reliefweb.org.  Then, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, while not making direct impact, resulted in 75 deaths, $250 million in damage and a resurgence of cholera that was estimated to infected 5,000 people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe metropolitan area is subdivided into various communes (districts). There is a ring of districts that radiates out from the commune of Port-au-Prince. P\u00e9tion-Ville is an affluent suburban commune located southeast of the city. Delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city, and the rather poor commune of Carrefour is located southwest of the city.\nThe commune harbors many low-income slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, is situated.  However, Cit\u00e9 Soleil has been recently split off from Port-au-Prince proper to form a separate commune. The Champ de Mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently.  The downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPort-au-Prince has a tropical wet and dry climate and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Port-au-Prince's wet season runs from March through November, though the city experiences a relative break in rainfall during the month of July. The city's dry season covers the remaining three months.  Port-au-Prince generally experiences warm and humid conditions during the dry season and hot and humid conditions during the wet season.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the area was 1,234,742.\nThe majority of the population is of African descent, but a prominent biracial minority controls many of the city's businesses. There are sizable numbers of Hispanic residents, Asians, as well as a number of Europeans (both foreign born and native born).\nCitizens of Arab (particularly Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian) ancestry are a minority with a presence in the capital. Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in Port-au-Prince) are, more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. Most of the biracial residents of the city are concentrated within wealthier areas.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nPort-au-Prince is one of the nation's largest centers of economy and finance. The capital exports its most widely consumed produce of coffee and sugar, and has, in the past, exported other goods, such as shoes and baseballs. Port-au-Prince has food-processing plants as well as soap, textile and cement factories. Despite political unrest, the city also relies on the tourism industry and construction companies to move its economy. Port-au-Prince was once a popular place for cruises, but has lost nearly all of its tourism, and no longer has cruise ships coming into port.\nUnemployment in Port-au-Prince is high, and compounded further by underemployment. Levels of economic activity remain prominent throughout the city, especially among people selling goods and services on the streets. Informal employment is believed to be widespread in Port-au-Prince's slums, as otherwise the population could not survive. Port-au-Prince has several upscale districts in which crime rates are significantly lower than in the city center.Port-au-Prince has a tourism industry. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport (referred to often as the Port-au-Prince International Airport) is the country's main international gateway for tourists. Tourists often visit the P\u00e9tion-Ville area of Port-au-Prince, with other sites of interest including gingerbread houses.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere are a number of hospitals including le Centre Hospitalier du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, H\u00f4pital de l'Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti, Centre Obstetrico Gyn\u00e9cologique Isaie Jeanty-L\u00e9on Audain, H\u00f4pital du Canap\u00e9-Vert, H\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais (Asile Fran\u00e7ais), H\u00f4pital Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Sales, H\u00f4pital-Maternit\u00e9 Sapiens, H\u00f4pital OFATMA, Clinique de la Sant\u00e9, Maternit\u00e9 de Christ Roi, Centre Hospitalier Rue Berne and Maternit\u00e9 Mathieu.\nAfter the 2010 earthquake, two hospitals remained that were operational. The University of Miami in partnership with Project Medishare has created a new hospital, L'H\u00f4pital Bernard Mevs Project Medishare, to provide inpatient and outpatient care for those impacted by the January 2010 earthquake. This hospital is volunteer staffed and provides level 1 trauma care to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding regions.CDTI (Centre de Diagnostique et de Traitement Int\u00e9gr\u00e9) closed in April 2010 when international aid failed to materialize. It had been considered the country's premiere hospital.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the city lies primarily in the center around the National Palace as well as its surrounding areas. The National Museum is located in the grounds of the palace, established in 1938. The National Palace was one of the early structures of the city but was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1918. It was destroyed again by the earthquake on 12 January 2010 which collapsed the center's domed roof.\n\nAnother popular destination in the capital is the Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that was once the private home of two former Haitian presidents. It has become a popular hub for tourist activity in the central city. The Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince is a famed site of cultural interest and attracts foreign visitors to its Neo-Romantic architectural style.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art Ha\u00eftien du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre contains work from some of the country's most talented artists, and the Mus\u00e9e National is a museum featuring historical artifacts such as King Henri Christophe's actual suicide pistol and a rusty anchor that museum operators claim was salvaged from Christopher Columbus's ship, the Santa Mar\u00eda. Other notable cultural sites include the Archives Nationales, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale (National Library) and Expressions Art Gallery. The city is the birthplace of internationally known na\u00efve artist Gesner Abelard, who was associated with the Centre d'Art.\nOn April 5, 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Port-au-Prince was announced.\n\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nThere is a celebration of Bawon Samdi and Gran Brigi called Fet Gede, which takes place from the Day of the Dead on November 1 through the third day of the month. This occurs in the national cemetery of Haiti. While celebrating, people wear Vodou white cotton clothing and purple headscarves. During the celebration, the cemetery becomes packed with people. Those who are celebrating make sacrifices of food for the spirits (mange lwa) and pour liquor on the gravestones among other festivities.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe mayor of Port-au-Prince is Ralph Youri Chevry, who headed the city at the time of the 2010 earthquake.  The city's separate districts (primarily the districts of Delmas, Carrefour, and P\u00e9tion-Ville) are all administered by their own municipal councils. The seat of the state, the Presidential Palace, is located in the Champ de Mars, square plaza of the city. The PNdH (Police Nationale d\u2019Ha\u00efti) is the authority governing the enforcement of city laws.\nThe national police force as of recently, have been increasing in number. However, because of its ailing ineffectiveness and insufficient manpower, a significant number of UN personnel is present throughout the city as part of the stabilization mission in Haiti.\nThe City Hall (Mairie de Port-au-Prince) and most of the city's other government municipal buildings were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPort-au-Prince various educational institutions, ranging from small vocational schools to universities. Influential international schools in Port-au-Prince include Union School, founded in 1919, and Quisqueya Christian School, founded in 1974. Both schools offer an American-style pre-college education. French-speaking students can attend the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais (Lyc\u00e9e Alexandre Dumas), located in Bourdon. Another school is An\u00eds Zun\u00faz\u00ed Bah\u00e1'\u00ed School north west of Port-au-Prince which opened its doors in 1980 which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. Its classes offered transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English. The State University of Haiti (Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti in French or UEH), is located within the capital along other universities such as the Quisqueya University and the Universit\u00e9 des Cara\u00efbes. There are many other institutions that observe the Haitian scholastic program. Many of them are religious academies led by foreign missionaries from France or Canada. These include Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, \u00c9cole Sainte-Rose-de-Lima, \u00c9cole Saint-Jean-Marie Vianney, Institution du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, and Coll\u00e8ge Anne-Marie Javouhey.\nThe Ministry of Education is also located in downtown Port-au-Prince at the Palace of Ministries, adjacent to the National Palace in the Champ de Mars plaza.\nThe Haitian Group of Research and Pedagogical Activities (GHRAP) has set up several community centers for basic education. UNESCO's office at Port-au-Prince has taken a number of initiates in upgrading the educational facilities in Port-au-Prince.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nA 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in the capital Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012. In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.High-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix-des-Bouquets, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale 1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint-Louverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (\"American\") Road via Route Nationale 1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.In the Bel Air neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAll of the major transportation systems in Haiti are located near or run through the capital. The northern highway, Route Nationale #1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince.  The southern highway, Route Nationale #2 also runs through Port-au-Prince.  Maintenance for these roads lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to lend US$50 million designated for road repairs. The project was canceled in January 1999, however, after auditors revealed corruption. A third major highway, the Haitian Route Nationale #3, connects Port-au-Prince to the central plateau; however, due to its poor condition, it sees limited use.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called \"tap-taps.\"\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\nThe seaport, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the over dozen ports in the country.  The port's facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape.  The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees compared to ports in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nToussaint Louverture International Airport (Ma\u00efs G\u00e2t\u00e9), which opened in 1965 (as Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier International Airport), is north of the city. It is Haiti's major jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Transportation to smaller cities from the major airport is done via smaller aircraft. Companies providing this service include Caribintair and Sunrise Airways.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone\nFamous people from Port-au-Prince\nPort au Prince \u2013 a ship from the Age of Sail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nKolbe, Athena R.; Muggah, Robert (2012). \"\"Haiti's Urban Crime Wave?

        "wiki": "Asa Clapp (15 March 1762 - 17 April 1848) was an American merchant and politician.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nClapp was born to Abiel Clapp, an established farmer and town magistrate in Mansfield, Massachusetts. In 1787, Clapp married Eliza Wendell Quincy (died 1853, age 90) of Boston. She was the daughter of prominent physician Jacob Quincy and granddaughter of Boston merchant Edmund Quincy. Clapp was one of Portland's largest merchants at the time of his death. Several of his sons were also major merchants and were elected to political offices; Charles Q. Clapp, for whom the still-standing Charles Q. Clapp House and Charles Q. Clapp Block are named, one of them.  Another son, Asa W. H. Clapp, represented Maine's 2nd congressional district in the 30th United States Congress (1847-1849).\n\n\n== Career ==\nClapp was appointed a non-commissioned officer for the colonists during the American Revolution. After the war, Clapp worked as a sailor. He was present in Port au Prince at the beginning of the Haitian Revolution; he and Joseph Peabody assisted the white population against the formerly enslaved rebels. In 1793, Clapp was captured by British officials as part of the French Revolutionary Wars and detained in England for six months. He was eventually released and compensated for lost cargo. In 1796, he established himself as a merchant in Portland, Maine, which was then part of the state of Massachusetts. In December 1807, the U.S. Congress passed the Embargo Act of 1807, which forbid merchants like Clapp from trading abroad. Though disastrous to his financial interests and the New England shipping economy in general, Clapp supported the measure. In 1811, he served on the Massachusetts Governor's Council under Governor Elbridge Gerry. Clapp also supported the United States during the War of 1812 despite it severely hurting his business interests.\nWhen the Second Bank of the United States was chartered during the presidency of James Madison, Clapp was the largest subscriber in the District of Maine and was appointed Commissioner, though he did not maintain interest in the Bank for very long.\nA supporter of statehood, Clapp was a delegate to the October 1819 Maine statehood convention. After statehood was won, he served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1820\u20131823.\nClapp was a staunch Democrat and, at the age of 85 in 1847, briefly hosted President James K. Polk and Secretary of State James Buchanan during their visit to the city of Portland.\n\n\n== References ==",

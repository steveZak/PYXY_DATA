        "wiki": "Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park.\nWalt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.\nSince its opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972,  Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019. Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot.\nDisneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it inspired. According to a March 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees). Disney announced \"Project Stardust\" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the park to account for higher attendance numbers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== Origins ====\n\nThe concept for Disneyland began when Walt Disney was visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters Diane and Sharon. While watching them ride the merry-go-round, he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together, though his dream lay dormant for many years. He may have also been influenced by his father's memories of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago (his father worked at the Exposition). The Midway Plaisance there included a set of attractions representing various countries from around the world and others representing various periods of man; it also included many rides including the first Ferris wheel, a \"sky\" ride, a passenger train that circled the perimeter, and a Wild West Show. Another likely influence was Benton Harbor, Michigan's nationally famous House of David's Eden Springs Park. Disney visited the park and ultimately bought one of the older miniature trains originally used there; the colony had the largest miniature railway setup in the world at the time. The earliest documented draft of Disney's plans was sent as a memo to studio production designer Dick Kelsey on August 31, 1948, where it was referred to as a \"Mickey Mouse Park\", based on notes Disney made during his and Ward Kimball's trip to Chicago Railroad Fair the same month, with a two-day stop in\nHenry Ford's Museum and Greenfield Village, a place with attractions like a Main Street and steamboat rides, which he had visited eight years earlier.While people wrote letters to Disney about visiting the Walt Disney Studios, he realized that a functional movie studio had little to offer to visiting fans, and began to foster ideas of building a site near the Burbank studios for tourists to visit. His ideas evolved to a small play park with a boat ride and other themed areas. The initial concept, the Mickey Mouse Park, started with an eight-acre (3.2 ha) plot across Riverside Drive. He started to visit other parks for inspiration and ideas, including Tivoli Gardens in Denmark, Efteling in the Netherlands, and Greenfield Village, Playland, and Children's Fairyland in the United States; and (according to the film director Ken Annakin, in his autobiography 'So You want to be a film director?'), Bekonscot Model Village & Railway, Beaconsfield, England. His designers began working on concepts, though the project grew much larger than the land could hold. Disney hired Harrison Price from Stanford Research Institute to gauge the proper area to locate the theme park based on the area's potential growth. Based on Price's analysis (for which he would be recognized as a Disney Legend in 2003), Disney acquired 160 acres (65 ha) of orange groves and walnut trees in Anaheim, southeast of Los Angeles in neighboring Orange County. The Burbank site originally considered by Disney is now home to Walt Disney Animation Studios and ABC Studios.\nDifficulties in obtaining funding prompted Disney to investigate new methods of fundraising, and he decided to create a show named Disneyland. It was broadcast on then-fledgling ABC. In return, the network agreed to help finance the park. For its first five years of operation, Disneyland was owned by Disneyland, Inc., which was jointly owned by Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney, Western Publishing and ABC. In addition, Disney rented out many of the shops on Main Street, U.S.A. to outside companies. By 1960, Walt Disney Productions bought out all other shares, a partnership which would eventually lead to the Walt Disney Corporation's acquisition of ABC in the mid-1990s. Construction began on July 16, 1954 and cost $17 million to complete (equivalent to $129 million in 2018). The park was opened one year and one day later. U.S. Route 101 (later Interstate 5) was under construction at the same time just north of the site; in preparation for the traffic Disneyland was expected to bring, two more lanes were added to the freeway before the park was finished.\n\n\n==== Opening day ====\nDisneyland was dedicated at an \"International Press Preview\" event held on Sunday, July 17, 1955, which was open only to invited guests and the media. Although 28,000 people attended the event, only about half of those were invitees, the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets, or even sneaked into the park by climbing over the fence. The following day, it opened to the public, featuring twenty attractions. The Special Sunday events, including the dedication, were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney's friends from Hollywood: Art Linkletter, Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan. ABC broadcast the event live, during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables. In Frontierland, a camera caught Cummings kissing a dancer. When Disney started to read the plaque for Tomorrowland, he read partway then stopped when a technician off-camera said something to him, and after realizing he was on-air, said, \"I thought I got a signal\", and began the dedication from the start. At one point, while in Fantasyland, Linkletter tried to give coverage to Cummings, who was on the pirate ship. He was not ready, and tried to give the coverage back to Linkletter, who had lost his microphone. Cummings then did a play-by-play of him trying to find it in front of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.Traffic was delayed on the two-lane Harbor Boulevard. Famous figures who were scheduled to show up every two hours showed up all at once. The temperature was an unusually high 101 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), and because of a local plumbers' strike, Disney was given a choice of having working drinking fountains or running toilets. He chose the latter, leaving many drinking fountains dry. This generated negative publicity since Pepsi sponsored the park's opening; disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda, while other vendors ran out of food. The asphalt that had been poured that morning was soft enough to let women's high-heeled shoes sink into it. Some parents threw their children over the crowd's shoulders to get them onto rides, such as the King Arthur Carrousel. In later years, Disney and his 1955 executives referred to July 17, 1955, as \"Black Sunday\". After the extremely negative press from the preview opening, Walt Disney invited attendees back for a private \"second day\" to experience Disneyland properly.\nAt the time, and during the lifetimes of Walt and Roy Disney, July 17 was considered merely a preview, with July 18 the official opening day. Since then, aided by memories of the television broadcast, the company has adopted July 17 as the official date, the one commemorated every year as Disneyland's birthday.\n\n\n==== 1950s and 1960s ====\n\nIn September 1959, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev spent thirteen days in the United States, with two requests: to visit Disneyland and to meet John Wayne, Hollywood's top box-office draw. Due to the Cold War tension and security concerns, he was famously denied an excursion to Disneyland. The Shah of Iran and Empress Farah were invited to Disneyland by Walt Disney in the early 1960s. There was moderate controversy over the lack of African American employees. As late as 1963, civil rights activists were pressuring Disneyland to hire black people, with executives responding that they would \"consider\" the requests. The park did however hire people of Asian descent, such as Ty Wong and Bob Kuwahara.As part of the Casa de Fritos operation at Disneyland, \"Doritos\" (Spanish for \"little golden things\") were created at the park to recycle old tortillas that would have been discarded. The Frito-Lay Company saw the popularity of the item and began selling them regionally in 1964, and then nationwide in 1966.\n\n\n==== 1980s ====\nOn December 5, 1985, to celebrate Disneyland's 30th year in operation, one million balloons were launched along the streets bordering Disneyland as part of the Skyfest Celebration. They also remodeled Fantasyland.  They had to close in 1982 and, in 1983, a year after its closure, it reopened to the public as \"New Fantasyland\".\n\n\n==== 1990s ====\nIn the late 1990s, work began to expand the one-park, one-hotel property. Disneyland Park, the Disneyland Hotel, the site of the original parking lot, and acquired surrounding properties were earmarked to become part of the Disneyland Resort. At that time, the property saw the addition of the Disney California Adventure theme park, a shopping, dining and entertainment complex named Downtown Disney, a remodeled Disneyland Hotel, the construction of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, and the acquisition and re-branding of the Pan Pacific Hotel as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. The park was renamed \"Disneyland Park\" to distinguish it from the larger complex under construction. Because the existing parking lot (south of Disneyland) was repurposed by these projects, the six-level, 10,250-space Mickey and Friends parking structure was constructed in the northwest corner. Upon completion in 2000, it was the largest parking structure in the United States.The park's management team during the mid-1990s was a source of controversy among fans and employees. In an effort to boost profits, various changes were begun by then-executives Cynthia Harriss and Paul Pressler. While their initiatives provided a short-term increase in shareholder returns, they drew widespread criticism for their lack of foresight. The retail backgrounds of Harriss and Pressler led to a gradual shift in Disneyland's focus from attractions to merchandising. Outside consultants McKinsey & Company were brought in to help streamline operations, resulting in many changes and cutbacks. After nearly a decade of deferred maintenance, the original park was showing signs of neglect. Fans of the park decried the perceived decline in customer value and park quality and rallied for the dismissal of the management team.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMatt Ouimet, the former president of the Disney Cruise Line, was promoted to assume leadership of the Disneyland Resort in late 2003. Shortly afterward, he selected Greg Emmer as Senior Vice President of Operations. Emmer was a long-time Disney cast member who had worked at Disneyland in his youth prior to moving to Florida and held multiple executive leadership positions at the Walt Disney World Resort. Ouimet quickly set about reversing certain trends, especially concerning cosmetic maintenance and a return to the original infrastructure maintenance schedule, in hopes of restoring Disneyland's former safety record. Similarly to Disney himself, Ouimet and Emmer could often be seen walking the park during business hours with members of their respective staff, wearing cast member name badges, standing in line for attractions, and welcoming guests' comments. In July 2006, Ouimet left The Walt Disney Company to become president of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Soon after, Ed Grier, executive managing director of Walt Disney Attractions Japan, was named president of the resort. In October 2009, Grier announced his retirement, and was replaced by George Kalogridis.\nThe \"Happiest Homecoming on Earth\" was an eighteen-month-long celebration (held through 2005 and 2006) of the fiftieth anniversary of the Disneyland Park, also celebrating Disneyland's milestone throughout Disney parks worldwide. In 2004, the park underwent major renovations in preparation, restoring many attractions, notably Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. Attractions that had been in the park on opening day had one ride vehicle painted gold, and the park was decorated with fifty Golden Mickey Ears. The celebration started on May 5, 2005, and ended on September 30, 2006, and was followed by the \"Year of a Million Dreams\" celebration, lasting twenty-seven months and ending on December 31, 2008.\nBeginning on January 1, 2010, Disney Parks hosted the Give a Day, Get a Disney Day volunteer program, in which Disney encouraged people to volunteer with a participating charity and receive a free Disney Day at either a Disneyland Resort or Walt Disney World park. On March 9, 2010, Disney announced that it had reached its goal of one million volunteers and ended the promotion to anyone who had not yet registered and signed up for a specific volunteer situation.\nIn July 2015, Disneyland celebrated its 60th Diamond Celebration anniversary. Disneyland Park introduced the Paint the Night parade and Disneyland Forever fireworks show, and Sleeping Beauty Castle is decorated in diamonds with a large \"60\" logo. The Diamond Celebration concluded in September 2016 and the whole decoration of the anniversary was removed around Halloween 2016.\nDisneyland, along with Disney California Adventure, was closed indefinitely starting March 14, 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n== Lands ==\n\nDisneyland Park consists of nine themed \"lands\" and a number of concealed backstage areas, and occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) with the new addition of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway that's coming to Mickeys Toontown in 2022. The park opened with Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland, and has since added New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now known as Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019. In 1957, Holidayland opened to the public with a nine-acre (3.6 ha) recreation area including a circus and baseball diamond, but was closed in late 1961. It is often referred to as the \"lost\" land of Disneyland. Throughout the park are \"Hidden Mickeys\", representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor. An elevated berm supports the 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that circumnavigates the park.\n\nLands of Disneyland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main Street, U.S.A. ===\n\nMain Street, U.S.A. is patterned after a typical Midwest town of the early 20th century, and took much inspiration from Walt Disney's hometown, Marceline, Missouri. Main Street, U.S.A. has a train station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse with a steam-powered pump engine, emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker bus, horse-drawn streetcar, and jitneys. Main Street is also home to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show featuring an Audio-Animatronic version of the president. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Partners statue, and the Central Plaza (also known as the Hub), which is a portal to most of the themed lands: the entrance to Fantasyland is by way of a drawbridge across a moat and through the castle. Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland are on both sides of the castle. Several lands are not directly connected to the Central Plaza\u2014namely, New Orleans Square, Critter Country, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Mickey's Toontown.\nThe design of Main Street, U.S.A. uses the technique of forced perspective to create an illusion of height. Buildings along Main Street are built at \u200b3\u20444 scale on the first level, then \u200b5\u20448 on the second story, and \u200b1\u20442 scale on the third\u2014reducing the scale by \u200b1\u20448 each level up.\n\n\n=== Adventureland ===\n\nAdventureland is designed to recreate the feel of an exotic tropical place in a far-off region of the world. \"To create a land that would make this dream reality\", said Walt Disney, \"we pictured ourselves far from civilization, in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa.\" Attractions include opening day's Jungle Cruise, the Indiana Jones Adventure, and Tarzan's Treehouse, which is a conversion of Swiss Family Treehouse from the Walt Disney film Swiss Family Robinson. Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room which is located at the entrance to Adventureland was the first feature attraction to employ Audio-Animatronics, a computer synchronization of sound and robotics.\n\n\n=== New Orleans Square ===\n\nNew Orleans Square is based on 19th-century New Orleans, opened on July 24, 1966. It is home to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion, with nighttime entertainment in Fantasmic!. This area is the home of Club 33.\n\n\n=== Frontierland ===\n\nFrontierland recreates the setting of pioneer days along the American frontier. According to Walt Disney, \"All of us have cause to be proud of our country's history, shaped by the pioneering spirit of our forefathers. Our adventures are designed to give you the feeling of having lived, even for a short while, during our country's pioneer days.\" Frontierland is home to the Pinewood Indians band of animatronic Native Americans, who live on the banks of the Rivers of America. Entertainment and attractions include Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, the Mark Twain Riverboat, the Sailing Ship Columbia, Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, and Frontierland Shootin' Exposition. Frontierland is also home to the Golden Horseshoe Saloon, an Old West-style show palace.\n\n\n=== Critter Country ===\n\nCritter Country opened in 1972 as \"Bear Country\", and was renamed in 1988. Formerly the area was home to Indian Village, where indigenous tribespeople demonstrated their dances and other customs. Today, the main draw of the area is Splash Mountain, a log-flume journey inspired by the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris and the animated segments of Disney's Academy Award-winning 1946 film Song of the South. In 2003, a dark ride called The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh replaced the Country Bear Jamboree, which closed in 2001. Country Bear Jamboree is still open in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge ===\n\nStar Wars: Galaxy's Edge is set within the Star Wars universe, in the Black Spire Outpost village on the remote frontier planet of Batuu. Attractions include the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. The land opened in 2019, replacing Big Thunder Ranch and former backstage areas.\n\n\n=== Fantasyland ===\n\nFantasyland is the area of Disneyland of which Walt Disney said, \"What youngster has not dreamed of flying with Peter Pan over moonlit London, or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical Wonderland? In Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become realities for youngsters \u2013 of all ages \u2013 to participate in.\" Fantasyland was originally styled in a medieval European fairground fashion, but its 1983 refurbishment turned it into a Bavarian village. Attractions include several dark rides, the King Arthur Carrousel, and various family attractions. Fantasyland has the most fiber optics in the park; more than half of them are in Peter Pan's Flight. Sleeping Beauty's Castle features a walk-through story telling of Briar Rose's adventure as Sleeping Beauty. The attraction opened in 1959, was redesigned in 1972, closed in 1992 for reasons of security and the new installation of pneumatic ram firework shell mortars for \"Believe, There's Magic in the Stars\", and reopened 2008 with new renditions and methods of storytelling and the restored work of Eyvind Earle.\n\n\n=== Mickey's Toontown ===\n\nMickey's Toontown opened in 1993 and was partly inspired by the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Toontown in the Touchstone Pictures 1988 release Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Mickey's Toontown is based on a 1930s cartoon aesthetic and is home to Disney's most popular cartoon characters. Toontown features two main attractions: Gadget's Go Coaster and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. The \"city\" is also home to cartoon character's houses such as the house of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and Goofy, as well as Donald Duck's boat. The 3 ft (914 mm) gauge Jolly Trolley can also be found in this area, though it closed as an attraction in 2003 and is now present only for display purposes. In 2022 Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway will open at Mickey's Toontown. The new family friendly dark ride will increase the size of Toontown as well as the size of Disneyland from 99 to 101 acres (40 to 41 ha).\n\n\n=== Tomorrowland ===\n\nDuring the 1955 inauguration Walt Disney dedicated Tomorrowland with these words: \"Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today are opening the doors of the Space Age to achievements that will benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future.\"\nDisneyland producer Ward Kimball had rocket scientists Wernher von Braun, Willy Ley, and Heinz Haber serve as technical consultants during the original design of Tomorrowland. Initial attractions included Rocket to the Moon, Astro-Jets and Autopia; later, the first incarnation of the Submarine Voyage was added. The area underwent a major transformation in 1967 to become New Tomorrowland, and then again in 1998 when its focus was changed to present a \"retro-future\" theme reminiscent of the illustrations of Jules Verne.\nCurrent attractions include Space Mountain, Star Wars Launch Bay, Autopia, Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple, the Disneyland Monorail Tomorrowland Station, Astro Orbitor, and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage opened on June 11, 2007, resurrecting the original Submarine Voyage which closed in 1998. Star Tours was closed in July 2010 and replaced with Star Tours\u2013The Adventures Continue in June 2011.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Backstage ===\nMajor buildings backstage include the Frank Gehry-designed Team Disney Anaheim, where most of the division's administration currently works, as well as the Old Administration Building, behind Tomorrowland.\nPhotography is forbidden in these areas, both inside and outside, although some photos have found their way to a variety of web sites. Guests who attempt to explore backstage are warned and often escorted from the property.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nWalt Disney had a longtime interest in transportation, and trains in particular. Disney's passion for the \"iron horse\" led to him building a miniature live steam backyard railroad\u2014the \"Carolwood Pacific Railroad\"\u2014on the grounds of his Holmby Hills estate. Throughout all the iterations of Disneyland during the 17 or so years when Disney was conceiving it, one element remained constant: a train encircling the park. The primary designer for the park transportation vehicles was Bob Gurr who gave himself the title of Director of Special Vehicle Design in 1954.Encircling Disneyland and providing a grand circle tour is the Disneyland Railroad (DRR), a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge short-line railway consisting of five oil-fired and steam-powered locomotives, in addition to three passenger trains and one passenger-carrying freight train. Originally known as the Disneyland and Santa Fe Railroad, the DRR was presented by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway until 1974. From 1955 to 1974, the Santa Fe Rail Pass was accepted in lieu of a Disneyland \"D\" coupon. With a 3 ft (914 mm) gauge, the most common narrow track gauge used in North America, the track runs in a continuous loop around Disneyland through each of its realms. Each 1900s-era train departs Main Street Station on an excursion that includes scheduled station stops at: New Orleans Square Station; Toontown Depot; and Tomorrowland Station. The Grand Circle Tour then concludes with a visit to the \"Grand Canyon/Primeval World\" dioramas before returning passengers to Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nOne of Disneyland's signature attractions is its Disneyland Monorail System monorail service, which opened in Tomorrowland in 1959 as the first daily-operating monorail train system in the Western Hemisphere. The monorail guideway has remained almost exactly the same since 1961, aside from small alterations while Indiana Jones Adventure was being built. Five generations of monorail trains have been used in the park, since their lightweight construction means they wear out quickly. The most recent operating generation, the Mark VII, was installed in 2008. The monorail shuttles visitors between two stations, one inside the park in Tomorrowland and one in Downtown Disney. It follows a 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km) route designed to show the park from above. Currently, the Mark VII is running with the colors red, blue and orange. The monorail was originally a loop built with just one station in Tomorrowland. Its track was extended and a second station opened at the Disneyland Hotel in 1961. With the creation of Downtown Disney in 2001, the new destination is Downtown Disney, instead of the Disneyland Hotel. The physical location of the monorail station did not change, but the original station building was demolished as part of the hotel downsizing, and the new station is now separated from the hotel by several Downtown Disney buildings, including ESPN Zone and the Rainforest Caf\u00e9.\n\nAll of the vehicles found on Main Street, U.S.A., grouped together as the Main Street Vehicles attraction, were designed to accurately reflect turn-of-the-century vehicles, including a 3 ft (914 mm) gauge tramway featuring horse-drawn streetcars, a double-decker bus, a fire engine, and an automobile. They are available for one-way rides along Main Street, U.S.A. The horse-drawn streetcars are also used by the park entertainment, including The Dapper Dans. The horseless carriages are modeled after cars built in 1903, and are two-cylinder, four-horsepower (3 kW) engines with manual transmission and steering. Walt Disney used to drive the fire engine around the park before it opened, and it has been used to host celebrity guests and in the parades. Most of the original main street vehicles were designed by Bob Gurr.\nFrom the late 1950s to 1968, Los Angeles Airways provided regularly scheduled helicopter passenger service between Disneyland and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and other cities in the area. The helicopters initially operated from Anaheim/Disneyland Heliport, located behind Tomorrowland. Service later moved, in 1960, to a new heliport north of the Disneyland Hotel. Arriving guests were transported to the Disneyland Hotel via tram. The service ended after two fatal crashes in 1968: The crash in Paramount, California, on May 22, 1968, killed 23 (the worst helicopter accident in aviation history at that time). The second crash in Compton, California on August 14, 1968, killed 21.\n\n\n=== Live entertainment ===\n\nIn addition to the attractions, Disneyland provides live entertainment throughout the park. Most of the mentioned entertainment is not offered daily, but only on selected days of the week, or selected periods of the year.\nMany Disney characters can be found throughout the park, greeting visitors, interacting with children, and posing for photos. Some characters have specific areas where they are scheduled to appear, but can be found wandering as well. Some of the rarest are characters like Rabbit (from Winnie-the-Pooh), Max, Mushu, and Agent P. Periodically through recent decades (and most recently during the summers of 2005 and 2006), Mickey Mouse would climb the Matterhorn attraction several times a day with the support of Minnie, Goofy, and other performers. Other mountain climbers could also be seen on the Matterhorn from time to time. As of March 2007, Mickey and his \"toon\" friends no longer climb the Matterhorn but the climbing program continues. Every evening at dusk, there is a military-style flag retreat to lower the U.S. Flag by a ceremonial detail of Disneyland's Security staff. The ceremony is usually held between 4:00 and 5:00 pm, depending on the entertainment being offered on Main Street, U.S.A., to prevent conflicts with crowds and music. Disney does report the time the Flag Retreat is scheduled on its Times Guide, offered at the entrance turnstiles and other locations. The Disneyland Band, which has been part of the park since its opening, plays the role of the Town Band on Main Street, U.S.A. It also breaks out into smaller groups like the Main Street Strawhatters, the Hook and Ladder Co., and the Pearly Band in Fantasyland. However, on March 31, 2015, the Disneyland Resort notified the band members of an \"end of run\". The reason for doing so is that they would start a new higher energy band. The veteran band members were invited to audition for the new Disneyland band, and were told that even if they did not make the new band or audition, they would still play in small groups around the park. This sparked some controversy with supporters of the traditional band.\n\n\n==== Parades ====\nDisneyland has featured a number of different parades traveling down the park's central Main Street \u2013 Fantasyland corridor. There have been daytime and nighttime parades that celebrated Disney films or seasonal holidays with characters, music, and large floats. One of the most popular parades was the Main Street Electrical Parade, which recently ended a limited-time return engagement after an extended run at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. From May 5, 2005 through November 7, 2008, as part of Disneyland's 50th anniversary, Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams was presented, celebrating several Disney films including The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland, and Pinocchio. In 2009, Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams was replaced by Celebrate! A Street Party, which premiered on March 27, 2009. Disney did not call Celebrate! A Street Party a parade, but rather a \"street event.\" During the Christmas season, Disneyland presents \"A Christmas Fantasy\" Parade. Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams was replaced by Mickey's Soundsational Parade, which debuted on May 27, 2011. Disneyland debuted a new nighttime parade called \"Paint the Night\", on May 22, 2015, as part of the park's 60th anniversary.\n\n\n==== Fireworks shows ====\n\nElaborate fireworks shows synchronized with Disney songs and often have appearances from Tinker Bell (and other characters) flying in the sky above Sleeping Beauty Castle. Since 2000, presentations have become more elaborate, featuring new pyrotechnics, launch techniques, and story lines. In 2004, Disneyland introduced a new air launch pyrotechnics system, reducing ground level smoke and noise and decreasing negative environmental impacts. At the time the technology debuted, Disney announced it would donate the patents to a non-profit organization for use throughout the industry.

In Holiday Magic\nLimited edition fireworks shows\n60th Anniversary: Disneyland Forever\nPixar Fest: Together Forever\nGet Your Ears On \u2013 A Mickey and Minnie Celebration: Mickey's Mix MagicSince 2009, Disneyland has moved to a rotating repertoire of firework spectaculars.\nScheduling of fireworks shows depends on the time of year. During the slower off-season periods, the fireworks are only offered on weekends. During the busier times, Disney offers additional nights. The park offers fireworks nightly during its busy periods, which include Easter/Spring Break, Summer and Christmas time. Disneyland spends about $41,000 per night on the fireworks show. The show is normally offered at 8:45 or 9:30 pm if the park is scheduled to close at 10 pm or later, but shows have started as early as 5:45 pm. A major consideration is weather/winds, especially at higher elevations, which can, and often will, force the delay or cancellation of the show. In response to this, alternate versions of the fireworks spectaculars have been created in recent years, solely using the projections and lighting effects. With a few minor exceptions, such as July 4 and New Year's Eve, shows must finish by 10:00 pm due to the conditions of the permit issued by the City of Anaheim.\nIn recent years, Disneyland uses smaller and mid-sized fireworks shells and more low-level pyrotechnics on the castle to allow guests to enjoy the fireworks spectaculars even if there is a weather issue such as high wind. This precedent is known as B-show. The first fireworks show to have this format was Believe... In Holiday Magic from the 2018 holiday season.\n\n\n=== Attendance ===\n\n\n=== Tickets ===\n\nFrom Disneyland's opening day until 1982, the price of the attractions was in addition to the price of park admission. Guests paid a small admission fee to get into the park, but admission to most of the rides and attractions required guests to purchase tickets, either individually or in a book, that consisted of several coupons, initially labeled \"A\" through \"C\". \"A\" coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the Main Street Vehicles, whereas \"C\" coupons were used for the most common attractions like Peter Pan's Flight, or the Mad Tea Party. As more thrilling rides were introduced, such as the Disneyland Monorail or the Matterhorn Bobsleds, \"D\" and then eventually \"E\" coupons were introduced. Coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket (e.g., two \"A\" tickets equal one \"B\" ticket).\nDisneyland later featured a \"Keys to the Kingdom\" booklet of tickets, which consisted of 10 unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate. These coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value.\nIn 1982, Disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets to a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions, \"except shooting galleries\". While this idea was not original to Disney, it had business advantages: in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid the same entry amount regardless of their length of stay or number of rides ridden, the park no longer had to print ride tickets, provide staff for ticket booths, nor provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets. Later, Disney introduced other entry options such as multi-day passes, Annual Passes (which allow unlimited entry to the Park for an annual fee), and Southern California residents' discounts.\nOn February 28, 2016, Disneyland adopted a demand-based pricing system for single-day admission, charging different prices for \"value\", \"regular\", and \"peak\" days, based on projected attendance. Approximately 30% of days will be designated as \"value\", mainly weekdays when school is in session, 44% will be designated as \"regular\", and 26% will be designated as \"peak\", mostly during holidays and weekends in July.\n^*  Before 1982, passport tickets were available to groups only.\n\nSee or edit raw graph data.\n\n\n=== Closures ===\nDisneyland has had six unscheduled closures:\n\nIn 1963, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\nIn 1970, due to an anti-Vietnam riot instigated by the Youth International Party.\nIn 1987, on December 16 due to a winter storm.\nIn 1994, for inspection after the Northridge earthquake.\nIn 2001, after the September 11 attacks.\nIn 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; ongoing as of May 2020.Additionally, Disneyland has had numerous planned closures:\n\nIn the early years, the park was often scheduled to be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays during the off-season. This was in conjunction with nearby Knott's Berry Farm, which closed on Wednesdays and Thursdays to keep costs down for both parks, while offering Orange County visitors a place to go 7 days a week.\nOn May 4, 2005, for the 50th Anniversary Celebration media event.\nThe park has closed early to accommodate various special events, such as special press events, tour groups, VIP groups, and private parties. It is common for a corporation to rent the entire park for the evening. In such cases, special passes are issued which are valid for admission to all rides and attractions. At the ticket booths and on published schedules, regular guests are notified of the early closures. In the late afternoon, cast members announce that the park is closing, then clear the park of everyone without the special passes.\n\n\n=== Promotions ===\nEvery year in October, Disneyland has a Halloween promotion. During this promotion, or as Disneyland calls it a \"party\", areas in the park are decorated in a Halloween theme. Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion are temporarily re-themed as part of the promotion. A Halloween party is offered on selected nights in late September and October for a separate fee, with a special fireworks show that is only shown at the party.\nFrom early November until the beginning of January, the park is decorated for the holidays. Seasonal entertainment includes the Believe... In Holiday Magic firework show and A Christmas Fantasy Parade, while the Haunted Mansion and It's a Small World are temporarily redecorated in a holiday theme. The Sleeping Beauty Castle is also known to become snow-capped and decorated with colorful lights during the holidays as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Disney theme park attractions\nList of Disney attractions that were never built\nIncidents at Disneyland Resort\nRail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\nDapper Day\nC.

          "Compared to Orlando, this is rd half the size and seems double the people. Road there was awful and slow, much most of LA freeways. The Star Wars was the highlight and rest was so so. Problem was too many people and we went on a not crowded day! Not worth the money - go to",

          "We've been to several Disney Parks around the globe and there is something special about Disneyland. Our favorite is the Haunted Mansion Holiday. If you are a Nightmare Before Christmas fan you just have to visit at Halloween!",
          "I am a big fan of Disney World and was therefore slightly worried that the original would underwhelm. However there were enough differences between traditional rides at both parks to make it special and some unique things that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. We were lucky that it",
          "I give 5 stars and yet entitle my review \u201cDisappointed\u201d because my visit was so full of contradictions. So many contradictions because throughout the entire experience; the staff were impeccable. Truly amazing. Never letting the brand down for a second and I\u2019m not talking about",
          "Was nice to return to Disneyland and our first time without kids. There was a lot of changes to the park since our last visit including the new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge area. Was nice to also ride the classics like Peter Pan, Jungle Cruise, and the Disneyland Railroad. The park",

          "I visited the park when I was a child around 10 years old. They have added so much it is absolutely amazing. We took our kids for thier first time. We spent 4 days in the park and could have spent a few more just to get to those rides we liked or never got to go to. There is",

          "The employee was quite rude to me. I went single rider, and i accidentally threw away the single rider ticket. Then the employee told me \"get it out of the recycling right now\" and so I tried and told her I couldn't then I walked away. The she called me a \"brat\" behind my back",
          "My family and I visit annually and drive 6 hrs in order to do so. March 10th was a rainy day, which we planned for. But the wait to get into the park theough security was absurd. I appreciate the safety measures but you have to design the entrance to keep things moving smoothly.",
          "Celebrated our daughters 1st birthday and our sons 4th birthday at the happiest place on earth during the corona virus apocalypse. It was very clean. We felt safe. And the longest wait was 45min which is unheard of for a Saturday. Galaxy Edge Star Wars land was our favorite.",

          "It\u2019s an experience but honestly who will wait 1 hour in line for each attraction. Better to just walk around and eat. Had the best ceasar salad of my life here.",
          "We got though the park entrance by 8:30am and proceeded to get our boarding pass for the Star Wars ride and got group 141. In other words, come back tomorrow around 6am..... So crazy! We're going to have to wait a few years when the craziness is over. The Millennium Falcon ride",

          "As always, a perfect day. Wait times were minimal. Make sure you see the Lincoln show. Everyone should visit the show and learn about our history. If you know the history, this is a good refresher. Very moving presentation.",
          "Get ready for crowds and long lines for the rides and attractions. It was worth it to get the Max Pass, but there's a bit of a learning curve to use it with your smart phone. You have to use the Disney app and the availability is limited but we got to ride on about 5 more rides",
          "Well what to say? At age 47 I finally managed to make it to the house of mouse. Certainly some things lived up to the hype while others were a bit meh! As Star Wars tragics first stop was galaxys edge. The line for the millennium falcon ride was 1 1/2 hours. It was an amazing",
          "Fantastic family trip for all ages. The fast pass helps with time management, and allows you to explore and head towards your preferred ride without guessing. We will be back for sure! 2-3days is ideal to get the full experience.",
          "We went to the first weekend of the festival in the California Park. It was so crowded, we had to wait in line for all food to taste. Last year we went in April and it was much better. Its a wonderful fun event. Will try and make it an annual trip.",
          "We went to the park during Covid 19 scare and it slightly caused smaller lines. We were able to get a boarding group for Starwars Rise of the Resistance which if you don't get one when the park opens, they are gone in seconds. The rides are nice and the park is kept very",
          "First visit to DL. Love WDW. I paid for the max pass with the free photos. I did find it hard to find the professional photographers as compared to WDW. I felt a little let down. Also with WDW, the rides have cool videos with you on the ride, not here. I did get on the Rise of",

          "Really recomend to go on weekdays and purchase Max Pass so you can get fast track on your phone. Also set up alarm on your phone so you can select the new fast track as soon as it is available",
          "It never gets old. This time it was just the wife and I and we had the ticket that let us get fast track online so no walking back and forth. It was worth it!",

          "A dream vacation included Disney. Allow enough time as the lines are long. Be sure to take advantage of the quick pass option, as this really helps. The most amazing ride is the new Star Wars. Totally interactive and real. The food is expensive, so we brought in a picnic lunch.",

Normally this place is immaculate and that\u2019s why we come back. Also, normally the cast members are over the top friendly. Most were this",

          "Unfortunately, because of the Corona Virus, my plans to go to a business conference was cancelled. I had initially purchased a ticket to Disneyland for one night while I was there. I was simply asking for a Disney Gift Card, if they couldn't give me a refund, since I live on",
          "Traveled to the park for our anniversary. Spent two days. The new Star Wars ride is amazing ( we are not big Star Wars fans) what a great attraction. Enjoyed many of the classics. Always love the Peter Pan Flight & Mr. Toads Wild Ride. Spent a little more time in the",
          "Normally I am not a fan of change to my favorite park but I must say that the new rides, parade and changes are all very enjoyable and keep the park feeling fresh. It's still one of my favorite destinations and with some pre-planning is a wonderful vacation.",
          "For what Disneyland charges to walk through the gates, not to mention what they charge for annual passes and parking, the least the cast members can do is to be friendly and courteous at The Happiest Place on Earth. The ONLY kind and friendly cast members we encountered on our",
          "My husband and I spent 1 1/2 days here for President\u2019s Day weekend in February. We live on the east coast and have been to WDW several times. This was our first visit to DL. It was such a fun weekend! We went to DL on Friday around 3 pm, went to Disney California Adventure on",
          "Flew from nz and stopped off only as I wanted to do Disneyland Star Wars land and do the two new rides . Star Wars land cool but if you think you will be able to do Rise of the resistance you will be very disappointed . You can\u2019t buy fast passes , you have to pay park entry",
          "Took my 12 y/o son and his friend for the first time, spending the first day at Disneyland and the second day at California Adventure. I had not been in 25 years so I spent a lot of time researching and planning because I knew nothing about fastpass or maxpass. Turns out that if",
          "This was my family's fifth trip to Disneyland and I have to say I was very disappointed. Disney used to be all about the guest experience and now it is clear that it is all about making as much money as possible. Cast members used to be friendly but now the focus is more on",
          "Everytime I go I enjoy myself whether it be with my kids or on an Adult BFF trip! the smells the sights and the rides I love every minute of it",
          "Overpriced, overrun with people, but it is what it is- fun place for kids and kids at heart. Price of entry and food is always very frustrating but they will continue to charge it if people keep coming in droves. The positive is they try to manage the crowds and make it somewhat",
          "Been there, seen it, done it, got the t-shirt & Mickey ears. The park is split across 2 sites next to each other both costing a fee to enter even with a discount code you are looking at $100+ pp per day. You will need at least a day to go round each park. Everything is way",
          "From small children to senior citizens enjoying themselves in Disneyland Park. Most rides are less scary and suitable for all ages.",
          "This was the second time I've been here and this time was extremely busy. The new Starwars ride was sold out, the lineups were so long, the food was expensive, and the staff really aren't as friendly as I have heard they are supposed to be. The Max Pass can definitely be",
          "We love this place. We are going to buy an annual pass. We went on the Showboat, Jungle Cruise,Astro Blaster, Manorail, Disneyland Railroad and more. We always live those Disneyland Ice Pops with the Mickey Ears. It\u2019s so much fun!",
          "No hiding the fact that Disneyland was very busy this past week. With everyone trying to get boarding passes for ROR. the fates were lined up all the way to DCA entrance on Wednesday an hour ahead of park opening. Then everyone rushes in and sits on their phones just waiting for",
          "Been coming here since the early 70s as a toddler. Moved away to another state in the 80s but began taking annual trips here with my two children starting around 7-8 years ago. In that span of time it\u2019s been pretty consistent as far as quality, crowds, customer service, etc. Not",
          "Disneyland has been around for decades. Some of the rides are showing their age, but technology is well used at the park. The Disney app is a great way to see how long the waits are, whether fast pass is available and also the only way to currently queue for the newest \"Rise",

          "So, Disneyland. I've been going there since a few years after it opened. I love the place--there's always something new to do and see. The prices are trough the roof and everywhere you turn they are trying to sell you something or make your kids guilt you into something. But . .",
          "My adult daughter and I got the 4-day Park Hopper and it was just right. The two parks have their own charm, and a good variety of rides and experiences between them. The new Galaxy's Edge land is visually stunning. Still some glitches on Rise of the Resistance: we tried each",
          "Disneyland never disappoints unless it has a rainstorm. Which is rare. It is so beautiful, the attention to detail is amazing, love the foliage, the landscaping, the artistry. The rides are just so cool and every year they get better! I do hate it when something is taken out,",
          "This was our 3rd visit and it\u2019s still just amazing. Disney is expensive but worth it. So much entertainment for one day. Wait times for February are short and we still couldn\u2019t do it all in one day. 2 for Disney and 1 for California Adventure minimum.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the happiest place on the earth! It was wonderful! Disney does a great job in hiring their princesses, characters and even the food court staff! Everyone was so accomodating, happy, patient, and helpful during our visit. The time was very magical! Don' t",
          "This review is my subjective opinion. I was very disappointed with our fall vacation to Disneyland. It's been a few years since we've been, and it's really changed for the worse in my opinion. Large groups of people (6 or more people) were constantly cutting in line. This",

          "Disneyland has changed dramatically. I remember happy quaint park. Now too crowded Spent more time walking and waiting hours for rides.Got on a few rides even with fast passes in four days.We got very little accomplished in four days. Miss the days of characters roaming.",
          "Truly was the best part of our trip to LA and you have probably read lots of reviews so i will try and give you tips rather than just gushing. First of all make sure you download Disney App and bring a powerbank because your phone will defintiely run out of battery! Get there",
          "My wife and I have been to every Disney Park in the world, and our son had been to all of them except California, so... It had been a while since we had been to Disneyland ourselves - we had never seen Cars Land in DCA, and there\u2019s Galaxy Edge of course - but we were really",
          "Wow factor included on-line app, FastPass and mobile dining ordering. Lines did not feel long due to constant movement and activity at SpaceMountain and new Millineum Falcon. Boarding pass system for Resistance ride was a novel concept",

          "This was our first to Disneyland in the past few years. The lines moved quickly leading up to the ticket counter. The cast member didn\u2019t seem all that excited, which was disappointing as a first impression. Security was very quick, though the entry line took the longest;",
          "We spent five days at the park and had a great time. If you need reservations for anything, do it in advance such as the Blue Bayou. The max pass with the fast pass worked out well. If you want to ride the New Star Wars ride, you must get in the park, find a place to sit, and",
          "What happened to the classic Disneyland? It seems like they just want to cash in nowadays. What happened to the days when the employees were in character, and friendly? We even talked to Mary Poppins and she scowled at us and said whatever it was she said and kept walking while",
          "After having visited the Disney parks in Orlando, Paris, Tokyo and Hongkong we finally made it to Disneyland. We had a great time. Both the parks are worth a visit and the waiting times in February were very bearable. It's a beautiful park in line with its sister parks all over",
          "Unless you are staying in the park, have an early season - it\u2019s impossible. We were in the park at 8am, booked to to attend the ride to be informed , via the app, we were group 133 / stand by. They only cater for 70-80 groups per day. Whilst I am on, never have I met such rude",
          "We took our little family here for five days and had so much fun. There is something for every age. The prices are a bit high for a family but they do not disappoint. I highly recommend the Disney App. Do not bother with magic mornings. Christmas time is so beautiful",
          "My family was very disappointed that even though Disneyland park was not very busy we still could not get on the new star wars ride \"rise of the resistance\". We payed extra to have the maxx passes and even though we got into the park as soon as it opened and had the Disney app",
          "Since adding Star Wars themed attractions, Disneyland has become to busy. It worries me to bring my young grandchildren and it has lost most of it's Magic. I know it is necessary to bring new attractions, but It is a lot of money to pay to stand in endless lines.",
          "I love Disneyland but it has gotten a little too expensive for our whole family to travel to the Happiest Place On Earth together. We some how manage to scrape together the funds. It really bothers me that I pay for entrance to the park and then I am expected to pay more to",
          "What can be said about Disneyland that has not already been said. An attraction for children of all ages. If you are wanting to get boarding for the star wars ride you need to be in the park grounds before opening. This can cause some aggressive visitors trying to push their way",
          "This was probably our 3rd or 4th trip to Disney and our first where we did a three day park hopper with max pass. I am always impressed with the details and passion that have gone into building the park. To think of what it must have taken to build and develop it over the",

          "Return visit to Disneyland to see the new Star Wars ride. Unfortunately our hotel did not let us know that you had to book ahead to get a boarding pass for Star Wars. We spent $200 on a park hopper but on arrival signs were up saying all Star Wars booking passes gone.",
          "Been coming to Disneyland for over 35 years and now bring my young kids with my husband. We've been season pass holders since 1989 but finally let the passes go due to this park becoming unbearable. I feel for families coming from long distances dropping$1k a day for some",
          "I always wanted to do Disneyland at news years And we did this time. Besides having to wait in a spot for three hours for the. Fireworks, and the crowds, it is truly the happiest places on earth. No drink idiots, no drugs, just happy families/ people all around My fourth time",
          "We took 3 kids, ages 10, 9, and 7. One day in each park is plenty, we went on all the major rides multiple times. Definitely pack lunches and snacks! Cars land was incredible - the movie come to life!! World of color show was very magical (but why did they choose mufasa's death",
          "What can I say about Disney Land ... ITS AMAZING !!! I walked out of this place rubbing my cheeks as it hurt from smiling so much . The Fozen show was my absolute favourite thing with its snow falling from the ceiling and gorgeous cast . All the characters everywhere were",
          "Last visited Disneyland 30 years ago. The place is ten times better now. We spent 4 days / 4 nights and still didn't see everything. Stunning. It's a true treat for visitors coming far from overseas. Wish we had longer to stay. Never seen a ride like 'Rise of the Resistance'",
          "I was here in late January. There was no crowd. On and off all the rides quite quickly. Loved Indiana Jones, the Jungle Cruise, Pirates, and Buzz. The Haunted Mansion was closed for repair. A nice day.",
          "Came here while in the area for a conference and it was perfect for a night out. Not an overly huge park so it is something you could do in a day. We came with a family who has a 4 year old and she had a blast. The new Star Wars area is very well done and was really fun. the",
          "I go to Disneyland every year and it\u2019s amazing. Good thing we live in so cal and can go whenever we want. Prices keep raising but eh what can you do.",
          "Had a great fun day with my family excellent fun for all. My ten year old grandson was a good age as he could go on all the rides, a great holiday for all the family",
          "I picked this day to go to Disneyland because all of the websites visited said the last week in January on a T-Th would be very light. It wasn't. It was still crowded when close to closing time. I love Disneyland, but I think I'm done with this place. Its just not worth it.",
          "Second trip to Disneyland and still havent seen it all. 5 day pass. Too much to see and do which is GREAT. The little things you learn like how each ride slightly changes each time especially Indiana Jones. Loved the rides, the food, the shopping and just generally everything.",
          "Took my Star Wars crazy 16 year old and had a ball. We went in the first week of the new Rise of the Resistance ride and got in the virtual queue both days...you do need to be physically in the park at 9am though to achieve that which really meant queuing from 7am (we were there",
          "Great for all the family some lines were long, but overall not too bad, we went on a weekday,weekends are busier",
          "The shuttle service to the hotel can be confusing because it\u2019s going to be 12+ hours when you return and you\u2019ll be exhausted. If you remember, you likely have a photographic memory. The exit is much better than leaving Orlando. Staff is always super nice. Engaging. Helpful.",
          "My best friend and I went to Disneyland on a girl's trip. Park was crowded, but lines moved quickly. We were able to get on most rides within 15 minutes. Food in park is expensive, but very good. We had an amazing time!",
          "The longest we stood in line was at the older rides because they did not have max pass. Everywhere else, maybe 15 min. Sometimes no wait at all. Magic mornings were not worth it. If anything, on magic mornings, i would recommend going to the park that does not have it",
          "We got the 3 day park hopper pass. I would recommend getting the max pass and using the Disney app to avoid long lines. We heard a lot of mixed reviews about the new Rise of the Resistance ride. It is tricky to actually get on the ride but we really loved it! My 10 year old",
          "We did both parks in one day with the skip the line pass. If you want to visit every store there you need a week. Did all the rides at adventure land by 11 am then went accross to Disneyland, took a bit longer but still had time to go back as adventure land had better rides,",
          "We last visited Disneyland in 2012. We spent 3 days in the park with our kids who were teenagers. It was a truly magical experience. As a retailer, I recall walking away marvelled at the consistency of the service experience and training that must have sat behind. It seemed like",
          "We just returned from our kids first trip and left amazed! The park carries a charm that lasts through the years! We are looking forward to our next trip!",

          "I've been to Disneyland multiple times and this was the first time I can actually say it was 'low season'. For sure, get the Disneyland App and look and see what wait times are for popular rides because it ebbed and flowed throughout the day. You can also use the app to order",
          "It\u2019s Disney. I won\u2019t ever say anything bad. It\u2019s truly magical. Heads up for rise of the resistance. I got boarding pass 113 at 9:01am. The last boarding call was 115. So if you don\u2019t get the boarding pass in first minute you likely won\u2019t get on the ride. Also once at the",
          "We love Disneyland! We were there for opening weekend of rise of the resistance. It was amazing. I got the max passes which helped with excessive walking but still walked 15 miles in one day!",

          "We were here for five days from morning till night with four kids 4-9 years old. Stayed at courtyard Marriott which was great but if you can stay on site would recommend as kids ( and grandma ) get easily tired. Felt totally safe and food options were great. From junk to",
          "So much fun for the whole family. Had the park hopper pass and 3.5 days to spend between the 2 parks, we loved it but our feet hated us by the end (spent 12 hrs a day there).",
          "we often to to Disney world however this was our first time to Disney Land and we absolutely loved it. There were so many great food options other than the normal fast food you see everywhere. We also loved seeing a part of the original park that Walt built, amazing!",
          "My family and friends had a great time at Disneyland. It was our first time to visit Disneyland, and we spent the entire day exploring the park and riding rides. It was easy to find our way around the park, and the wait time for rides was bad at all. We also really enjoyed",
          "Haven't been to Disneyland in about 20 years. It is still a great adventure and fun for the whole family. All of the classic rides and activities are still there. It was kind of like \"old home\" week. Good to see the old friends.",
          "Disneyland is still great after all these years. A couple of tips to avoid the long lines. First, visit during the non-peak times. Early October to mid November, mid January through mid March, mid April to early May. The fast pass app is overrated and not worth it. The way",
          "I mean what is there is say. I've been to Disney all over the world and this one delivers just as the others do. Main Street is great, the castle is the smaller than the other parks but whatever, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Westernland, New Orleans, Adventureland, all just great",
          "I have never been to Disney, until yesterday! Disneyland is very different to the Adventure Park, this has better eateries (in our opinion) and is more upmarket. It is a little similar to Universal with the design. The shops are all full of merchandise to buy, obvs. A little",
          "Had a great couple of days here. Two days was more than enough to cover both parks. The Max pass app is well worth the money. Even just to take advantage all of the souvenir photos straight to your mobile and being able to book time slots helped with the longer queued rides. You",
          "As a family with teenagers from 18-22 visiting for the first time with our parents, we had the best time. It truly is magical no matter what age you are! We had a 3 day pass and that was sufficient time (although would recommend more time during peak times). There is something",
          "Other than expensive (which is expected) ,the kids and I had a fantastic time. It was definitely worth getting the fastpass max pass. The photo ops were more worth it in California adventure as I felt we seen more characters there than Disney. We got the 3 day hopper passes and",
          "Overall a good day out, but Disneyland felt tired and dated and the food was very dissapointing as were the signs for amenities.",
          "We loved all the details that went into the park and the rides. We went in during non peak season and still waited about 30 mins average for most rides. During peak season and in the heat this would not be fun. There are some lines with lots of entertainment along the wait line.",
          "I love the fact that Disneyland Park is so nostalgic & historical. I\u2019ve also noticed how friendly the cast members are, although it seems like there aren\u2019t as many photographers as WDW has. The next time I go I want to do the \u201cWalk in Walt\u2019s footsteps\u201d tour!",
          "My adult daughter and I had one day to spend at Disneyland Park, neither of us had ever been to Disney and all I can say is it really is the most magical, happiest place on Earth! We thoroughly enjoyed our day there and were as captivated as small children :) We used the Max",
          "We hadn't been to Disneyland in December for many years. You see the commercials and it looks magical. We decided to splurge for an adult only two day trip. We opted for the two day single park pass and did CA Adventure one day and Disneyland the next. It was raining pretty",
          "It got a 2 day pass, that cost approximately $250 USD. It\u2019s best to plan out your activities and if you have a must do ride, I would suggest that is the first thing you head to! I arrived at 8am (finished at 9.30pm), you can take a bag in (food and drink is ok). About 20 mins to",
          "We stayed just off of the grounds at an Airbnb that was a 15 minute walk to the park. Absolutely loved the experience. Some takeaways though: 1) Wifi is terrible. Maxpass is great, but you need data. Very frustrating to rely on the park Wifi. It is about as good as the",
          "We came here on the 24th and 30th of December. We've been here a number of time before and this time the queues were ridiculous. We literally only used the Fastpass mechanism and had very few photos taken to optimise the experience. The new Galaxy's Edge is great BUT you",
          "It's true - Disneyland really is the happiest place on Earth. We spent one day here that was absolutely perfect from start to finish, we loved it so much that we just had to do another (and there's just so much to see). If you're going to go to Disneyland then I'd recommend a",
          "Of course this is the happiest place on earth. A great place to visit. Never to old to go hear. Can be very busy so ensure you grab \u201cfast passes\u201d to skip long queues.

          "So exciting to see the original castle, attractions, etc. where it all started for Walt. My daughter got to visit with Mary Poppins (her favorite) and this totally topped off a wonderful day in the park. Due to its smaller size than Disney World, we were able to enjoy almost",
          "We knew Disneyland would be crazy right after New Years but that is the schedule that we could accommodate with school age grandchildren. Had no idea how tough the experience is, even with Max Pass and using the Disney App. First day we were there Jan 3 at Disneyland park, we",
          "I did have second thoughts about my recent visit to Disney because well it is quite pricy but as soon as you make it through the endless lines and enter the park you seem to forget it more and more. The park is just extraordinary beautiful and filled with beautiful details and",
          "I have been to Disneyland many times over 30 years and always enjoy it. It's clean, friendly and well organized. But wow do they ever pack them in now. Amazing number of electric scooters. when did this become a thing? I felt bad for those in wheelchairs and parents with",

          "We finally had a chance to visit Disneyland at Christmas. We expected the park to be decorated a bit more, so we were a bit disappointed. We are used to Six Flags going all out at Christmas with their park decor and lights. The castle lighting was impressive as well as the",
          "Not what is use to be. Staff members are on phones or talking and it is getting pretty clear it\u2019s all about the $$$ the wait times are pretty ridiculous. Wait in line for 10 hours and have 10 minutes of actual fun.",
          "Disneyland is an American original and as a Disney fan, I needed to go to the place where it all began. The theming, attractions and overall experience are great! We opted for the MaxPass which allows for almost hourly FastPass experiences. We did Disneyland Park and California",

          "I consider myself one of the most devoted Disney followers. So, it takes a lot for me to write anything less than a five star review for this Park. However, I think something needs to be done about the trend of increased cost with no real increase the value. This review is",
          "Was more than I could have expected - definitely want to go again. Have also learnt the lesson of you \u2018think\u2019 you know how expensive everything at Disney is - I was soooo wrong. Take worst case and double it! Get all your Disney gears online and pick up a few special Park",
          "Our Disneyland visit was like a nightmare. It was so crowded and very complicated. My daughter was playing in the parade with her band so that was the highlight of the visit. The parade was beautiful! The rest of visit was horrible. Even though I'd been trained by a Disney pro",
          "Everyone loves Disney and it's easy to see why. The park was busy but fast passes eased the queues and were very effective and worth the extra cost. Avoid weekends to reduce queues! The rides are excellent, the park is super clean and it truly is the happiest place on earth.",
          "Love love love Disneyland. I have just come back from a week at Disneyland over the Christmas holidays, including New Years Eve. And OMG busy is an understatement. I have been to the park in the middle of summer holidays as well as Spring Break and that did nothing to prepare",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed spending Christmas Day 2019 at the park. By a stroke of luck, the crowds weren't insane, so the wait times for rides weren't too bad. Generally though, I highly recommend the Disneyland Park app and the digital fastpass.",

          "Top Tips: 1. Get the Disneyland App and get comfortable using it before you go (you'll need it for your MaxPass if you opt to get one). 2. Park Hopper tickets weren't worth it for us. 3. Max Pass was worth it for scheduling rides. 4. Downtown Disney is fun and admission is",
          "My voice is hoarse from singing on top of my lungs all day into the night at Disneyland. We had a blast at Disneyland for New Year\u2019s Eve. The best party EVER! Disneyland Christmas parade was spectacular as always. Of course, Disneyland fireworks show is the best of them all.",
          "Terrible, prices were crazy and there were gigantic lines. The amount of money spent was a fortune and way over budget. My kids who are 6 and 8 could not stand the lines and a few times we had to get out of them and loose our spots because of the scorching sun.",
          "We took a family vacation to Disneyland in the week between Christmas and New Years. We knew that this would be a very busy time, but it was the only time everyone could go so we decided to go ahead and give it a try. Another layer of challenge was that my youngest granddaughter",

          "We are DVC members and typically know to steer clear of DL during high peak seasons. However we made a special trip this year at Christmas. The 23rd-25th at DL were not to bad for crowds, busy but not intolerable. However that changed dramatically after Christmas! On the 27th by",

          "I've always wanted to go to Disneyland at Christmas. It lived up to my expectations and more. Everything was decorated so Christmas-y from the huge Christmas tree on Main Street to the Christmas parade. I'll remember it for a long time. Such a good experience.",
          "This was our first time to go to Disneyland, we have been to Disney world several times, and we\u2019re very pleased. They definitely embrace Christmas much more at Disneyland, we\u2019ve been to both now for Christmas. Many of the same or very similar rides in both parks, While",
          "A must do attraction, but losing appeal due to overcrowding which makes most rides not accessible after about 10 am. Wait times quickly soar to 60 minutes or more. Take food and drink\u2014Park prices are extortionate. Not much for small kids and what there is overrun by big kids.",
          "Understanding that people will still go I would temper expectations. We arrived at 945 AM then spent 2 hours in line to get in, then another 30 minutes to get tix. Then they closed Disneyland b/c it was at capacity!! So we spent 5 hours in another park we never wanted to see",

          "Disney theme parks in general , are what they are, and either you long forthem or absolutely hate them, but the Star Wars land that was created is an absolute must see. The entire area recreated truly looks,feels, and sounds like a different planet,with amazing attention to",
          "A great place to visit. Be prepared to line up for quite a while to get on the rides unless you use fast pass or go on the single rider sections. A must place to visit if you\u2019re in California.",
          "There is a line for security, there is a line to get in, there is a line for the rides, lines to eat food, airlines to take pictures a famous areas and characters, there are lines to get into lines, and massive crowds to see the parade. The only thing that does not have a line",
          "Expected more from Disneyland, was very disappointed with the we the maxpass works because it doesn't work there are areas in the park where you have no cell phone signal there are issues if you buy it later than 10 in the morning and overall just a waste of money",
          "Great place with great service. Staff go above and beyond to make people comfortable and happy. Best experience for the entire family.",
          "It had been 9 years since our last visit, but our first time when it was decorated for Christmas. We were here for two days, which was close to enough time as Disneyland is nowhere near the size of Disney World. The decorations were amazing. There was a pretty good crowd there",

          "Tuesday 15th October. What a joke! ONE tram working. 20 minute ride plus 13 minutes to load/unload. At least 4 staff members working the ride and simply hanging about plus driver. Not contributing to a successful day. Is this the standard DLP has fallen to?",
          "I've been to Disney World in Orlando and loved it so much, that I couldn't imagine loving it even more. The park is so beautiful, the attractions are great, the Toon Town area is lovely... There are so many great things to point out! The quick service food is amazing and the",

          "Not the Disney of yesteryear. Employees are not trained properly and it shows. With large crowds regardless of the day, employees are short tempered and rude. Walt would not approve. For the $$$$ the young people they hire cannot handle the pressure of their job. We spend 7",

          "Traveled to SoCal with my small group of teenage Girl Scouts. Concierge was over-the-top helpful, as always, presenting 2 of my Girls with graduation plus another special badge to commemorate their last year as Girl Scouts. We opened and closed the park, having a great time.",
          "Disneyland is Disneyland! What can be said, but it is so much fun and wonderful. Lots of people, but the lines were not horrendous. We ate several meals there and several snacks. The Dole Whip was out of this world. The French Market had stew and corn chowder in bread bowls,",
          "Yes, it's sometimes crowded and the tickets are expensive, but there's no other place in the world like Disneyland. We last visited in September 2019 after most kids were back in school and on weekdays, so the crowds were not a problem. Our longest wait in line was 30 minutes",

          "I saved up for a year to take my kids and granddaughters to Disneyland. The day finally got here and I was so disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the smell of Main St. It didn\u2019t have the sweet smell of candy or baked goods. I didn\u2019t hear the fun music that plays while",

          "What more can you say about Disneyland? Even adults can smile all day. We had a two day tickets and still didn't manage to visit every section. We were fortunate enough to visit when there was no holiday and in the middle of the week so the lines where tolerable. If you di visit",
          "We were skeptical. I haven\u2019t been to Disney in over 30 years and wanted to take my kids (9 and 6 years old) so they have the memories. We figure this would be our first and last time going. Are there lines? Yes. Weren\u2019t as bad as we thought. The Indiana Jones ride at night had",
          "I always wanted to see Disneyland, the original! Being from Florida I wanted to see if it was better or different. It is both! The biggest difference I noticed was the small Cinderella's Castle being much smaller than Disney World. Well done and I can check off my bucket list.",
          "Fun to revisit old favourites, but best of all was Galaxy\u2019s Edge. I keep reading about the lack of crowds. It felt pretty much hopping to me. The attention to detail was great. 40 minute wait for the Smugglers Run was fine. A great 2 days.",
          "We enjoyed our 3 days at Disneyland. It was 10 years since we had last visited and was great to see it was still the magical place we fondly remembered. The food and drinks are expensive but it\u2019s all part of the experience. We had a very enjoyable 3 days at both parks and",

          "You need to arrive when the gates open as you will be there until closing if you have kids. We went on some rides more than once. The Star Wars theme area was awesome and if you are a fan this is a must. We highly recommend paying the extra $15 per person for the 'Max pass'.",

          "We had an amazing 3 days here. My son loved it. We were lucky because it wasn't too busy. We had so much fun. Everything was great. Very expensive but worth it to see it through my sons eyes.",
          "I always enjoy Disney. I would suggest getting there as early as possible and get your FastPass to the ride you really want to get on. The price to get in is absolutely crazy but if you want to go allow yourself the time. Also, if you want to eat inside the park check into",

          "I was disappointed this time at Disneyland. We went off season on a Monday and Tuesday and it was so crowded we missed the electric light parade and the other shows. We used the fast pass which the app was very hard to understand at first. The rides weren\u2019t too bad typically",
          "I absolutely LOVE Disneyland park! This is the third or fourth time I have visited and I will be back again. I love the way it is totally immersive and you feel like you\u2019re in another world. It is the happiest place I know of! The attractions are wonderful and never seem to get",

          "We purchased 3 day park hopper tickets with MaxPass. This included Fast Pass by mobile phone, and the ability to download the Disney Photos. Because the park was fairly busy, this saved us some time in that we didn't have to go to attractions to pick up Fast Passes in person.",
          "Compared to Disneyworld, we loved the size of this park. The park hopper pass we actually used without being exhausted by the time you made it to the second park. The Magic Hours were not very beneficial as they had magic hours for ALL resorts not just the ones on property.",
          "What has happened to Disneyland? There are many things to love about Disney parks, but standing in line for 90-minutes for each attraction makes the day painful and unproductive. The new Galaxy\u2019s Edge looks amazing but there is almost nothing to do there. They don\u2019t tell",
          "We were unable to enjoy almost anything at Disney because of the outrageous crowds. Do they ever put a max on the number of people allowed in at any given time? Lines are so long that I oveheard children saying they spent as much as 3 hours waiting for just one popular",
          "Words cannot describe the magic that Disneyland has to offer. It doesn't matter whether you're 8 years old or 88 years old, when you enter Disneyland, you feel like you're a kid. You enter another world that is simply breathtaking and mind blowing. All the rides and the",
          "Where do I begin? Disneyland has changed (for the worse) in just a few years! The magic has been trampled by the stampedes of people, strollers, obesity and scooters. Outrageous and very dangerous. The food is super overpriced. The fastpass should be re-named SLOWpass.",
          "I've been to Disneyland several times in my life but recently went in September. This was by far the best time of year I'd been as the crowds were low, the wait times were reasonable and the weather was pleasant. I'd recommend using the max pass option if you're there during a",

          "We visited Disneyland for 4 days with the park hopper. Everything went smoothly beginning at security bag check. The lines were long to get in but it only took about 5 mins to get through the gate because the system is very efficient. The park was very clean and organized. We",
          "I suggest to purchase a three day dual park ticket to see both parks at liesure. You will need atleast one day for Disney California Adventure and two days for Disneyland Park. In my view, Park Hopping ticket is not necessary.",
          "We can not get enough of this magical place, it is my family's favorite destination to visit. No mater what age you are, the moment you step foot in the park you are engulfed in that feel good energy! The smell, the sounds and all the food and attractions, it is a combination",
          "First, fly into the Burbank Airport, saved us 100 dollars per ticket from Sacramento on Southwest compared to flying into Orange County. If you go to Galaxy's Edge, don't be disappointed, it is still a work in progress, take time to admire the intricate artwork and craftsmanship",

          "Wow, soo crowded even on a Monday. The fast pass is a rip off - you have to wait a long time until you can use it again. The rides we did were fun but the crowds were overwhelming. The kids enjoyed it but up to a point. Why any adults would go (unless with kids) is beyond me.",
          "We just visited Disneyland with 2 families and had such a horrible weekend. It is sooooo busy, you even have to wait half an hour to get a coffee. One hour to 2 hour queues for attractions. No place to sit and relax. It\u2019s just too crowded! Our kids were very disappointed because",

          "Just about everything has already been said about Disneyland, but my impression is that it is as magical a place as could be created outside of the larger World in Florida. We visited in early August on a Wednesday and Thursday. We got MaxPasses and that made all the difference.",

          "Very expensive but still a decent day out. The one thing that this park does better than Magic Kingdom is that Fast Passes come out that day in the morning and not 3 months earlier. We have been to Florida and not been able to get a Fast Pass for rides such as Flight of Passage",

          "We visited disneyland with 2 grown-up kids. We stayed there from rope drop until the final parade and the fireworks. It has been an amazing experience. I do think, however, that the prices are extremely expensive. I don't see how an average family can afford it. Nevertheless I",
          "It was a respite from extreme rides but magical and story-filled. The teens enjoyed themselves but longed for more extreme rides. I actually enjoyed the trip more than when I was a teen. It's all about characters and stories is what have come to realize. It's a really nice park",
          "Disney's best park! Having been to Orlando, Hong Kong, and Paris, I was very surprised at the level of attractions and fun in the original place - here in Los Angeles California. By far the most enjoyable park. We've been here for a whole day, it's pretty exhausting, but the",
          "Disneyland is expensive, we paid $142 and we are not kids, yes we went to star wars, whilst the ride is useless the experience outside is magical with characters everywhere, and displays. And even if that not enough the fireworks are alone possibly the best ever. If you can",

          "We loved Disneyland, the atmosphere, staff, characters, rides, and shows. The fast pass was excellent, just with there were a few more rides added. We found ourselves being sucked into the pin trading world, lots of fun. Of course things \u2026",
          "You have to get past the crowds, because it can really weigh on your experience. So with that said, Disney really knows how to show you a great time. The park is absolutely immaculate and the employees are focused on making your experience \u2026",
          "We did the one day park hopper pass with fastpass during peak season.  Came to $1000.  Worth every penny. Our kids had a blast and the new Star Wars exhibit is amazing.\n\nOne tip - don't run to the ride at the beginning of the day, go instead towards mid to end of day when the lines are much shorter.",
          "The happiest place on earth they say. Well, it was a pretty awesome experience to visit this park. It was my first time here and loved it. A 3 day or a 4 day pass would be wonderful to ride all the rides you want and attractions or shows to see.",
          "As the saying goes \"The happiest place on earth\" it definitely is.  We just took our daughters back after 5 years. They were so excited, counting down the days and minutes. They were not dissatisfied. Disneyland delivered at \ud83d\udcaf. The only \u2026",
          "Of course Disneyland is great for all the reasons we visit the park. The rides are in good operation, the nostalgia is great. There is a fair amount of seating except in areas where one might be waiting in line. Because the lines are so \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth! Heavy crowds usually, especially on weekends and school holidays. \nLines for characters are usually shortest right away in the morning or in the afternoon. \nIf you want a good seat for the parades, have someone get a spot an hour in advance and lay down a sheet/blanket to establish your spot.",
          "I love Disneyland because there is something interesting and fun for everyone. You can buy a park hopper pass and easily go back and forth navigating between two different parks; the original Disneyland which includes areas such as these, \u2026",
          "I go to Disneyland at least 2-3 times a year and I ALWAYS love it! Always have a good time there whether with family or friends. I have lots of favorite food places, I always get a new Mickey ears hat of sorts there every visit as well as \u2026",
          "Happy please on earth Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under \u2026",
          "Props to their decorating team; every little bit was decked out for the holidays. Even the rides were changed to reflect the season! Galaxy's Edge was incredible, but I wish they had opened the new attraction. But overall excellent and highly recommend!",
          "As always the place was completely full. But we are used to this so we had good comfy shoes and ran all over. I was with my husband, sister and brother in law and our 4 almost 5 year old niece and she was just able ride pretty much every \u2026",
          "What can really be said about Disneyland that you don't already know? It is amazing. From when I was a kid I used to love going to Disney and I'll be honest it hasn't deteriorated any as an adult. If I have friends in town I will go to the \u2026",
          "It's Disneyland. What's not to love? The atmosphere and attention to detail is just the best. While I'm not a huge Star Wars fan I can appreciate the immersive integrity of the addition.  The sounds and smells and characters is pretty cool. \u2026",
          "The park is always cared for impeccably. All rides maintained well. Staff always friendly. However, my feet kill me everyday after the 1st 2 hours!!!!!! Can't they put benches in the lines!! I'm sure they have thought about this but I am taking double doses of ibuprofen and still can't keep the pain down.",
          "Best Disneyland I have ever been to. Super friendly. Hotel room is nice and clean. Workers always enthusiastic and in a great mood , very contagious! amazing.",
          "First trip in a long time, took the family for a trip and it was wonderful, lines should always be expected, some rides more than others. My suggestion is making sure that kids traveling with you are 42\" as they can go on all but 1 ride if \u2026",
          "Disneyland what can I say?  It\u2019s quite simple. This is one of the cleanest theme parks I\u2019ve ever been to.  Job well done on maintenance and keeping this theme park in tip top shape.  The food is delicious, service is impeccable, clearly a \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth! Rise of the Resistance was spectacular. I have never been on a more immersive and fun ride! Thank you for the delicious meatless breakfast wrap at Galaxy's Edge! Keep us the great work Disney!",
          "Absolutely love this place! My wife, family and I are on our second trip as a family. My kids have been looking forward to this since our last trip five years ago. These guys run quite a production and everything seems like much thought and \u2026",
          "I've been here during extremely crowded times and not so crowded times. When it is too crowded, it is hard to enjoy everything. The lines are outrageous (even with fast pass), lines for the bathrooms, can't walk at a normal pace, you have \u2026",
          "This goes without saying, but go prepared to be a child for the day and it will be a purely unforgettable experience. I went for Galaxy\u2019s Edge, and I felt completely immersed in a different world. Even the trash cans and credit card readers \u2026",
          "Such a great trip. We are big Disney Parks fans, and being from the East coast, getting to the original park is quite a trip for us. It was everything we were expecting and MUCH more. The cast members are great, parks are always clean, and all the attractions are fun. We love going to the parks to feel like kids again.",
          "Great except the boarding pass needed for the Rise of the Resistance ride is completely unfair. Especially because of the first come first serve basis of the passes, people who can't come early suffer consequences. Its completely unfair for \u2026",
          "Nobody beats this place!  It is crazy expensive but worth almost every penny. They do it right, and the kids have a blast!  Use the fast pass on the mobile app and try the single rider lane. You will thank me later.",
          "Bring some shoes good for long distance walking and expect to be in thick crouds of people. The experience is expensive but nobody does it like Disney. The park is very well run and maintained. The lines move quickly on most rides. Oh, get the app, it's very helpful.",
          "Still magical after all these years. We planned our visit at the least crowded time of year, and I wouldn't do it any other way. We didn't wait more than 20 minutes for anything. Make sure you get the app and max out your fast passes. The \u2026",
          "We love all things Disney. This was our first trip to the Land. If you\u2019ve ever been to the World, it\u2019s quite a bit different. California Adventure was fun. Our favorite was the Cars Land. We were disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to get a \u2026",
          "Love this place! I know it's a bit expensive but it never gets old to me! They still have great classic rides and feels like they is always something new... The new Star Wars Rise of the Resistance is the best! Whole new experience it's great \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Magical. A long history of memories, love and family that cannot be duplicated. Any other park is simply artificial. This trip we ate at the Blue Bayou and hung out at Downtown Disney. So much to offer. Best of times!!",
          "It's Disneyland!!! \"Greatest place on earth\" right??? It was a wonderful trip. We were there over Christmas (including Christmas Eve/Day) It was crazy busy! Honesty, if I was pushing stroller I may have thought differently about this trip. \u2026",
          "Disneyland is amazing! Great atmosphere and fun for all ages. I'm an out of town visitor and came with my husband, 3yr old, and 6month old. \n\nThere's lots of waiting in lines, as you'd expect. But it's a safe, clean, engaging place that has \u2026",
          "Big shout out to Andy who works the Toy story mania ride. My daughter left her light sabre on the ride and he had the team search all the carts for it. We got it back :) \n\nWe found all the staff incredibly friendly. The grounds are \u2026",
          "I proposed to my fiance here tonight!\n\nEverything was awesome all day.\nThey cancelled the fireworks due to weather, and I was going to propose during the fireworks at the end of the night. But I had a plan B, so it all worked out.\n\nThe Happiest Place On Earth just got better!",
          "Hi Uncle Walt.  Thank you.  Your dream is beautiful.   You cast members are excellent.  This place does classic  rides best.  Food is better here than on the east coast.",
          "I have avoided going for 20 years because of my anxiety around the lineups and crowds.  I have to say I wish I had gone earlier, the crowds were not bad and the lineups for the rides moved quickly.  The operators do a fantastic job getting \u2026",
          "The most fun I\u2019ve had in decades. The Disney brand takes it to the next level. Having Fast Pass makes lines so much more manageable. But even in line it\u2019s visually interesting enough that time passes quickly. I don\u2019t know what else to say. \u2026",
          "Amazing!! One of the greatest experiences I have ever experienced!! However I highly recommend Disney Orlando Florida... but still.  Definitely worth a trip with You, Family, Friends, etc.",
          "The Disney Land had sufficient rides for children over 36\".  The Fast Pass came in handy, but cannot be used until on the property.  Had the photo pass as it was hooked to the fast pass, so got a number of photos and the ones from the rides \u2026",
          "Absolutely one of my happy places full of fun and laughter a place you can forget about any worried and just enjoy the moment your in with the people you love and sharing the experience with. As the original Disney park I love the nostalgic feel and the way the Pak has different rides to Florida.",
          "Welcome to Disneylines! Yes, you will have to wait in lines but as long as you are prepared and plan your day well it goes by quick! I love Disneyland and always have an amazing time. It is pricey but it is so worth it!",
          "You've been warned..trying to get on Rise of The Resistance requires a huge amount of effort at this point, and took us 2 days to actually get on. Too much detail to put here, but, be sure to read up on all of the steps required to try & \u2026",
          "Yes, it's pricey...but it's about the best experience you can get for a theme park. This one started it all. The app is very handy. The food is tasty...and not as expensive as one might think. The rides are iconic. The park is always clean \u2026",
          "Little has changed in 20 years and price has tripled. The new start wars area is why I went and was great, small but great fun. Only one ride was available the other was booked out, so ensure you advance book tickets ... bit outrageous since you pay $149 just to get in.",
          "3 day pass is the best deal-don't recommend an annual pass unless you are thinking about going once a month at a minimum. - I have a Delux Pass. Best to bring your own food and snacks unless you are going for the food experience that particular day. Enjoy!!!",
          "Being a pass holder for five years now has been wonderful. Living close to Disneyland is a true joy and something I wanted to take full advantage of. Thankfully, now that I\u2019m here one to two times a week, I really feel like I\u2019m getting my \u2026",
          "The best place in the world! We did Ca. Adventure yesterday... fun... but it's not Disneyland!   Disneyland today and it was as amazing and magical as always!  Plus enjoyed the new Star Wars exhibit!  What an awesome and incredible day!",
          "Magic happen here, charming and fun days or night. Lines can be long on holidays and weekends but it worth it for the happiest place on earth. It can be expensive when you have a big family, so be ready to pay hundreds of dollars so budget \u2026",
          "This was the best trip yet to the park!  It is still pricey, any way you try it, the cost adds up extremely quickly. I would recommend using the parking structures vs. the lots. That way you should have to walk as far to get back to your \u2026",
          "This was my first visit to Disneyland Park and it was awesome!! Indiana Jones, Star-Wars, and so much more. The Disneyland Park is built around a very imersive experience. Each area really feels authentic and the rides are pretty \u2026",
          "The care to detail and customer service at the Disney Resorts are second to none. Not sure what else I can say. Just an amazing experience all around. My only complaint was the lack of gluten free options at quick service windows. That is too be expected everywhere but I was hoping Disney might be better with their options.",
          "We went for a day and was so worth it. We were able to get on rise of the resistance and boy was it amazing! My son had so much fun with the cast at galaxy edge. They made it so memorable for our son. Especially the imperial first officer. \u2026",
          "Star Wars -Rise Of The Resistance. We are in line to ride. Ride breaks. It\u2019s been an hour 15 minutes. No word. No communication. Disney staff says that if we leave we can\u2019t come back later today. No reschedule. No fast pass. You forfeit \u2026",
          "The happiest place on Earth! I went to Disneyland for the first time ever (I'm 26) in September of 2019 and it was the most magical and amazing experience ever! I rode Indiana Jones 6+ times. Galaxy's Edge is an absolute dream! Building a \u2026",
          "A nice day out with my family. We managed to do most of what we wanted (although we didn't win the 'Rise of the Resistance' lottery which was frustrating with only a one day visit available to us.\nWe bought a photo pass which ended up being \u2026",
          "I feel the staff here are very professional and good at what they do. They did everything to make the experience ever so much more special with one of my daughters being a special needs kids. Thank you Disney for a great experience for both my daughter and I.",
          "Nostalgic and ground breaking. Always moving forward but remembering and honoring the past. It's the most magical place on \ud83c\udf0e. Where science, fantasy, and magic live happily together.",
          "Still an excellent vacation destination! There are too many little rascal assistance vehicles in the park tho. It appears there are too many lazy people claiming they are handicapped so they can avoid walking and get on rides quicker. However Disneyland actually calls them \"convenience vehicles\", so there you go.",
          "Its Disneyland! The original. Always do we enjoy visiting the land of Mouse. I've been coming here a number of decades. Excellent customer service. It's a very pricey experience, but there are far more pricey experiences out there. The \u2026",
          "Clearly a winner of a park! Incredible rides, so much effort put into proper management, visual appeal of the park and rides. However wait times can be super long. Make sure to collect fast distribution (free) for 2-3 rides. This will cause \u2026",
          "Basically this is the happiest place on Earth where your inner child gets to shine.\n\nGoing during Halloween was the best experience ever. Crowds were light and the weather was good.\n\nI highly recommend the Max Pass. It's so worth the money \u2026",
          "Being a frequent visitor to Disney World, it\u2019s been on our bucket list to check out Disney Land. There were several experiences that were different and we took full advantage. We had an amazing time, especially since the lines were no where near as long as we are used to. The Matterhorn ride was so much fun, we rode it a few times.",
          "Continues to be an outstanding vacation destination for all ages. They keep the park clean at all times and given how many visitors walk through the gates daily, this must be an enormous responsibility. All the cast members are friendly and \u2026",
          "Love love love Disneyland. It's always clean and tidy. Cast members are very friendly and polite. Definitely recommend getting an annual pass if you will visit more than once a year.",
          "Wonderfully fun rides and attractions with a friendly helpful cast of personnel manning the park. Rise of the Resistance is an incredible addition to the park. The major downsides are the prices are incredibly marked up on everything and the sheer mass of people that cause massive wait times, even with fast passes waits can be long",
          "Both my wife and I are annual pass holders. This is our second year and let me tell you after having it once and going a few months without Disney pass we missed it so much. Great place for the family and your others you bring. Great food, games and roller coasters. Its Disney, how could you not love it!",
          "Thanks to a special friend we were invited to spend the day with a Park Hopper Pass. But most importantly a dinner this evening at Club 33. Having been there before this is extraordinary. I am really looking forward to this occasion. The \u2026",
          "I had the best time with my fiancee here as my first time here. The park was clean and the employees are awesome. I find it pretty cool that everyone stays professional and delivers a great experience for the guests. Thats what a magical experience is all about.",
          "We're so grateful to one of their staff for giving us good service while my friends and I were drinking at the Lobby Lounge. He was pleasant and kind. He also made sure our drinks we're delectable. And assisted us in requesting songs with the band. Thank you so much!",
          "The greatest! Enjoy all the iconic and fun things here! Make sure to read up on how to use your max passes and different apps such as touring plans and your trip should be successful and so fun!!",
          "Always a pleasure.  Sure it's crowded but it delivers on all promises.  It's clean and safe and fun and they have way more benches than in the past and organized stroller parking.",
          "Came back for the first time in a long time to treat my nieces and it's as magical as I remembered from childhood. Highly recommend arriving at the time they open (varies by day) to catch a couple of rides before the crowds get heavier. If \u2026",
          "As packed as it always is Disneyland is still a fun place to visit. If you're a thrill seeker it isn't the park for you, but if you want to feel immersed in the experience this is the place to do it. From the minute you step inside you feel \u2026",
          "The happiest place on earth! Visited during the holiday season, but have been during off season as well, would recommend either. Really want to point out that Disneyland is very doable alone as well. Through their app you can easily upload \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing. Such a privilege to grow up in socal and getting to enjoy Disneyland as much as I possibly can. The kids always have such an amazing time. And for some odd reason the day I came all of the lines were under 30 minutes up until 3pm that day. Who would have thought.",
          "Who is honestly looking at Google reviews of Disneyland, I mean come on! You know exactally what you're getting yourself into and it's going to be magical. It's just incredible. Every part of everything, from the food, to the cast members, to the attractions. I think about my trip all the time, I wish I could go back all the time.",
          "Very clean. Food is great. My pass expired and I\u2019m sad I can\u2019t go any more.",
          "Dreams came through, there are water fountain everywhere so don't need to buy any drinks, the food is not too expensive too, recommended to get a fast pass to avoid the queues and to download the Disney app to use as you can book your fast \u2026",
          "It was so amazing I would totally recommend it to anyone. Just get a Fast Pass or a Max Pass to go on rides a lot quicker. The star wars was absolutely incredible I really don't have to words to describe it. Hope you all go.",
          "HEY, ITS DISNEY! Overpriced fun for everyone. That should be their motto, best days of my life take place at Disney",
          "I had to wait 27 years before I was finally able to go...and it was worth every penny I spent to go! The rides, the staff, the food, the magical moment when the reality of the real world fades into the background and you feel yourself being \u2026",
          "I love this place but get sad knowing that the price only allows privileged kids to see it.  It is awesome!  156$ a ticket plus 25$ to park adds up to a couple thousand fast with family.",
          "Easy parking and shuttle service. Organized parking lots and shuttle routes made to and from the park very smooth. Beautiful Holiday decorations, Friendly staff, rides worked perfect, lots of restrooms available, many food options. I was \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth? Maybe. This definitely points to the fact that there must be happier places elsewhere in the universe...just haven't found them yet. A \"must go\" for everyone. You're never too old!",
          "The way the they handle a guest with  disability is atrocious. For some reason they will deny you a return time pass at California adventure, like they are made out of gold, keep pushing for me to buy the max pass, if I was to buy the max \u2026",
          "Disneyland is a fantastic fun park. I went here with my friends  and i had enjoyed  a lot and can never forget that.",
          "I love the rides and the picture perfect park. The crowds are not my favorite thing, but today I came to ride the Rise of the Resistance. It was not just a ride, but an experience. I highly recommend it!",
          "Things have changed since I last went about 5 yrs ago. So I got the value price on a weekday. Their lowest price. I wanted to take my kids to meet characters, see the parade and fireworks like how I saw when I went all those other times. \u2026",
          "Went to the happiest (and most expensive) place on earth! Had a fun time, busy but not crazy. Surprisingly the food was good. Had a salad at the holiday cafe and the Waldorf salad. Both were good. Even the coffee was good. Stayed for the \u2026",
          "So excited that I had a chance to experience Club 33. So beautiful and food was absolutely delicious. Service was excellent...what one would expect from Disney.",
          "The park was very crowded. Unfortunately we couldn't ride the newest attraction at Galaxys edge even though we arrived at 8:20am at the park. The rides and shows were very good as usual but I'd recommend to do a different type of boarding \u2026",
          "Definitely worth it to go during the holidays the place is decked out in Christmas lights. I went on the weekend before Christmas (Dec 22) and there was an amazing parade, and since the sun sets pretty early the lights are perfect to enjoy \u2026",
          "First, the new Star Wars ride is amazing. Very immersive and interactive experience. Disneyland is magical still. The cast members are helpful and understanding, the park is perpetually clean, and the detail is astounding. Be prepared to pay through the nose for all their tasty snacks and drinks, but it's Disneyland. Go for it!",
          "My partner and I love this Disney Park and we went for our anniversary! I feel like I could spend days and days going on their rides multiple times and I wouldn\u2019t get tired. We went a week before Halloween, and they set up stations where \u2026",
          "Always such wonderful days of adventure. The cast members are always going above and beyond to make everyday magical. From the moment you walk through security until you say your final goodbye of the day. The app is great to see which ride \u2026",
          "Having fun with my wife and Veronica and Savannah. I had just over an hour sleep the day before and drove 6 hours to our Hotel then had breakfast then off to the park. Now is almost 11pm and I know my family will stay to 1am til closing. O \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth. Seriously it\u2019s such a magical place, I visited it on nov and it was Christmas themed, it was amazing! I recommend to purchase the max pass is totally worth it. I went 2 days 1 Park p/day I recommend to spend 2 days at Disneyland (I didn\u2019t get to see all the park in 1 day).",
          "The park is always clean, music playing...you are transported to a happy place. It is pricey but the food is well prepared. The new star wars experience did not disappoint. I'm already looking forward to next visit.",
          "I'm from So Cal but live overseas now and it feels like the park is losing some of its sheen. We visited on an off-peak day and felt really underwhelmed. The new Star Wars ride was booked out (even though we arrived at park opening), there \u2026",
          "My favourite Disney park in the world. The first time I came here was in 2002 (I\u2019m from Australia) and I\u2019ve been back nearly every year since. The staff are friendly, love going on the amazing rides and seeing the shows/parades. I will never get sick of visiting Disneyland.",
          "I loved that my grandchildren were able to see all of the characters.  I also loved how the characters were with my service dog. They went out of their way to make sure that we were all so very comfortable.",
          "Good amusement, amazing rides, clean place kids enjoy till the last moment, great fireworks. To sum up a happy place. But food is too pricey.",
          "GET THE APP!!!\nIt's the happiest place on earth, but the app helps so much with lines and notifications, parades, and shows.  And understand what qualifies as a discount, it's tough learning on the final day that your chase debit card would fetch 10% off.",
          "Props to their decorating team; every little bit was decked out for the holidays. Even the rides were changed to reflect the season! Galaxy's Edge was incredible, but I wish they had opened the new attraction. But overall excellent and highly recommend!",
          "The staff was very friendly and courteous. The rooms are fantastic. We have traveled all over the world and now this is the nicest hotel on our trip so far. I give a huge recommendation to anyone looking or a nice place to stay in a good part of town.",
          "A magical experience for all ages. We spent two days in each park and that seemed like a perfect amount for our family. It's worth doing research on how to maximize your time and money.",
          "Great fun as always for the park. Even during the busiest time of the year we managed to get in over 13 rides a day. The food is always spectacular (especially in Galaxy's Edge). Disneyland is a great time for kids and those who are kids at \u2026",
          "Fantastic amusement park! Very clean and well kept with friendly and helpful staff.  The food is the only drawback: overpriced and underwhelming.  Star Wars: Galaxies Edge on the other hand is truly amazing.  You really feel that you have \u2026",
          "It was my dream Land \ud83d\ude2d. I can't believe even as an adult now I was more excited there than my kids\ud83e\udd7a. Everything was worth every dollar only regret was that it's too big to visit in one day. Couldn't finish everything and had to skip lot of stuff. Might visit again after few years to see and compare changes.",
          "Um yeah...what does one say about the world famous Disneyland? Our family loves it. All ages. The theming, cleanliness, engineering, world class guest services, the list just goes on and on. \nBiggest key to happiness here is learning line management. Phone apps are extremely helpful.",
          "One too many people for the happiest place on earth. So much to explore for sure. If you have kids or love Disney characters in general, there\u2019s no reason not to like about this place. Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge was really impressive, but most of them were either stores selling a ton of merchandise or restaurants.",
          "Love it! Bought an annual pass so I can come back as often as I can. Celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary with no kids at Disneyland! Galaxy's Edge was so exciting had a blast on Smugglers Run in the Millennium Falcon. Can't wait to come back to see Rise of the Resistance.",
          "We LOVED IT!!! We came Nov 21, 2019 with our 3 kids, 5, 7 and 10 months and it was beautiful! So much to do our first visit and we enjoyed 12 attractions and feel that was enough with 3 kids our first time. We will be back again and look \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth, really enjoyed it I\u2019ve been wanting to go to this place when I was a kid and my dream finally came true, the rides were amazing and were really nice. Me and my family were really happy and we will go there one day \u2026",
          "The happiest place on Earth, loved every second being there. The rides are so much fun and the atmosphere makes you feel so happy. Such a fun place for any Disney fan",
          "We went on a Wednesday in early March! It was great! The park was not crowded; even the newest star wars attraction only had 25 minutes wait. Most other rides only had 10-20 minutes wait. We went on at least 10 rides - then I lost count. \u2026",
          "Magical any time of the year. It\u2019s a place that seems to take all your worry and stress away while your there and you just focus on having fun. It\u2019s simply like no other place in the world. I highly recommended it to anyone. Disneyland a must see on your lifetime.",
          "It's truly the happiest place on earth! I recommend using the park app to check wait times and order food. It also will show you which rides are safe for expectant mothers, where you can relieve a service dog, where baby changing centers are, etc. My favorite park experiences are afternoon tea and dinner at Blue Bayou.",
          "While I'm not necessarily a Disney fanatic... Or a huge Disney fan in general I do enjoy most of their movies and always loved Star Wars even if I don't agree with how Disney treats them in movies... I am amazed at how they represent star wars at Galaxy's edge! Pretty mind blowing...",
          "This really is one of the happiest places on Earth. Absolutely love visiting here. They treat a single guest so nicely and really try to make my visit a bit more \"special\" when there are thousands of people who have families or friends with them.",
          "Good place for kids. Parents will have fun if you see your kids happy. However, try to go on days that kids are in school because lines for rides are to a minimum. Prices are getting more and more pricey so a family of 4 will at least need \u2026",
          "Just finished our 3 day trip with my family. 3 kids - 3,4,&5 year old. We got the max pass on our phones and it was well worth it! Especially how they include the photo pass. Every worker had good attitudes, happy and pleasant",
          "Great experience and completely worth the visit. Make sure you get here before the park opens to get the full experience! You have to get the fast pass to make full use of the park. It\u2019s very much worth the money because you will get to \u2026",
          "Smaller than florida but its still very good in fact its better because its not that humid",
          "So much fun for adults and children alike. They really go above and beyond to make it a magical place!",
          "Even during the crowded holiday the time spent created a lifetime of wonderful memories.  Worth every moment standing inline.",
          "First time taking my children here and we had a blast!  The rides are fun, the ambiance is amazing and the cast members are incredible.  We went on a off day, which was the best - lines were small, a lot less crowded.  My favorite ride has \u2026",
          "I'm from the east coast and my first time visiting was 1/16/20 and I had such a magical time! This was only a day trip, so next time I hope I can go multiple days in a row to get on all the rides and explore the park more. Our day was \u2026",
          "Got the max pass this last time and it was a lot better experience. If it is your first time i highly recommend getting the disneyland app on your phone it gives you a map and you can buy tickets food and download your pictures as well as \u2026",
          "This really is the \"happiest place on Earth\"! Disneyland has an abundance of classic rides perfect for all ages. But be sure to get fast passes or you might be stuck in line for the better part of 2 hours.",
          "Disney is the best theme park. It's clean and of you know the system, you can ride so much. We did the rise of the resistance ride. It was AMAZING!",
          "Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision \u2026",
          "Great place. Gets full and they temporarily stop letting people in. It does get crowded, so you'll have to be squeezing through lots of people. The rides are very fun. Worth getting fast passes",
          "There is a very decent promo right now (Jan - May 2020)  for South CA resident for a 3 day pass. W/CA adventure. Fast pass is a must. Arrive at park open to have a shot as Smugglers Run as reservations fill in first 3 minutes.",
          "A magical experience for all ages. We spent two days in each park and that seemed like a perfect amount for our family. It's worth doing research on how to maximize your time and money.",
          "It was a wonderful experience however some of the attractions close off @ 8pm when I got to a few of them 7.30- 8.45pm they were already closed off and denied customers entry. That was the only downside. Otherwise it's a great place for kids and kids @ heart.",
          "Phenomenal experience. Incredible. A privilege. Well kept. Well cared for. Expensive, but worth it to have such an experience. The rides are incredible, having California Adventure immediately across is perfect. The strollers need the tops \u2026",
          "Who doesn't love Disneyland? All that said, we went on one of the busiest days of the year. I recommend waiting for a less crowded time to go. If you can't, be very smart about how you plan your fast passes (if you can, totally go the Max Pass route...you won't regret it).",
          "It was amazing, if you like fast rides I would recommend space mountain and thunder mountain. If you like scenery rides I would recommend Alice in Wonderland. This review was done by my 9 year old son.",
          "Its Disney!! Went for Disney after dark sweetheart night, it was awesome. Crowds were manageable, wonderful photo ops which were all free with event ticket! Good food deals during event as well.",
          "You can't not have a good ol' time at Disneyland. There is so much to do there now! And with all the wait times posted, you can plan out your day via the Disneyland park app! \nTHE BIGGEST TIP I HAVE FOR YOU: Get there at opening time and \u2026",
          "To tell you the truth I have never been there but, I imagine it must be a fun and amazing place to go. My kids got the opportunity to go and I thank God for giving them that especial moment of their lives a great experience for them.\u2764",
          "Star Wars is by far the best aspect of this park. Be prepared to book a boarding group in the Disneyland app as soon as the park opens. They fill up within 2-3 minutes of opening. \nVery few characters were around which was disappointing \u2026",
          "Never have I had a bad experience here. I've been four times and each time has gotten more magical with Disney's amazing attention to detail and customer satisfaction. I love life when I am here.",
          "This is my favorite place in the whole world. I have been an annual pass holder since I was a kid and I love that now that I have my own kids they get to experience the same Disney magic that I did. It really is the Happiest Place on Earth!!!!",
          "One of my happy places on earth! Paying for the MaxPass made our trip easier; we were able to get on most of the rides we wanted. Knowing how long the wait times are for each ride also helped plan our day better. Going back ASAP!",
          "Without question, this is the King of all Disney properties.  Always reinventing itself to make each visit both nostalgic and fresh at the same time.  No theme park gives you the emotional connection and allows you to release your inner kid better.\n\nDisneyland for life!!",
          "I can't say anything bad about Disneyland. It's SO magical, SO amazing. We went during low crowds and rode over a dozen rides in a single day, no problems, just pure fun. I absolutely LOVE Disneyland",
          "Download the app. Lots of good helpfulness all around. Fast passes are a must for the family on the move. Clam Chowder in the bread bowl for the win. Pineapple Dole Whip Float always hits the spot. Corn dog truck at the end of Main Street \u2026",
          "Disneyland is magical as always and has a little bit of fun for the whole family. Even as adults we can have fun exploring Batuu in Star Wars: Galaxy's edge. 13 hours was easily reached as we were there on the busiest day of the year, but \u2026",
          "Truly brings happiness and fun for the whole family. Prices are pretty high, as the kids get older would definitely recommend a six flags instead but for their childhood Disneyland is a wonderful place, especially you go at the right time year when the lines aren't that long.",
          "This place is the best! I have been here twice and came home telling stories about it for 6 months!",
          "Please, what's not to love?! The new Star Wars ride is truly a must do. Rise of the Resistance. A nice interactive experience. Different and fun. Think Star Tours in real life.",
          "I love this place so much. The cast members are awesome and the customer service is always over the top! It would be nice if Disney would make admission more affordable though. We also did get stuck on a ride for over an hour but were also \u2026",
          "Disney fans must visit. Great place to get inspired and spark creativities. Got to go on a Disney Cruise, especially Alaska excursions. Bucket list item. Memeroble Experience of life time. Don't forget to do yoga on the deck of the Disney \u2026",
          "I liked it but the only complaint I have is if you want a simple picture in front of the castle you have to make a line just for a professional picture but not only there also  in other popular spots in the end it is and isn't worth your time. Also star wars galaxy's edge is so cool I suggest going there",
          "Need I explain? The devotion that goes into making Disneyland a truly magical place can't be overlooked. Though I wish some of the visiting families would mind their behavior and watch their children better.",
          "Definitely the ace to take your kids. The magic is real! We have been to both Disney world and Disneyland and in our opinion the people at Disneyland were nicer. Everyone got along and there was a friendliness between customers and \u2026",
          "Our family had a blast being able to go to Disneyland the week before Christmas! There was always something to do. The fast pass is definitely worth buying each day as you can be standing in line for one ride, while waiting for your \u2026",
          "My third time here.  Amazing as always.  Got to ride the new rides at Galaxy's Edge, Smuggler's Run and Rise of the Resistance.  Well worth the wait.",
          "It's Disneyland. All good except for the express lanes. Put the gate price up if you like but treat everyone the same. The local geeks have got the star wars area worked out and it's very difficult to get in as a tourist. You have to be \u2026",
          "The lines for some of the rides can get a bit long but literally every staff member was incredibly friendly and nice.  All of the restaurants went above and beyond to accommodate our food allergies.  There's more things tiny humans CAN do than things they can't.",
          "Everything good and more. A tight run ship that rolls with the punches and delivers on the promise of magic and memories. As adults, we loved it and were entertained, and our toddler daughter was enamored with the world of Disney. So magical. Dreams are fulfilled and createdhere.",
          "We went to celebrate my daughter's birthday. She was wearing a birthday shirt and a birthday button. Everyone who saw it wish her a happy birthday. When we went to the Star Wars attraction there was a man playing flute-like instrument. He \u2026",
          "I personally was expecting more to it, always wanted to go as a kid.  Guess I didn\u2019t miss out on much, but my kids loved it.  That\u2019s what it was all about, they enjoyed it, so that makes me happy.",
          "What more is there to say, is Disneyland! Experience at the park is definitely influenced by how busy it is. Highly recommend the Max Pass for photos delivered to your phone and for the fast track onto rides. Mobile ordering food is another perk!",
          "This place is magical.  I went over Christmas and in 63 degree weather they made is Snow on Main street.  Christmas lights and parades and all the attractions dressing up for the event.  Just magical.  Once we figured out fast passes we \u2026",
          "Even though I am one of those people who aren't all that into theme parks, I came to to the park thinking this was the one place that would change my mind...it is supposed to be the happiest place on Earth after all right? Well, nope. Everything was just EH.",
          "We love it so much! We used to go every month when we lived in So Cal. Now we can only go maybe once a year if we are lucky due to distance. It's such a wonderful place to be and spend time. We raised our kids at the park and they all love it too.",
          "Love Disneyland Park. So much to do. Definitely need a few days here. Especially if you go to both parks. Everyone is usually pretty friendly and the park is always clean.",
          "Love it what can I say was my first time going and had a blast with the hubby I would say in the near future we will be going again",
          "There is no place to smoke in the park. This bothers me as you can get beer or wine and drink it anywhere. Not really fair for all of us considering everyone else gets some free pass to do whatever. There should be a place for everyone. And \u2026",
          "I a 75 year old grandfather visited Disneyland with my two adult daughters who both still have children at home.  We had an incredibly wonderful time.  It was like we passed through a time warp and became young children again.  My tech \u2026",
          "Kids enjoy the place the most, lots of rides and games to play. Ample of parking around the Disneyland, every ride is having the facility to accommodate people of determination. Lot of shops to do shopping in the shopping market inside the \u2026",
          "The ticket prices for busier times is a little crazy considering it's already expensive! However paying the extra $ for the fast pass was worth it, just for the pictures alone! Although it was the busiest time, it was also decorated \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth is no lie. It is quite expensive but every time I go I feel that I spent my money well and I am always satisfied. I also feel that by making the park expensive it keeps it nice. The workers are always so kind and \u2026",
          "Mid week is definitely a great time to go to avoid crowds and long wait times. Unfortunately you miss out on some shows such as Mickey's Magical Map.\nIf you are trying to get on the new Star Wars ride- Resistance be sure to get the \u2026",
          "For as many times I have been there; I do believe it is the ambiance, atmosphere and the food which keeps drawing me back.  Went on the Rise of the Resistance ride.  A bit confusing on the boarding pass as there are several screens to click \u2026",
          "There really is no place in the world that compares to Disneyland. The imagineers and everybody involved in creating this magical place really put their heart and soul into it. For the whole day, we allowed ourselves to be kids again and \u2026",
          "fun but can't travel on Google maps \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udcaf",
          "It makes me so happy and all the people there are always so helpful. You get your money's worth and so much more. It may be crowded but that is just because everyone loves it.",
          "Can't really put into words on how the family and I felt going here for the first time. It was truly magical.  Everyone is so friendly and glad to see you. The only bad parts was the heat which has nothing to do with the park itself and the \u2026",
          "This is one place you got to visit once in your lifetime. Can't talk enough about the fun I had on those rides at Indiana Jones Adventure, Space Mountain, Water Splash, Star Wars Spaceship Ride. It would take you 2 days minimum to have a go \u2026",
          "I love anything Disney. I've never been to Disneyland and was disappointed that the wait for rides were 90 minutes. Their just taking your money and there were too many people in the park to not be a fire hazard. I'm only going to Disney world for now on. I don't like the other parks.",
          "Very enjoyable experience in Disneyland. This theme park will guarantee you some fun with your family as you dive in to some great theme rides. Disneyland is also massive to begin with so have fun as you explore the areas involved in Disneyland.",
          "This is a must when you go to Los Angeles since it's the original Disney. If you have been to Disney World in Florida you will notice the difference.  Disneyland is smaller than the one In Florida but it was great. They have the Star Wars section.  The Christmas parade was excellent.",
          "Great park but lacking on making people aware of the new Star War Land behind Adventure Land , no signs bringing it to your attention so you automatically go to Tomorrow Land thinking the revamped Star Tours is it....plus when we found the \u2026",
          "Still the best theme park in America. Rise of the Resistance was amazing!",
          "Always a fun magical place! \nHowever, save your money and don't buy your kids one of those cool looking balloons! They are expensive and helium lasts about 1 day. We purchased one a Saturday night on our way out of the park, by Monday it \u2026",
          "I love Disneyland! I will always go to Disneyland. There are a few things to remember, mostly that Disneyland is ALWAYS crowded and you will ALWAYS have to wait in a long line: to get in, to get on any ride, for food, for a snack, to buy a \u2026",
          "By far the happiest place on earth! Love it all, family is everything and Disneyland is a great place to come and enjoy it with family.\nChristmas season is the best time, but be ready for long lines almost every day.\nLoved Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, all the details, characters and the vibe.",
          "Eh...It's a great amusement park.",
          "It truly is the happiest place on earth, I tell people I lived at Disneyland. When I was young we lived close by we came all the time. I was just there with my grandchildren and hadn't been for over 20 years and I loved every minute of it all over again.",
          "Rides were great \nQueues were not, especially the 40 minutes to buy entry tickets (Online were not going to be ready in time). \nQueue times inside long, and as expected. \nFast pass great on the rides it was available for\n\nLove Star Wars \u2026",
          "I've been a big fan of Disneyland for a very long time. The max pass is definitely worth it. I've got it on every ticket or annual pass and it's definitely been used.",
          "Obviously, the happiest place on earth has to be my favorite. A perfect place to go with family or even yourself. Everyone greets with a smile and it makes everything so magical.",
          "I Love this place so much I want to go there to have a fun time",
          "New Star Wars area is next planet level! The Milleneum Falcon was close enough to touch. This new area alone is worth the trip. Park Hopper is a good value if you are a veteran & max pass is well worth it for the pictures alone, but digital food reservations, wait times & fast pass too. Go Disney!",
          "The happiest place on earth is of course great as you would expect.  We went on the busiest day of 2019 and the park stopped selling tickets before we even got into th parking structure at 10AM.  It was also cold.  Staff was always \u2026",
          "Its the happiest place! Always a fun visit. Fun treats, cool new merchandise and many photo opportunities. Create memories!",
          "Almost unbelievable busy, but still fun even as an adult. Galaxy's edge is by far the coolest part of the park, I recommend it for any Star Wars fan.  Would rather go at night than during the day.",
          "I love it so much. The place is awesome. You just have to prepare to get wet, have lots of fun, photos and videos. You will be in for a great treat.",
          "Truly the happiest place on earth.\nLike so much better than Disney World.\nLoved the parades.\nWould suggest more character personell.\nThose we saw were on the run and did not give small children time to interact.\nWould visit again and recommend everyone  visit early.",
          "I've been coming here since I was a small child. The new Galaxy's Edge is amazing, the Rise of the Resistance ride is the most incredible experience, especially if you're a lover of Star Wars.\nThe New Orleans area has some cool French looking spots with great views and delicious food.",
          "The riverbelle restaurant in adventure land is to die for. It's a little pricey but worth it. The food the service and the atmosphere is excellent. The food has the taste of New Orleans. Very clean. Kids meals are reasonable.",
          "Always enjoying being here, yes its a bit expensive but you're at Disneyland enjoy yourselves. One thing id recommend doing is getting the Disney app and buying the max pass its 100% worth it get fast pass tickets whenever, wherever. Mobile \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth for all ages! So much fun, bring comfy walking shoes and water and some patience. Awesome vacation spot, service and overall experience is amazing.",
          "Not quite the happiest place on earth anymore. Love it but it\u2019s so overpriced now and the lines are so long that it\u2019s not really worth it anymore. If you go, go very early. You\u2019ll be able to go on a few rides early. Get there before they \u2026",
          "Great for kids and adults really into Disney. I came for my 3 year old and she LOVED IT! Must warn you, if you have small children come early so they can nap in the afternoon and go at it again to take advantage of the day.",
          "I\u2019ve gone there almost every year for my birthday \ud83c\udf81 and I almost 3 my first time I loved it the roller coasters are so fun there and the new Star Wars land was so fun and the rooms in the hotel were so nice also I was always so scared \ud83d\ude31 at first and at the end I took it back and rood it again!!!!!",
          "What a breathtaking adventure! I was able to live out my childhood dreams and enjoy Disney with my own children. This is a place to make memories, have fun and enjoy each other's company. We'll be back in the future. Definitely the happiest place on Earth!",
          "It has been busier than expected, but we have loved our time here! Smuggler's Run is not worth it, but the excitement for Rise of the Resistance is pretty great! Be sure to get here well before the park opens to get the a place to have a \u2026",
          "It's Disneyland, it's a great place to make amazing memories. Get there early and enjoy the time when lines are shorter. don't forget to relax and enjoy the small things and all the magic.",
          "it was amazing ive been their 2 times and i ad so many good memorys there",
          "It is very, very fun to go here. Highly recommend. Mickey Mouse is one of the nicest mice that I know, and really rolls out the red carpet for the guests of this park.",
          "It\u2019s the happiest place on earth. Had a blast, lost my glasses but they have a great lost and found program. Thanks Disneyland.",
          "As much as I LOVE Disneyland and all that it represents for my family and I, it gets more and more expensive each time we go from the merchandise to the food and entrance. It's hard to love something that expensive, especially with two \u2026",
          "Disneyland the 24 of December is unique! You have to go, you\u2019ll never forget that experience! Is the happiest place or the world. Now Disneyland have more and more games, also Star Wars!, so if you want to see like 80% of everything you \u2026",
          "Closed during quarantine but the streets are much cleaner around the outside now!",
          "I have always loved Disneyland since I was a kid. It is only as an adult than I have been able to experience another side To the place I knew and loved. The shops the architecture the rides  All these things sharing them with others Is a welcome break from my 9 to 5.",
          "It really is an amazing and magical place to be.\nI was there from 7am to try and get a spot on the Rose of the resistance ride and was there until closing.\nAnd I enjoyed every second I was there",
          "Some people have second homes they keep up and pay on to visit once a year or more. We chose Disneyland as our second home instead. For 25 years our children and my husband and I have cherished every aspect from the shows, tours, \u2026",
          "Awesome place. I strongly recommend to go at least once. Take advantage of the Fast passes, and pay attention to the line at smuggler's run. Galaxy's edge can get extremely crowded on popular days.",
          "Always a fun day at Disneyland...rain or shine! But especially great during the holidays! Arrive early for your best chance to beat the crowds and stay late to ride at night with hardly a line left.",
          "I love Disneyland. Its super fun to go. The new star wars land is amazing! The detail that the people put into this place is amazing.",
          "Terrible Customer Service and Empathy.   I purchased park tickets in advance online.   Park was closed due to COVID 19.   Customer service said tickets are non-refundable and rudely hung up on me.   DON'T EVER PURCHASE TICKETS ONLINE IN \u2026",
          "One of many times I\u2019ve been to Disneyland over thanksgiving break! My family always gets there early in the morning and get to ride rides before it gets too busy! \nLoved the new star wars addition they have, only one of the rides was open when we went but I\u2019m sure once it is complete it will be even more exciting!!!",
          "Brilliant venue that lives up to the hype. Impeccably clean and well maintained, everything is considered in context to the theme. Fast pass mobile app system is fantastic and worked very well allowing us to get on all rides multiple times. \u2026",
          "Their prices have gone up again...people pay zero attention to you if you are in a wheelchair or scooter. Be careful when navigating in the part because people will just cut you off walk in front of you....don't eat at Carnation Plaza..a \u2026",
          "Home away from home! Great value for the price. It is very festive. The price for al day digital photos done by their own professional photographers is worth it! The rides never grow old. Great place to vacation",
          "I mean it's Disney.. it was awesome.  The new Galaxy's Edge is beautifully done and the new rides are super fun.  If you have kids and are traveling you should try to take a couple days to go through the park, and hotel nearby for naps.",
          "Took my son there for his birthday. We had so much fun! Cant wait until we go again in the future",
          "Happiest place on Earth for a reason. It definitely brings me back to my childhood everytime I go. Lines are a little long, but the Disney Play app helps with that!",
          "HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!! After having been to Disney World a couple times, I didn't think Disney Land would be worth the cost, but being a Disney girl and absolute Star Was fanatic, I had to go while I was nearby for work. It was amazing! \u2026",
          "who doesn't love Disneyland?! Love that you can pack snacks. Lines were long despite \"off season.\" The new Star Wars area is fantastic. Worth the money.",
          "Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth! We love going! So many generations of memories and happiness! The magic is ingrained in every bit of the design, the cast & the shows! It's the best family holiday!",
          "The Star Wars area is amazing! You feel like you're actually walking around the movie set!",
          "We try to go to Disneyland at least 3 times a year. The park is always clean. The workers are always cheerful. The food is great to some and not so great to others. Plan ahead and look at the food menus. I myself love everything about Disneyland.",
          "I went during the holidays, I know this is one of the busier times of year, but it's simply too crowded for the price of the tickets. They should limit attendance so those who are in the park can actually enjoy their time. \n\nThe new Star \u2026",
          "Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision \u2026",
          "I focused on the new Star War area and they did not disappoint! The entire set was perfect with so much details from the movies and the lores. The rides are probably the best themed rides I.have ever experienced. Even though there is long \u2026",
          "Characters are fun to interact with and they maintain this place so amazingly well it's unbelievable. Everything's clean and line management is top priority. It's nice that the whole family can enjoy one place, if only everyone agreed where to eat then it truly would be the happiest place on earth.",
          "It's the happiest place on Earth. I don't know how much more to say about it, but I'll try... Of you can't handle people or lines, it isn't the place for you, but if you're relatively mellow, and can handle walking around, lines, and people \u2026",
          "Very suitable for kids! \nYou will feel super happy being here\nRemember to pick up 1st visit button or other celebrations buttons!! They are free!!\nUse mobile app to keep tracking the line up time, show times, character showing up...etc",

          "Rise of the Resistance is an absolute must! It wasn't just a ride, it was an experience! Be sure to be in the park before 8:00 AM with the Disneyland app loaded on your phone to maximize your chances of getting a good boarding group!",
          "I\u2019ve been here two times, one in 2016 and recently, this past summer. I love this place so much. It\u2019s literally my home and I would love to come back one day. There\u2019s always something new in the parks and it just gets better every time! \u2026",
          "How can you not love Disneyland??? The Rise of the Resistance blew my mind and I cannot recommend enough that you spend money on a 2-3 day pass and arrive at least an hour and a half early to make it in time for the group boarding join up \u2026",
          "Happiest Place on Earth\nWe went to the original Disneyland park and was able to fully experience the \u201cmagic\u201d in a day. \n\nTips to going to Disney would definitely be planning a timeline and attractions that are a \u201cmust see\u201d for your family. \u2026",
          "The new Max Pass makes getting Fast Passes from your phone so easy. We rode a ton of rides without too much running around! Galaxy's Edge is insane and the 2 rides there are unbelievable!",

          "Love the park for my son obviously. It lives up to its motto, \"The Happiest Place on Earth\". Season passports is the way to go if you live anywhere in Los Angeles County, or Orange County. The food is great of course but seasonal so each \u2026",
          "A simple review just won't be enough. The beauty, the detail and the overall experience was absolutely amazing. We got the fast pass and it was worth it. So many rides are so popular that they need a fast pass so you don't spend your day \u2026",
          "Who wouldn't love going to Disney Land. It's known as a magical place and it is. Not only can every are find something exciting to see, but they also offer wait for those who need wheel chairs or strollers or other options to travel through \u2026",
          "What is there to say about the most magical place on earth? My favorite park to visit, with always something new to discover. When I visit Disneyland, it feels like I\u2019m coming home. When I leave, I\u2019m already thinking about when I can come back again.",
          "A totally amazing place for kids and adults but prepare to sell a kidney or some other organ since that is how much you will be spending. It can be very overwhelming to figure out. The food was not very good not but I was unable to go to some of the better establishments.",
          "Where do I begin... they call it the happiest place on earth for a reason. I have too many stories of how amazing that place and their cast members (employees) are... Just wonderful.",
          "Disneyland is a wonderful place for people of all ages to visit. While the park is on the more expensive side, you\u2019re paying for the experience. Expect great customer service, cleanliness, a safe atmosphere, and overall fun!",
          "This of course is the best place on earth, just wish it was not so expensive. It makes it so we will only go once every couple of years when you can do so much else for less money. The kids enjoyed it but wow what a price tag.",
          "A very grand and awesome experience. I like this park very much. The rides, shows, architectures are very good.\nAlthough most of attractions are children based, it is suitable for people of all ages and if you are coming in groups, you will \u2026",
          "We visited Disneyland Resort this holiday season for the first time. The staff are well-trained, knowledgeable, and accommodating. They seem to know what to do in every situation and they can control the crowd without being rude or nasty. \u2026",
          "Every time, I go to Disneyland I get this happy feeling that I love. It is a feeling that makes you feel that everything is going to be alright. \n\nDisneyland is a great theme park with a timeless feel to it. It is a place for everyone to go and enjoy.",
          "Staff are also very friendly and prompt and would usually greet us every time they would see us. I had had a long and stressful day and once we checked in here and were greeted by the friendly staff and saw our room, I knew that this was a great pick, I highly recommend this hotel!",
          "First time experiencing the Halloween in Disney! I enjoyed the Mansion, Coco's show, and every other ride. I had the park hopper ticket for 1 day. It's A LOT of rides.. and a lot of waiting. I would suggest to do two days :) I went on a \u2026",
          "Fantastic park for adults and children alike. No stress from fastpasses (other than Rise of the Resistance boarding groups), amazing atmosphere and full of history. It's expensive but certainly worth the price to experience at least once",
          "Who doesn't love Disneyland?? It's the happiest place on earth. I had a great time. The lines are extremely long and the wait time for most rides are at least an hour and a half. I love to go to people watch so that doesn't bother me. Food and snacks are good. I love the Halloween decorations around the entire park. It's fabulous!",
          "Parking at their Mickey and Friends lots is $25 (kind of expensive when you have to buy a ticket as well). Place is great, the same as always. Lines are never too long at this park like they are in Orlando and Tokyo. The family always enjoys visiting.",
          "ok so look i havent been here but everytime i go its so nice. i like the churros here. the candy apple are super cool too. the princesses \ud83d\udc78 and projces \ud83e\udd34 are super nice. i like the stores and going into them, i got some funko things from there \ud83d\ude0a. cant wait to go, im going there next uear for the first time. \ud83c\udf32",

          "The fast pass is great but making reservations needs a little bit of getting used to, even for experts, not unless you live in Disneyland every day. I recommend 1 park per day, but if you're a rider you probably need the fast pass and 4 days with the hopper.",
          "Disneyland park is in a league of its own. Amazing to walk down the same streets conceptualized and enjoyed by Walt Disney himself. Outstanding service, superb cleanliness, complete inclusiveness to those with disabilities and an immersive and magical environment like no other.",
          "Great and fun place if you are into amusement parks. Miss having an annual pass but it can be pricey. Inside certain things can be pricey too but it's a famous place so it is expected that some things would be pricey. If you are into parks tho, it's certainly worth it.",
          "All the staff are super heplful and nice. Place is so clean despite all the people, even the bathrooms. Lines move fairly quickly even at busy times. Stay for the parade at the end of the day, its magical.",

          "It's always a great experience at Disneyland, this time we went to Sweethearts Night and we had a great time. There is a reason why it's the happiest place on Earth. Now if only they could stop raising prices that'd be great.",
          "Their experience never fails. Seeing my daughter\u2018s smile and her happiness is priceless. \n\nI wish they can upgrade food quality and assortment tho. People visit from all over the places around the world and food offerings could be \u2026",
          "As they say..... it's the happiest place on Earth, and it is!  Very clean, crowd management is good, not great food places so far.  That's the only down side.",

          "Disneyland is an amazing place! Great layout and with the Disney app you can see wait times and order food ahead of time. Rise of the Resistance is a fun, massive set!",
          "Pricey, but all parks are.  We had a great time with our kids.  The Cars area makes you feel like you are part of the movie.",
          "Long wait times as usual, however fast pass makes make rides bearable. Galaxy's edge was awesome. The architecture is amazing. Disney has spent a lot of money to making this as close to movie as possible. It will give the feeling to \u2026",
          "Whenever I visit it's like my other home or happy place. \nJust like Walt said \"To all that come to this happy place, welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and \u2026",

          "Always 5 stars. Beautiful at night and charming and fun in the day! As long as you keep perspective, it really can be the \"happiest place on Earth!\".",
          "Disney Land is just Amazing. Had Great time. Every thing was on point. I recommend you get fast pass to get ahead of the game",
          "Been here with a bm at last year. Very beautiful place, made a lot of photos. I was pleased with the trip. I hope someday I'll be able to visit here again. :)",
          "Love Disneyland!  Season passes this year and we can\u2019t stop going. Vegan food option and so much to see and do. Love Galaxy\u2019s Edge, Smuggler\u2019a Run is amazing and can\u2019t wait to ride Rise if the Resistance. Couldn\u2019t get on yet. And if you haven\u2019t seen the Haunted Mansion at Halloween is the best ride ever!!!",
          "Do I need to tell about Disneyland? I think no need especially in USA. It worth every dollar you spend! The staff are very friendly and very kind and helpful . Disneyland in USA is different!!",
          "The attention to detail in all Disneyland attractions just makes the experience so special and memorable \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 It's nice they have mobile apps for Fast Passes and real time waiting times for the rides. Mobility for the guests make the park \u2026",
          "Greatest amusement park experience. Yes everything is overpriced. Yes its crazy busy. But it's worth it. My family and I love Disney and my fave vacations have taken place here!",
          "It's Disneyland. It definitely earns the reputation for the most magical place on Earth.\n\n I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I love Black Spire Outpost. I feel, however, they should have some shows and more activities, as the entire area feels \u2026",
          "Great experience. Quite many amazing rides, including for adults. Plan well if you intend to cover as much as possible in single go.\n\nNew theme called Star wars: Galaxy's edge is astonishingly real like. Must go!!",
          "We kicked off the New Year at Disneyland, counting down just before midnight. They always have a pretty fantastic fireworks display and very lively entertainment for the New Year's Eve / New Year celebration. The only downside is how densely packed it got leading up to midnight.",
          "Amazing. Awesome. Fantastic. Magical. Yea. Annual pass is pretty expensive and I have to give up pretty much everything for it but HEY! This place is pretty worth it.",
          "1st time back in 10 years always the happiest place on earth",
          "I don\u2019t know how much reviews for Disneyland matter for cast members because I am sure that the profit is there you all know you are doing something right, but the woman named Alex with the short hair who worked Wednesday the 19th of \u2026",
          "The food was good. The shows were fun and entertaining. But my wife and son are extremely happen I was able to provide an awesome vacation to an awesome place. Highly recommend using of the free fast pass service to optimize your time. Take \u2026",
          "What more to say than it\u2019s the happiest place on earth! A great place to spend some time after work or just walking around getting some exercise in. I love coming here for beignets!",
          "My boyfriend had never been and I use to go all the time as a kid but hadn't been in about three years. Im sad that Bug's Life is no longer a part of the park, but I understand that there is a certain need for growth. The Star Wars Land \u2026",
          "What can I say? It\u2019s Disneyland and it\u2019s the best. Somehow it\u2019s able to overcome huge crowds and long lines, and still deliver an incredible experience. Bringing back the Electrical Parade was brilliant, and even the renovation of the \u2026",
          "Some staff kinda nasty. Also mega overpriced, like you will go broke in 2 hours. But still pretty memorable and epic.",
          "Loved every minute even with long lines. Gave us a chance to meet new people and to make new connections with other cultures from all over the world. Would have been better if there was a bit more Beauty and the Beast themed items and was able to \"catch\" all the characters but was still amazing.",
          "Came during Christmas time and obviously Disneyland is great and magical  especially for photos. The decorations were really festive and the castle looked amazing. We got the fastpass this time but you have to schedule the rides at a time \u2026",
          "The Rise of the Resistance ride is SO worth the wait!!! Won't give too much away, just want to say;\nIt's like being in an actual Star Wars movie!!!\nWell done Disney well done!",
          "Prices are outrageous, but it can't be denied that the value at Disneyland is undeniable, from Broadway quality shows, prestine parks, and rides that go above and beyond to provide the best experience, every staff member is ridiculously \u2026",
          "I was expecting a whole lot more Christmas decorations put around the park the main focus is the castle and main street. It's my first time coming to Disneyland for Christmas and I would of hoped for more decorations to keep that magical \u2026",

          "Always love Disney! I've only been to Disney world but my first time in Disneyland is so different because it was all brand new to me! I love Disney in it's entirety and it was worth coming from the eat coast with my family! We loved the \u2026",
          "Disneyland is full of magic and whimsy. If you haven't been what are you waiting for? Be careful tho because once you've gone you will have to go again and again and again....",
          "I don't know where to begin... Disneyland is amazing! So many things and places to see. All Disney staff were great and very helpful. Looking forward to returning to Disneyland!",
          "Always a great time at Disneyland! Unlike almost every other amusement park, their strength is strongly creating a fully immersive, themed experience for the entire park, and the rides. Visiting Galaxy's Edge is really like stepping into \u2026",
          "I love Disneyland!!! The lines may be long but they are so worth it! I'm sure everyone has heard of \"The magic of Disneyland\" but this place really is amazing! All the rides are so fun and the ferris wheel is extraordinary!",
          "I LOVE Disneyland! I\u2019m born and raised in Orange County. Disneyland has been a wonderful place in my life since I was very young. Yes, it\u2019s pricey but it is truly quality entertainment. Everything is clean and well maintained. Every time I \u2026",
          "Its Disneyland. Pricey, but it just has a magic to it that's worth the money. An amazing experience, fun rides, not the best theme park food, but if you can manage the th Blue Bayou restaurant, it's amazing. If your more of a thrill seeker \u2026",
          "Does this place even need a review?  If you don't already know what it is, you need to just go and experience it because no reviews can explain how magical a place can be. Where every adult can be a kid. Where every kid can find something \u2026",
          "Star wars land is awesome.  Millennium falcon ride was good, except that you've waited in line for an hour and then once you get inside the falcon to the checker-type board, etc. They RUSH you through. We had maybe 45 seconds in there and \u2026",
          "What can you say. If you like crowds and amusement parks you should go. The new Star Wars themed area was very cool if you're a fan. Oh yeah,  super expensive just like you'd expect.",
          "New Star Wars area was Awesome! Wife and daughter are going back next week for princess birthday. Goofy kitchen was a lot of fun too!",
          "Amazing experience for all ages. Make sure to be ready to spend a lot of money beyond your entry ticket. Most activities are still $$ as they are usually workshops to build your droid or your light saber. Other attractions are mainly shops \u2026",
          "This wonderful magical place made all my stress, worries, sadness, and negative thoughts go away. Every second I spent in this park I had a wonderful time. The rides keep you on your toes and let you have the time of your life. I highly recommend this park to anyone, it worth the price!",
          "I always feel like I'm 12 when I come here. I am the one with the nose ring. We always stay over 12 hours, and it only feels like 20 minutes...til the next day, as you can see I am NOT 12.\ud83d\ude1d",
          "A star quality park that's known all around the world! Everything is expansive but it's right in front of you. This is the happiest place in the world!",
          "Got to see the new Star Wars ride and it was really cool. One of my very favorites is soaring over the world but it's too short. They should add back on soaring over California in my opinion. The food is good but extremely expensive. They \u2026",
          "Some rides were great. Fast pass was not worth the money. Only let us book one at time, so didnt save us any time from waiting in lines.  The people with the photographers were, especially near the the Castle.  Disney world is much better for the money and much larger.",
          "Laughter is a magical elixir... Our family heals the wounds life inflicts on us walking around the park.  Screaming gasping for breath and giggling is a great formula for mental health.  If you have the need for FUN... Disneyland can provide a good fix.  Go have a spoon full of sugar....\nLaugh until your eyes leak!!!!!",
          "Happiest place on earth!  I love being there just to breathe the air.  It;s truly amazing.",
          "3  months ago my family and I visited disneyland and loved it. The lines went relatively quickly given we didn't have fast passes, however, Fast passes definitely would have come to use given you still have to wait 30 minutes for one ride. \u2026",
          "Love Disneyland/DCA there is always something to do for all ages from infant to an adult. It does get crowded time to time but keep yourself informed with other updates on how packed it can get. Disney magic everywhere. Every personal in the park is interactive and wonderful must take pictures with what you can.",
          "Amazing park. Bring your kids. Or don't. It's disneyland.\nCastle was under construction when I went. Rides are pretty good. It's like another world in that place. I was kinda overwhelmed at the fireworks. Amazing for anyone! \nI, for one, welcome our corporate overlords.",
          "The original Disney park, great new Star Wars attractions. Park is especially nice to visit during the winter holidays. As with everything Disney, the attention to detail is incredible. Expensive but the experience is worth the money.",
          "Haunted Mansion holiday and got to experience the new Star Wars Galaxy's Edge part of the park. Amazing!!!!! Everything you've dreamed of and the Droid customization center is fantastic. A bit pricey but worth the money for what you get to build from scratch!",
          "I had a great time. The max pass really is worth buying. The longest we waited in line was 1 hour.",
          "Very helpful for customer with disabilities. I am not a fan of going to Disneyland. I actually would rather go to the DMV.  Yes, I dislike it that much. BUT, my family rather enjoys Disneyland. So, for them I go. I was very impressed with \u2026",
          "This park is mostly for families with kids and not for adults.  It is not worth the price of admission.  The Guardians of the Galaxy is the same as the tower of terror with a different facade...literally!!! I his is nothing like Disney \u2026",
          "This review is long overdue, but I just had to contribute. My family & I visited on July 2019, so we're approaching the 1 yr mark. We had an absolute blast. I think I had more fun than my 16 month old. We enjoyed seeing all of the \u2026",
          "As always happiest place in the world. New rides are great. Hyperspace mountain, millennium falcon and it's a small world are the best. Been multiple times, max pass through Disney app was live saver. Skipped long lines.",
          "In my opinion, it is really the happiest place on earth. Disney characters have been embedded in almost every child's memory and dreams for several generations now -- internationally.  This theme park brought out my inner child. Glad that my family was here with me to share that awesome joy.",
          "I'm not going to say we had a bad time, but it is not the happiest place on earth. The nostalgic part of the experience would be the main reason for going, however the cast members are not nearly as accommodating  as Disney World. Once \u2026",
          "The place and people is great except for a person in the city hall. I asked for a way to wait less in line due to my disability she refused to see my disabled permit she said I needed to rent a wheelchair outside and use the wheelchair to \u2026",
          "Lots of people, lots of lines, lots of expenses. That's the magic of the place. Yeah, most attractions are good, but there's no way to justify an average of an hour in line, and the \"fast passes\" in the app will work once in a blue moon. If it wasn't as expensive it may almost be worthwhile.",
          "A wonderful place to enjoy time with the family, it feels enchantingly amazing the moment you walk through Main st.  Disney found a way to make visiting Disneyland affordable with Annual Pass, by upgrading my family's day pass to an annual \u2026",
          "Magic is created by hardworking staffs. Place is really clean even it is full with crowds. \n\nShows, rides and food. \n\nHappiest place on earth.  When it is not too busy.",
          "I absolutely love Disneyland my dad worked at Disney for 42 years and ABC so we get to go all the time sometimes the cast members can be rude but most of them are very nice they have awesome food and one of the best rides I would 10 out of 10 recommend you can have a nice family trip and have lots of fun!!!",
          "First, and last time I went to Disneyland I was like 9 years old.   Was fun going again as an adult.  Have been to Disney World a ton of times over the years but it was kinda fun going back to the first Disney again \ud83d\ude01",
          "Only giving this park 4 stars because I appreciate Disney World better. 4 stars is not a bad review. Great park.",
          "Had a great day at Disneyland today! Got a seven hour personal tour, ate lunch at 1901, dinner at Club 33 restaurant, and watched World of Color (not to mention all the lines I got to skip). One of the most memorable days here in a long time.",
          "The most magical place. Ever. The rides. The characters. The themes. The smells. The fun. This place exists to serve joy. And joy it is. What an incredible place on earth. Now they just need World of Pandora",
          "I went here a couple years ago. The place is awesome! There is no trash on the ground and everything is near spotless. The staff are above and beyond helpful. The food is super expensive but it tastes soooo good! The rides are fun and they \u2026",
          "I will just copy my California adventure post because they are basically one and the same. I\u2019d give it 5 but it is so over priced and the wait times are sooo ridiculous. And the fast pass is hit and miss. I\u2019ll quote a fellow reviewer \u2026",
          "Staff was great. The rides were amazing. But prices are ridiculous. And not being able to add a parking pass to the lower annual passes just shows the greed on the part of the Disney upper brass.",
          "Great magical atmosphere you don\u2019t get anywhere else, but extremely over priced and far too crowded, you can go on rides and pay for over priced food at other places and still get an amazing experience",
          "Nothing compares to Disneyland. The crowds are insane most of the time, but it is still MAGICAL each time we visit. As annual pass holders, we have learned to navigate the busy by enjoying the decor, taking in a show, watching a parade and \u2026",
          "Disney is always a 5 star experience. Guest satisfaction and happiness is always their top priority. One downside is how indescribably packed it gets but that's expected.",
          "Always fun, the dining experiences have gotten worse every year though. The increase prices, serve less food, and service has gotten worse at all dining. But we still love the rides and the whole experience.",
          "Without fail, this place puts a smile on my face every time. From the moment you enter the park, you are transported into a different world of childhood and magic. Such a good place...reminds me of being a kid again.",
          "Found out When you hear this is \"the happiest place on earth\" it is not a lie! Went with 3 kids under the age of 10, and seeing their faces light up when meeting princesses and Mickey/minnie mouse makes any amount of money you could spend not even matter. I now cannot wait to to come back when they are older and see it all over again!",
          "Honestly I just didn't feel the magic this time we went I came to check out the star wars land with my family and while it was alright it definitely didn't meet up with all the hype then we figured might as well get our money's worth and \u2026",

          "Our family loves going to Disneyland. The new Star Wars land is amazing!  They knocked it out of the park; the storm troopers are really funny.  As everyone knows, Disney is way overpriced, so you just have to be prepared for that ahead of time.",
          "Amazing park. Always too short time to see and feel everything. Until next time!",
          "We loved this park and California Adventures.  Rise of the Resistance was the newest ride and hard to get a ticket for. Once we did (we had a 3 day pass so went back to this park) I was underwhelmed. I felt the millenium falcon smugglers \u2026",

          "I dont like the really scary, high thriller type of rides, so disneyland was actually perfect as the rides were more of an experience than thrill seeking. Such intricate details in to each ride experience. The swamp ride was so much fun and the lad running it was hilarious.",
          "It was magical, as always. Get there early, just after the \"magical hour\" and you can get a front row position, but beware for the ultimate \"die hard\" Disneyland fans they come in packs and they know what they are doing. Take advantage of the Maxpass it's always worth the extra $$, and as always, have fun and be safe. Cheers.",
          "An amazing place, would totally recommend. Tickets though are very expensive and there is trash practically everywhere but I can't blame them. Either way, it was and is a very fun experience.",
          "Had a great time at Disneyland. Usually can get on a lot of rides with no Fast Pass in the mornings. After that I use FastPass and just coordinate each ride. Make sure to bring snacks and water bottles, the food in the park is pricey. Just love the overall experience of Disneyland!",

          "I have a huge issue.  We bought on a \"slow\" day and it was packed.   We paid 179 a ticket per person and rode 5 rides.   I am very disappointed as I used to be an annual ticket holder and loved it. With the \"have\" to buy max pass because the big fast pass areas were shut down...wow..I wont be back for some time.",
          "Truly the most magical place to take the children and bring the utmost joy. Yes, it can be overwhelming at times and the prices are a bit high but it is so very worth it to see the smiles on all of the kid's faces. If you haven't been you must go and I thank everyone on their staff for such a wonderful experience for my children.",
          "Great fun for all ages. Visited both parks for four days. Family had a great time, lots to do and see. Be patient as lines can be very long at peak times.  Bring your own food as well as park prices are very expensive. One star off for the high prices on food and souvenirs.",
          "We went for only a day and for all the hype I wasn't that impressed. But it is meant for kids though so as long as our granddaughter had a great time its all good.Maybe if we went for longer it could be better.  I think all the characters should be out and about more than they are",
          "As usual, Disneyland is an excellent destination to spend quality time with your family... But unfortunately you will also be spending a small fortune! Due to the unique offerrings such as Galaxy's Edge, however, it is well worth the Money. Absolutely, recommended.",
          "As long as you come prepared and with a plan on what you want to tackle and when, you'll have a good time. If you just want to wander and take photos, you'll also be fine. Don't expect to wing it and get into the rides you want though.",
          "Very nice and very clean.  Well organized.  Crowded,  but that's half the fun. Parades off the charts great. \nStarwars rode way way cool",

          "How can I give it anything BUT 5 stars? \n\nThis is such a classic location that is fun for the whole family. The fireworks are beautiful and the rides are so much fun.",
          "I hate to say it but after being to Disney world. It just doesn't compare. It was fine for the one quick day but all it did was make me wish I was at Disney world \ud83d\ude14",
          "Going on Black Friday did not help with lines. Star Wars Galaxy's Edge was very realistic and highly recommend stopping by this land. The cast members are always very friendly and helpful. Great for a family or even a date.",
          "It's always an amazing experience at Disneyland. So many characters to see and fun rides to explore. I only had one small problem, the restaurant next to starwars ride, I had a bad experience. As I was choosing my option in food, the ladies \u2026",
          "Commercials says happiest place on earth, but not all workers representing Disneyland Park are in great customer service focused, or Spirits. We the customers make it happy and amazing because we don't pay so much to not enjoy ourselves: No \u2026",
          "This place is full of joy. From watching the kids light up when they meet they're favorite characters, to the level of detail that is put into everything, Disney doesn't disappoint.",
          "O my God wonderful but arrive early for.starwars",
          "This is easily one of my favorite rides in California adventures. For those who have a dear of heights it might not be ideal, bit for me it was great to get my feet off the ground for a bit after all the traipsing across the parks and \u2026",
          "Disneyland Park is on the Top of our list of places that we truly enjoy.  My family has visited the theme park a few times and while there ALWAYS asks me to stay longer.  I recommend going up for at least two days to get the full Disney experience.",
          "Disneyland has always been a special place for all the great moments we had and memories we made with our boys. Today it became one of the most special because it is where I thanked my wife for 20 wonderful years of marriage and the 3 \u2026",
          "Wonderful place! It has a lot of great attractions to offer to public and I spent the whole day there. One of the most amazing rides is the Star Wars ride where it is the most fun part ever. Waiting time is usually 30 mins to 1 hr. I \u2026",
          "It had been 11 years since my last visit. Long overdue and well worth it even if it was for a short time. Crowd was decent and for what I did, no line was longer than 30 minutes. The best part for me was Savi's Workshop. What an awesome and unique experience. I will do it again.",
          "Best place ever!!!! Most helpful staff that truly make it an unforgettable experience. Awesome theme park with fun rides. Definitely get a hotel outside the park to save money, but the park is amazing!!!",
          "This was my first visit to Disneyland Park, it was a wonderful experience. We get there early and it wasn't too crowded, get to enjoy the time when lines are shorter.",
          "What not to love about Disneyland? Cant go wrong and they are incorporating Vegan friendly foods throughout the park. Check out Happiest Vegan On Earth on YouTube for what to eat and how to order vegan.",
          "I mean, need I see more, this is the happiest place on earth and I still can't get over the detail, experience, the kindness of the staff, how authentic the characters are, how happy everybody is, and how great the visual, authentic \u2026",
          "Happiest Place on Earth!  Absolutely true.  I love this place.  Cast members are amazing, the food is good, the experiences are unmatched.",
          "Recently, the nostalgia has stopped flooding over me when walking through these vaunted gates, but I don't know if that's me or Disney. I do find a lack of the same level of craftsmanship in the Galaxy's Edge. It's too easy to find the \u2026",
          "Oh my god. The happiest place on earth is here! Extremely fun, DELICIOUS dessert (probably my favorite part was dessert) Anyone who has not been there, YOU HAVE TO GO.",
          "The changes made to the park for the holiday season are amazing. Also the new Star Wars themes add a fresh experience at this park. Clean, safe and fun for everyone.",
          "Always 5 stars for Disneyland. This is a place where you can have fun. Based on my experience, Disneyland Anaheim is more fun than in Paris since visitors here are more involved with Disney's vibe. But the queues here are much much shorter \u2026",
          "Excellent theme park! I saved up for about a year and was able to get enough money to get two annual passes, and it was really worth it. The park is a bit pricey, but it\u2019s very worth it. I saw a review that said that it\u2019s only for children, \u2026",
          "Good fun day, lines weren't long for rides. Food was pretty terrible!!! The only thing I'd recommend eating was the cauliflower burger in the beauty and the beast dining area in the kids area. It was outstanding and came with a side of \u2026",
          "Annual Pass holder here. If you plan your day beforehand and get maxpass you'll have a great day (even if it's super busy). Always changing up the food offerings is fun to check out.",
          "This place brings back so many memories from my childhood and it never gets old. I always enjoy every time I go but because of how much admission costs it's nowhere often as I used to go & would like to go. It's because of the high cost I only have it 4 stars.",
          "I had called multiple times and had talked to multiple people to see what exactly we would need to show proof for being a veteran and everyone gave me the same answer just needed a retired ID from the VA.. Well we got that and when we went \u2026",
          "Loved Galaxy's Edge at night.  Very cool.  The only thing is that the character Chewbacca was rather rude.  We tried 3 times to get a pic with him and he ignored us but was more than kind to others to take pics. My nephew is in a wheelchair and Chewy is his favorite or was but he really disappointed him.",
          "Amazing rides, nice food, just long lines. Not too bad if you go in the evening though. Hope you guys like this place as much as I do!!! \ud83d\ude01",

          "Always a good time.  Galaxy\u2019s Edge was a great addition and my wife and I can\u2019t wait for our next visit.  Holiday decor everywhere was a great touch and definitely got our holiday spirit up!",
          "Got to enjoy Disneyland on the first weekend in January. Despite reports of heavy crowds, our family did not run into any issues with lines, shows or food ordering. However, if you're going to do Disney, the max pass is the only way.",
          "Loved the services that they have for the disabled. My husband and family had a blast. All personnel were great.",
          "It's a beautiful place for children and adults \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Truly my happy place. Cant wait for you to open again!!",
          "Too expensive!! If a family of 4 wants to go they will be paying $600 just to get in the park. That is not what Walt Disney himself wanted. It wanted everyone to share in the dream. It's not worth it if it's going to make you broke!!",
          "I I\u2019m going to be honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting that the park could hold the immense hype the goes with it\u2019s name, specially the californian cousin of the humongous Disney parks and resorts in Florida. It\u2019s too much. Nothing could be this \u2026",
          "Ah... yeah. It is the Happiest Place on Earth. Walt is a genius. The improvements they ate starting to make area fantastic. Star Wars land is open and you can never go wrong with the Pirates of The Caribbean.",
          "Lots of fun rides and friendly cast members, especially the woman at the ticket booth. It's Disney so of course the theming was great. It was really crowded even during the off-season. Most of the rides had an hour long wait. I guess that's \u2026",
          "Always an amazing time, great food, fun rides, and a million things to see! LOVE the silhouette artist on Main Street - a hidden gem! Banyan Beef at Bengal BBQ is a must try!",
          "Biggest waste of money ever the park was not that packed still took hours to get through rides, fast pass never worked and there really was no need to see both parks. We  arrived at 10am and left at 11pm and only got to ride 4 rides and eat \u2026",
          "Went when they just switched to Christmas. I'm a foodie and love their Mickey macaroons. Tried the Mickey gingerbread cookie and fell in love again so I bought 5 more so I could take some home. Learn to use the fast passes and your time there will be well spent!",
          "Almost every year I visit Disneyland and every time I was feeling this place is really the happiness place in the world. But, last visit was a couple weeks-ago I was feeling like I am at the Walmart!! The employees was weird and not smiling \u2026",
          "It's Disney. Watching how it is evolving for a whole new group of people is truly a joy. Lots of tradition but with additions of Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars attractions it truly is amazing to see Disney embrace future generations.",
          "The park is great. We've been to the one in Florida twice and didn't think we would like it as much. However, maybe Disney should reconsider their whole boarding pass idea. Instead of enjoying the park, we were constantly looking to see if \u2026",
          "It's the Happiest Place on Earth. Such a great place. Can be very busy. We did 3 days in Disneyland and 1 day in California and only just did everything.",
          "It\u2019s the happiest place on earth. Make your dreams come true. I mean what else is to say.",
          "Great sunny day, staff made my sisters day great! Said happy bday and sang to her. Great day Wednesday not many people!",
          "It's the Happiest Place On Earth! What's not to love!",
          "My family loves Disney and going to Disneyland on a rainy Christmas Day was awesome. The Disneyland app has been updated and works great. We purchased the fast pass and was happy we did because we got to go on our most favorite rides \u2026",
          "Always fun. The new Star Wars area is incredible.  Rise of the Resistance is the best ride.",
          "The most magical place on Earth. Pro tip: if using ride share to get to the park. Set drop off for Disneyland Hotel. Super quick walk into downtown Disney and then into either park.",
          "I recently went to Disneyland with my family. And it was SO fun! I rode the rides I got to see the new star wars land. I had such a great time I really hope to go back sooner. But you have to be careful cause there is a lot of people there. Have a great day!",
          "SO MUCH FUN! Really a unforgettable experience. I do think this side of the park as lots more rides to choose from than California Adventure, but California adventure will soon get Avengers Campus so that will make up for that. \n\nAs for the \u2026",
          "Very few people this time of year and yet Disneyland was still in full swing we're actually able to get a table in the little clam chowder stand next to Pirates of the Caribbean. The kids had a great time cuz we were able to get on some of the rides that usually have really long lines",
          "What was once a fantastically fun theme park is now overpriced and overcrowded. Went on thu 2/27/20 thinking it wouldn't be crowded this time of year on a weekday. Wow were we wrong. The new star wars experience forces too many people to \u2026",
          "Whats not to love? Disneyland is amazing always changing advancing. This place definitely brings magic to kids and adults everywhere!",
          "So much fun to see everything that has changed over the last decade. Galaxy's Edge is beautiful and masterfully put together.",
          "One of the best places ever I had gone. \nYou should try at least three days pass. \nIt impossible to try all games in one day. \nDifferent types of games is here suitable for all your family members \ud83d\ude0e\nDifferent food cuisines available also. \u2026",
          "Love Disneyland although I wish the strollers were a little bit bigger my 4 year old has a hard time taking a nap he has to hunch up so much he was actually trying to lean back. But it's so much fun",
          "Cast members were helpful. You see lots of characters and they interact with you . They dont seemed rushed. Would have given 5 stars but the fireworks were canceled and the snow show was a flop. Kids were disappointed.",
          "What can you say about Disneyland? It's a beautiful place, it's majestic and wonderful, it's the place that everyone wants to visit. I stayed in it for almost eleven hours and I enjoyed every minute of it. They say that this is the place where all dreams come true... It is indeed. I recommend to visit it, you will not regret it.",
          "First time seeing the park decorated for Halloween and loved it. This park appears to be kept quite clean. The cast members were friendly and helpful. Awesome rides and loved all the detail put into the park. It was a magical experience!"

        "wiki": "Downtown Disney (officially the Downtown Disney District) is an outdoor shopping center located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It opened on January 12, 2001; a component of the Disneyland Resort expansion project alongside the Disney California Adventure theme park and Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. \n\n\n== Location and history ==\nDowntown Disney connects the two Disneyland Resort theme parks with its three resort hotels, running from the western side of the property's Esplanade to the Disneyland Hotel. West Street, which bordered Disneyland's western side, was rechristened Disneyland Drive and lowered to accommodate a pedestrian bridge that connects much of Downtown Disney to the Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. A Disneyland Monorail System station sits adjacent to the pedestrian bridge.The area has featured several shops and restaurants, ranging from popular retail brands to many Disney-operated shops including a World of Disney store running beneath much of the Grand California Hotel.Downtown Disney has featured as many as 30 shops, but there have been changes due to recent announcements. In July 2019, parking for Downtown Disney was relocated to south of the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel (Simba parking lot). In addition, a pedestrian bridge linking the Pixar Pals and Mickey and Friends parking structures to the shopping district was opened on September 13, 2019.In 2020, after refurbishment, Jamba opened it doors with new design, which to make better reflect the full offerings available.\n\n\n=== Canceled Fourth Hotel ===\nIn 2017, plans were announced for a fourth resort hotel at the property. Situated in front of the Disneyland Hotel, the new hotel would displace much of the westernmost portion of Downtown Disney and would have featured 700 rooms. The cost of construction for the hotel would have been offset by up to $267 million in tax rebates over 20 years, allowing the resort to keep a percentage of the transient occupancy tax levied on Anaheim hotels.In Summer of 2018, several large Downtown Disney tenants closed in preparation for the new hotel's construction - an AMC Theatres cinema, Rainforest Cafe and ESPN Zone restaurants, and smaller tenants including Earl of Sandwich and a Starbucks location.Weeks after the closures took place, growing tensions between Disney and the City of Anaheim over the subsidy and the hotel's location led to the project being put on hold. Days after the announcement that the project was postponed, Disneyland requested that the tax subsidies be rescinded. The Anaheim City Council voted to rescind the tax subsidies days later.After weeks of inactivity at the hotel's proposed site, Disney announced in October 2018 that the fourth hotel project had been canceled.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "There were some fun souvenir shops, unique brand shops, and several restaurants here. The restaurants had long waits and were pretty pricey, but I think the food is a bit better here than at the parks. We spent about 4 hours here and left very full!",
          "I guess if you do not go to Disneyland, you could soak up some atmosphere of it at Downtown Disney. The food is good and you can buy some of the same items as Disneyland. Get your car park stamped. Otherwise very expensive.",
          "Talk about an amazing Lego store and Disney Store, a few great restaurant options and lots of different types of entertainment",
          "Downtown was really nice and quiet and gave us a break from the park. We ate here and walked around checking out the shops and various desserts outlets. Really nice place ri escape the house and eat at more upmarket places. Highly recommend Ballast for vegans.",

          "Downtown Disney is always a fun place to be but even more so during the holidays. Be prepared to wait for restaurants. There are fun stores and great places to get food/dessert. Shop at the biggest Disney Store.",
          "This place use to be the BUZZ of Disney. We've been here many times over the last 7 years and this time was the most disappointing. The new trees they have put in place are fluorescent but look reasonably artificial. The far end of the street everything has been closed",
          "Surprisingly fun night with the family at Downtown Disney. Convenient parking that all stores will validate so it is free parking. Great vibe walking through the \"village\" with families all with smiles on their faces. Very clean and well-maintained grounds. Various shopping",

          "Downtown Disney is amazing and has lot going on. Once we discovered how much there was to do, we planned our trips to Disneyland around it. The first day we arrive early, check into the hotel and drop off bags, and head to Downtown Disney. The Lego store got the ramps back",
          "Our favorite place in downtown Disney was the big Disney store. Now it\u2019s all boutique Disney like Disney Home and stuff like that. We usually eat at Ralph Brennans and love thier beignets. It\u2019s sad that you have to go through security just to shop there. Be prepared to pay for",
          "We enjoyed walking around, shopping and having dinner at Downtown Disney. We were able to walk from our hotel, and there is a pick up/drop off area for ride shares. It\u2019s beautiful at night! World of Disney is a HUGE shop with all things Disney. The LEGO store has most impressive",
          "Many of the stores carry the same items inside the parks, bit you don't have to have a ticket to get in. There were a few restaurants and snack food kiosks as well to visit in between shopping. Be aware that just like the parks, your bags will be searched and you pass through",
          "You have to pay 30.00 for 3 hours of parking, or 50.00 for the whole day, unless you validate your parking ticket by buying > 25.00 worth of gifts or dinner, in which case you can park for free. disney store is nice, restaurants have to be booked several weeks in advance and if",

          "Of course this downtown Disney location can\u2019t compare to Disney Springs in Florida but there\u2019s a decent selection of restaurants and shopping and of course you can\u2019t beat world of Disney. Just try to avoid peak hours or the place is a zoo",
          "There is a very good selection of restaurants and things to do. Most evenings there are live bands performing. Starting right after Halloween they play Christmas music, which gets a little annoying.",

          "I wasn\u2019t impressed with this place... just a lot of shops, food places,... kind of like a very expensive outlet mall! We only stayed an hour... walking around looking and then left. It is easy to get in and the parking is free and easy exit. Feels very safe too.",

          "Visiting with my family, and we had an amazing time! The California Churro company had different flavored Churros that were sooooo good!! The shopping, the live music, the food at the Jazz Kitchen! Even if you don't have time to visit the parks, take a couple hours and check out",
          "I like the new restaurant options for Downtown Disney! More selections means less waiting for food when you are hungry from a long day at the park. Literally, still lots of space for more (where the previous Rainforest Cafe, ESPN zone and movie theaters used to be). Hoping",
          "Plenty to see and do and eat, lots of Disney shopping for those things you missed in the park . A very busy place to be so get in early to eat !",

          "This is not an amusement park. It is not intended to be an amusement park. Please concider what this area is built for. It is built to allow the general public the ability to shop, eat, and be a part of the general Disney experience without entering the parks. It also allows",
          "Downtown Disney offers a variety of food and drink offerings, and shopping. There is an outdoor bar in the middle atrium, and stage for a nightly band near the Disney Hotel and Downtown Disney parking entrance. Otherwise, it was just a pathway for us to get to the parks.",
          "Security at the start of this area is tight which is reassuring. The staff were pretty grumpy. We didn\u2019t have a bag to search so we started to walk towards the walk through metal detectors - we were shouted at by a grumpy old security guard who said \u2018GET IN LINE!\u2019 We explained",
          "Disney was good for me. (A 21 yr old Disney lover) the park is a good experience especially for little kids, lots of good rides for that age (not so much older or if you want a thrill on the rides, if you wanted crazier rides go to California adventure) but it\u2019s still awesome to",
          "My family was really impressed with Downtown Disney. Lots of restaurants, but I would highly recommend making reservation in advance as the wait times are really long.",
          "All the rides were shutting down left and right the whole day we were at the park. It made for an unpleasant and aggravating experience.",
          "Great food! All the shopping you could need. Desserts galore. Our favorite was the macaroon cart! We will come back!",
          "nice place to spend some time, be aware food and drinks are not cheap, probably the most expensive beer i have ever had.",
          "This collection of overpriced shops is the ultimate tourist trap. I love Disney but this is a nonstarter avoid and go directly w the park.",
          "Other than the main Disney store, there aren't very many other shopping options. The area is like a huge food court with many different eating places. But prices are extremely high...probably double that of similar restaurants away from the resort.",
          "Many options for meals for the whole family. There is a great atmosphere as well and usually quite a bit of music playing in different sections. There are also plenty of shops to unload those \u201ctourist dollars\u201d",

          "It was a very crowded place. It seemed like I have to spend more than an hour for a 5-minute fun. Hot weather calls for more cool water but they are way more expensive than outside.",

          "Downtown Disney is a great place to visit after visiting Disneyland and California Disney. if you have forgotten to buy something in the theme parks, you can find it the the Disney store located here, as well as, Legoland. There are other shops like Sugarboo and co which is a",

          "If you want the store you need to hit them early when it's dead. The painters are also awesome. We got the one with disney characters of our last name. Our favorite thing from the trip.",
          "This is a short strip Of retail shops and restaurants designed to strip you of money. But if you are super into Disney you might like it. Good people watching. There is a small pizza place next to he Naples restaurant that has divine pizza but you have to fight for tables.",
          "I really like downtown Disney. You'll find something to eat for sure and to Shop. The Disney store has everything they sell inside, so dont waste time at the Parks in the shops go afterwards",

          "I just paid $49 for my $27 meal at a Mexican restaurant in Downtown Disney. I stopped at a Pin Trader store first. Then the restaurant. Wait for it .... If the restaurant had validated FIRST I would've gotten 5 hours free. Instead, Pin trader validated first and I had to pay",

          "We are used to Disney Springs in Florida, this was a change. Seems to be more food business, than retail business. Tons of places to eat & drink. Only a few Disney-themed retail shops and not that many people carrying Disney bags (seems the opposite from FL).",
          "There is something to do in Downtown Disney for everyone. If you are willing to spend money there is Starbucks, bowling, a new Pop-Up Disney Store, the Void Star Wars Secrets of the Empire, upscale dining and shops. There is quite a bit of free entertainment nightly and lush",

          "Splitsville was a family favorite for us at DTD. We are a family who enjoy bowling and were pleasantly surprised by the excellent culinary experience we enjoyed there as well. There are several new choices for dining available that we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to try this trip",
          "Of course Disney Land is quite a magical place. We loved it. But couldnt get over the crowds, kind of spoilt the experience and we chose not to go back for a second day. Two of the events we wanted to go to were closed, Space Mountain, mechanical problem and Pirates of the",

          "Loads of restaurants, shopping and cool things to see. We picked up a few last minute trinkets at the Disney store. My young daughter loved building a race car and winning her race out front of the LEGO Store.",
          "There is a great variety of restaurants here, but I expected there to be more shops available/more variety in the merchandise.",
          "Shop, grad a meal, or a drink, and people watch. A simple walk dropping into the different shops. A great place to just hang out.",
          "The best place regardless of your age, you will always have a good time. excellent staff all very friendly. the only bad thing is the price, from the pass tickets. Everything inside is very expensive, if you want food you have to take your own or wait to leave. but from there on",
          "Some great restaurants and bars here. Less busy than Disneyland and California Adventure. Churros in a variety of flavours. Blue ribbon corn dogs are delish! Biggest variety of Disney paraphanelia for sale here. We escaped here daily.",

          "This is a great option that is not apart of the park \u2013 so free to enter and look around. There are great options to sit and dine. There is also food vendors, so don\u2019t need to sit inside a restaurant. Less crowed and more relaxed than inside the parks, also better menu",
          "Mostly made up of restaurants and a few shops. Was able to walk full length while waiting for dinner reservations (Sat evening most places had 45+ min wait)",
          "My partner enjoyed looking down Downtown Disney during our trip as there were a lot of shops and restaurants to choose from and most importantly we found Sprinkles who sell the best Cupcakes ever. We\u2019d highly recommend he Bananna, Strawberry and Lemon Coconut cupcakes.",

          "This is not as big as the one in FL but has everything you need. Great restaurants to choose from, shopping, and proximity to the parks for fireworks. We loved the Ballast Point Brewery for dinner.",
          "We recently stayed at the DLR during spring break. We wanted to take advantage of the early morning entrance but needed a quick coffee and nosh before hand. There are very few options before 8am but the Starbucks and La Brea bakery offer some nice breakfast sandwiches to go.",
          "A Disneyland Vaca, also means at least one afternoon and evening stroll in Downtown Disney. I LOVE DTD! Yes...you will need to go through a security check point as you enter, AND as with ALMOST everything in life, there is a price for your time here (parking fee OR purchase).",

          "This was our first trip. It was good for a walk around but is small so is a little unpleasant for walking when it is crowded. World of Disney is a huge store and there are a lot of options for food. There was some live music when we were there. It's worth a visit.",
          "This is the place to go for last chance to get souvenirs. Still high priced. Lines were long for the food and was not that great. Paying for parking but can pay less if u buy something and get the ticket validated.",
          "If you arrive late at night then it is worth checking out Downtown Disney in order to get you pumped for Disneyland the next day! It is open until 1am. However, everything is super expensive (as to be expected )",
          "Wow, could not believe this area was absolutely nothing. If you've ever been to DTD in Orlando, do not waste your time here. Only reason we went was we had extra time between checking out of our hotel and getting to the airport. Parking is very expensive unless you spend at",
          "Great place to shop without paying the money to go into Disneyland. Also great food places. Great night time action without going into the park.",
          "For new visitors, Downtown Disney is located walking distance right between Disneyland and California Adventure. There is no fee. I believe its open from around 9 am to 11 pm. It's fun to stroll that area. There are loads of restaurants, bakeries, souvenir shops, movie",

          "It offers a nice variety of restaurants and stores, but everything is a lot more expensive than in the same brand at a different location. I consider that if you are smart, just take a nice walk and then go to another fashion mall to spend your money!",

          "Recent closure of AMC 12 was a disappointment. Live music was good; Disney-Cruise ship quality. Food and beverage options, while good, were overpriced. Worth an evening visit but not the next evening options for Anaheim.",

          "Overall the places at downtown Disney are great! The retail franchise stores are the same as elsewhere, the Disney World store is great, the Naples Ristorante e Pizzeria is divine and delicious and one of my favs. The Ralph Brennan\u2019s Jazz Kitchen is fun to visit but just \"okay\"",
          "Stopped here and had an inexpensive dinner in one of the restaurants. Had a good time wandering around with my sister-in-law and her husband. A number of great places to see here just for a quick evening either when in the area or spending a day at Disney.",
          "I love all that Downtown Disney has to offer and the souvenir store there really is the best that you'll come across when you're shopping at Disney. And the best part is that you can go after the park closes and not carry around souvenirs all day.",
          "We have been to Disney Land and Disney world many times. Each time the cast members seem to be losing their charmcompared with the last. The California parks are worse than Florida. Why? Don't know but it's fixable. When I celebrated my last birthday in Disney world, almost",
          "Lots of shops and restaurants. Of course there is a Disney store which is huge. Don't miss the Lego store! Parking can be expensive, but if you buy or eat there, you can get a validation. Nice place to people watch and relax a bit without going into the Park.",
          "It was raining, so that most of the stores were very crowded. I don't know how crowded they would have been if people weren't going in just to get out of the rain. The outdoor seating restaurants were closed. Overall, the area was clean, the store staff were pleasant.",
          "Downtown Disney is a fun place to shop, it\u2019s overpriced (as expected) but there is still quite a bit of places under renovation. If you plan on coming here to eat, make a reservation. If you go during meal times, expect a long wait. The LEGO store is always a fun place to visit!",
          "Nice place to stroll and do some shopping or even having a small or big lunch. The disney shop is huge with a lot of choices so interesting especially for the childeren. If you have an entry ticket you can take the monorail to enter disneyland immediately.",
          "Our family is from Canada and we come to California at least once a year, usually in the summer. This is the first year we came during off season. One of the first things we noticed was the changes that have occurred. There is no ESPN or the Rainforest Cafe. Both are gone.",

          "Really nice place to shop and eat and wonder around to finish your amazing day at the parc ! Huge shops, loved it",
          "Worth a visit to look through the mega Disney store (rather than search for what you want in the parks) and to grab a bite to eat after a long day in the parks. Book ahead though (using the Disney app) if you don\u2019t want to wait ages to be seated. The half meter pizza at Naples",
          "We visited early November shortly after multiple locations had been closed and after the new hotel build had been put on hold. We loved our meal at Earl of Sandwich as well as visiting Sephora. However the security staff were very rude to my husband. Would be nice to visit again",
          "When you're children and grandchildren log 75 miles in the 6 days we spent at Disneyland/California Adventure Park and we logged 50 miles, you know we spent some great shopping and eating time in Downtown Disney. When your feet hurt, the best stop is Starbucks in Downtown",
          "Its all about .. shopping and eating ... We visited on New Years Eve, early afternoon, that day there was added entertainment in the courtyard and food trucks. Interesting concept, i.e the ability to get the disneyland experience without entering the park, though there is a",
          "Downtown Disney is nice in that it gives you a taste of the Disneyland park experience with no admission fee. If you eat dinner there, they will validate parking. For kids, the lego store is fun, and there are little stands and small activities. All the stores are expensive.",
          "A row of shops that leads to the Disney parks. It has restaurants, bars, Disney outlets, coffee shops etc. A nice row of outlets that you could see anywhere really the only difference being that they're adjacent to the Disney Parks, cheers. :-)",
          "Ever since they have placed the metal detectors at each entrance of the shopping n entertainment areas, I have been down there at least 8-10xs and more than half they only select a random group to go thru them when the line to go in gets too long. This defeats the whole",
          "Had a very nice afternoon and evening at Downtown Disney. Lots of nice shops to browse in and places to get a bite to eat.",
          "Found a magnificent Italian restaurant for lunch that we enjoyed so much we went back for dinner the same day.",
          "Fun place to take a break or end your park day. Cute shops, a giant Disney shop, restaurant options.",
          "Was looking forward to ESPN Zone, but found out they and Rainforest Cafe and the movie theater are gone because there was going to be a new hotel, that didn't come. Did go to the Creaole Cafe t o get their famous beignets, which didn't disappoint! The most fun to be had there is",
          "Many shops and restaurants available. That being said very pricey. A corn dog for $8.50. That price was typical. Better price off site.",
          "A good number of shops and eateries, but I was kind of shocked at how small it is in comparison with Downtown Disney Orlando",
          "We only walked through here going to and from The Disneyland Hotel for a character dining meal, but what we saw was fun. There were lots of places to do pin trading with cast members, so that was nice! There was live entertainment of many varieties (singing, dancing, magic...)",
          "Not Florida. It's small and you can walk it in about 40mins. But stopping in all the shops you'll be there for a while. It was the perfect size for us. And of course it's always good when food is all around. Next time we will have time to do the 2 parks.",
          "We didn't know what to expect when we brought out 2 year old to Downtown Disney, other than she lives Disney and we cannot do much wrong. We did expect a little more Disney, and less dining and shopping establishments, but the establishments that are there are great. Of course",
          "Starbucks opens at 7am so you can have a little relax before the long day starts. In general the precinct is very enjoyable with lots of eateries and a giant Disney merchandise store. I really enjoyed my time just wandering along.",
          "We went to Downtown Disney to do some shopping but found out when we got there that half of the place was closed down. I have been to Downtown Disney in Florida and love it. So I was hopping to get the same experience in California. Boy was I wrong. Waste of time, go enjoy",
          "We went here everyday during our trip. The pizza restaurant was great and the restaurant above the bowling alley was amazing! Sorry I can\u2019t rememeber the name but I had the poke bowl 3 times. The shopping is great and make sure you walk all the way to the end and go to Earl Of",
          "You have to eat at the Earl of Sandwich at the entrance to the Downtown Area. The Disney store here is huge and perfect for grabbing souvenirs either before or after the parks.",
          "Walk along the Main Street. Admire the shops and characters. Watch out for the trims and many amusements along the street. Lots of place to eat and dine. Heaps of shops. It is expensive, so keep that in mind before you come here.",
          "Not much going on here. We were a bit disappointed, but its Disney we still had some fun. We liked how all parks and downtown are within walking distance.",
          "A variety of shopping and dining. Very convenient if you are staying in the Disneyland area. Restaurants are OK.",
          "I'm not overly impressed with Downtown Disney. It has a variety of shops, restaurants and kiosks. It seemed clean, and it was nice to walk to when we were entering the parks, but it wasn't a big deal.",
          "So again if you have been to the Florida this is a lot smaller. There weren\u2019t any great places to eat. I guess I just expected more choices after going to Florida. It definitely seemed more crowded than Florida.",
          "As always, when we are in this area, we visit Downtown for a bit of Disney atmosphere. So a few evenings ago we arrived there to see the Christmas decorations before they were taken down by Twelfth Night. Well we were disappointed. The place is being reformatted with many of",
          "You can see the fireworks in the park from here. The restaurants are popular and a little pricey. It is an enjoyable way to spend an evening.",
          "Although most of Disneyland is VERY EXPENSIVE to visit, you can visit Downtown Disney for FREE! Admittedly the prices are high here, but you don\u2019t have to buy...",
          "The area has several stores and restaurants. After a day of parks it is a great place to chill, dine and shop. It has a very vibrant nightlife.",
          "We wanted to start our Disney experience but didn't have time to visit a park, so we spent time at Downtown Disney and had dinner here. It is a great addition and ties the parks together.",
          "Fun to wonder through and mostly window shop! Some cool stores. Some expensive stores!! Seems to be missing some bigger restaurants. Not much selection to eat there anymore.",
          "Great Starbucks but otherwise just okay/-unless you live Legos! Then there is something great to do indeed!!",
          "Has some very cool shops. Fine restaurants plus something for everyone to shop for. Would like to see something similar to the ESPN fun zone in the future.",
          "Didn't spend much time here as there was a bit of construction going on and a few places that were closed down. The Disney Store and Lego shop are both fantastic!",
          "My family of four visited Downtown Disney on evening of December 27 with a larger party of 12 \u2013 everyone had a great time, but after the $140 experience at The Void we felt scammed by their photo sales and their failure to correctly validate our parking. We were told the photo",
          "If you want bigger go to Orlando instead. The plus here is to get \"Disneyland gear\" which we did. Disney themed restaurants would be a great addition in the future.",
          "Downtown Disney is the gated area before you enter either of the parks. You have to go through security and metal detector checks before you can enter this area. It is filled with restaurants, shops, entertainment and everything Disney! Most places you are paying tourist",
          "Tons of restaurants for every palate. Plenty of shops also. Located just west of the 2 theme parks so it\u2019s easy to reach. Splitsville is a blast and we always bowl and have lunch there.",
          "Rainforest Cafe needed back. Took it out but then did not replace it with anything! If a Hotel IS eventuallly built, please put in a budget friendly family size room option with at least 4 queen beds in a room for FAMILIES!",
          "It\u2019s really Fun, they took out Build-A-Bear, but, now they have, a Virtual Reality studio, bowling alley, Starbucks, LEGO store, and ESPN center.",
          "The VOID is sooo much fun! Great VR experience! Delicious food at LaBrea. Disney Home Store was cool! Got lots of Christmas presents!",
          "Always awesome and fun and it wasn\u2019t too packed on the 17th or 18th of Dec. the weather was perfect as well!",
          "Filled with souvenir stores and restaurants. The food was far from excellent at the restaurant I tried and rather expensive at that, but if you tired of being in either of the two parks this is a good place to stroll around and soak in the Disney atmosphere.",
          "We had an extra evening and enjoyed walking around, shopping, listening to the entertainment, and eating here! It was relaxing, even though it was super busy time!",
          "The shopping is amazing the restaurants are always the best the Christmas decorations incredible! And close to the grand Californian hotel!",
          "Our family loves Downtown Disney! There are three eating places well worth their value. Naples is not to be missed for a nice sit down dinner (reservations are recommended)! The beignets for breakfast at Jazz Kitchen Express are made with mix from New Orlean's famous Cafe du",
          "We love spending free time in downtown Disney! All the stores are great! Lots to see, give yourself a couple hours!",
          "Absolutely overpriced food, drinks, and merchandise. I guess it\u2019s is normal prices for Disney, but you will absolutely spend too much for things that are not worth it.",
          "Outdoor shopping/dining plaza next to Disneyland, with access to the Grand Californian Hotel. It's super pretty right now (mid December) with all of the Christmas decor - big tree, colorful ornaments, etc. But, parking is not cheap. It's $12 an hour, charged at 30 minute",
          "You can get parking validated if you eat at a sit down restaurant. Wish we would have known that! It\u2019s fun to look at the stores and there was some entertainment such as singers and bands.",
          "Not as many stores as they have in the Florida downtown disney. Expect to pay high prices as not much on sale. Worth a visit to walk through and go to the lego store. The highlight is definitely the Beignets! They melt in your mouth and are inexpensive.",
          "Food was horrible and expensive so pack a lunch or snack. Spent 20 minutes trying to find an employee in order to pay fee for mini golf. Outdated and could use some TLC. Some of the Arcade games were broken. My 5 year old was not impressed and wanted to leave after one round of",
          "Great variety of eating and shopping places.Visit on those days you have spare time but not enough to use your Park pass, or want to do some last minute shopping before going home. Over flow of atmosphere from Disneyland Park.",
          "Never make a trip without adding a little dining in Downtown Disney ... our go to restaurants are Tortilla Jo's and Naples. Who can say no to a 1/2 meter of pizza!",
          "Downtown Disney is a great place to get around the Disney aura if you aren't yet doing the park. But one major issue that I wish they would not have taken away is the movie theater. My kids have loved going to the AMC at Downtown Disney for years to see a Disney movie while we",
          "plenty of nightlife here ate at mexican resturant cant remember the name but food was outstanding service great staff great even sat with us after the meal to talk about aussi very big but best to book ahead two floors and both were packed at 7pm the shopping here is great for",
          "Some of the same shops that are in every mall ( Sephora ), and the selection of restaurants left a lot to be desired. Only 2 stores really were Disney stores and they were busy enough, but I found many items from on-line Disney sites actually cheaper. Toon Town in Florida was",
          "This is a great addition to Disneyland! There are lots of dining choices and plenty of interesting shops to buy just about anything you may wish to buy for others or a remembrance for yourself of the great time you had!",
          "Stayed at Disney's Grand California Hotel for several days and so Downtown Disney was a morning, noon and night affair with us. So much do eat, shop, and drink here that I love NOT having to go outside the area for food or drink, and shopping stuff!",
          "Many changes and vacant locations world of Disney is remodeled Earl of Sandwich is back (GREAT) CHEAPER FOOD THEN IN THE PARKS AND GOOD QUALITY",
          "Took our grandchildren to the World of Disney store. What a great place. Then we went to dinner, how great having all of this in one place. The live performance music had our young grandchildren hoping and dancing with the music. Can't miss with Downtown Disney.",
          "This place used to b brilliant, but now everything has gone, build a ride, build a bear, espn sports, cinema Its very disappointing. The whole Disney thing is starting to just be about money and not the fun it used to be",
          "excellent service (by Jess) and great food - bartender so friendly -well worth a visit moderate prices and no one pushing you to eat and leave",
          "I was in Anaheim on a quick business trip but of course you don\u2019t visit Anaheim without doing something Disney, so we decided on Downtown Disney and boy were we surprised. We went at night around 6pm and it was a fun, friendly, high energy atmosphere. Music, lots of stores, and",
          "I\u2019m really impressed with the variety of restaurants and shops here! Before it was almost all \u201ccheep food and cheaper shops\u201d but with the introduction of a few specialty shops and stores (LOVE Disney HOME and Star Wars VOID) they\u2019ve spruced up what used to feel like an outdated",
          "Stores and restaurants outside of Disneyland. You don't need a ticket to get, but you will go through a security check. There is a big Disney store and several kiosks to get your Disney fix (or last minute shopping). There are several places that were empty or under renovation.",
          "Was nice to be able to walk around and look at stores etc without having to go into the park. Nice food outlets and plenty of stores. Clean and tidy.",
          "The are several shops and restaurants here, and there is no admission to Downtown Disney. There is a legoland store, a few Disney themed stores, Pandora, Sephora, a shoe store, Sprinkles cupcakes, and a confectionery. Smaller than expected though.",

          "There are lots of shops and good restaurants. The Legos store is one of my favorite to visit since they have a great selection and good stock. The kids will love it too. A lot of sights and sounds to keep everybody entertained and excited. reservations are a must at any of the",
          "my husband and I decided to take a stroll through downtown Disney. I was a little disappointed with the store options. Coming from Florida and Disney Village, this was very underwhelming. They did have a few good restaurants. We ate at the New Orleans type restaurant and the",
          "So many things are classed it was a waste of time. Shopping can be done on Main Street Disneyland. A couple of good restaurants are still open.",
          "I had been to Downtown Disney before and had a great time, but the last time I went, many of the shops were either closed indefinitely or closed for remodeling. It was a waste of a day since we dedicated the entire day just for Downtown Disney. The evening is a bit better",
          "Fun to wander our first night at Disney - get the excitement of the parks without an entry fee! Gets us in the mood for the next morning.",
          "Went for a business trip so decided to check it out it\u2019s Disney but seemed overpriced and overcrowded even knowing it was a Disney park food was excellent but the Two hour wait was kinda long not much to do while waiting.",
          "I liked that you had to clear security to enter this area, even though no ticket is required. It helped to maintain the safe feeling Disney atmosphere. We at dinner one evening, lunch another afternoon and did some shopping. We also played the Star Wars VR which we loved. Not a",
          "as with Disney everything is first class and all cast members are friendly and helpful. good way to walk, shop and burn off some of the calories for the extra and excellent food services",

          "There is a lot of updates happening in downtown Disney. New stores being built and things being renovated. I\u2019m sure when it\u2019s all finished it will be amazing!",
          "I loved the theater, earl of Sandwich and especially the rainforest cafe. Sad that only one has returned. I am upset that Disney pulled out of the new hotel development due to lack of a tax break. It is still a fun place for a few hours and to grab a quick lunch.",
          "I was very surprised when I went to DownTown Disney this trip. The Rainforest Cafe is no longer open and the building is sitting vacant. Also, ESPN is also closed, with an empty building.",
          "Loved visiting here at night great choice of places to eat and nice place to look round with interesting shops.",
          "Recommend hitting DtDisney before either park to get a taste of things to come. The music, the smells, the decorations-all up to the Disney brand level.",

          "Many shops, several different types of sit down restaurants, Sprinkles cupcakes, the area has grown over the years!",
          "So if you like crowded overpriced stores, this place is for you. It is just as expensive as the park and they dont have any unique shopping. The reason we go is for The Void. This is a awesome walkthrough virtual reality based on Star Wars. It is about $35 a person, but we loved",
          "I was quite disappointed after visiting this location after visiting the Disney Springs location in Orlando. About 45% of the businesses are under construction. The restrooms are not taken care of and they are small.",

          "Some restaurants and shops and depending on type of day security can be long to get into. If you lived locally you might come, but otherwise just a walk by on the way to the parks",
          "We visited downtown Disney the first evening we arrived in Anaheim. We wanted to walk around and look at the shops and watch some of the entertainment that might be happening. quite a few of the shops/restaurants were closed because Disney was going to build a new hotel. i heard",
          "The Downtown Disneyland area is so much more fun than I'd imagined it would be. There's so many dining, shopping and entertainment choices here that you really could spend the day here. Its a great place to unwind before and after a long day in the park.",
          "Downtown Disney has recently closed some major establishments (ESPN Zone, Rainforest Cafe, AMC Theaters, Wetzel's Pretzels) but there are plans to open a couple more eateries and talks of a new hotel being raised up. In any case, new additions (such as the bowling alley) and",

          "Downtown Disney felt like a long walk particularly at the end of a long day with not that much to offer. We had a mix of kids with us so maybe there is more to offer for adults but I felt that it was boring and wished we could bypass this particularly at the end of a long walk",
          "I love Downtown Disney. It has a nice open walking path with lots of places to stop and rest. They need a lot more restaurant options since losing several with the remodel. They seem to fill up quickly and choices are limited. Salt & Straw had just opened six the crowds were",

          "Having Disney District attached to our hotel, we used it daily to walk through. Once the Reno\u2019s are finished it will be great. Really disappointed that Rain forest cafe has been taken away and ESPN zone. Definitely need more restaurants. World of Disney store and Lego store are",

          "The last time we went to Downtown Disney, it was very enjoyable. The shopping for shirts and other items were very accessible. At that time we ate at The Rain Forest Cafe. It was quite a positive experience. Rumors were that they were closing it down due to renovating that area.",
          "A great place to eat and shop. They had entertainment also at various stands. A variety of different types of food.",
          "It was fun just to hang out and walk around. Not very big place. They had some live entertainment going on while we were there.",
          "Pleasant to stroll with shops, restaurants, and street vendors. There was a fair bit of construction. I'm not sure that it's a respite from the crush of the Disney parks. It still gets quite busy. It's worth a stroll, though.",
          "When visiting the Disneyland Resort, we really enjoy walking through Downtown Disney and looking at the seasonal decorations. The food options are great if you are looking for better food than what is served in the parks, and with lower cost options as well. We enjoy Tortilla",

          "Visited with my daughter and grandson and found this area yo have much better options and prices than inside Disneyland. There was also some excellent live music, which was fun. It\u2019s really a marketplace with Sephora, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, and many other familiar chains. This",

          "This is the place to go when you need somewhat of a break from the two theme parks. There is still a lot of \"Disney\" to be had, but you can also get better food options here and you can order alcoholic beverages -- a nice bonus. The World of Disney store is fantastic: if",

          "Nicely decorated for Fall with Gourds and Pumpkins. Great shops with some exclusive Disney Items and photo ops!!",
          "Small compared to Disney Springs in Orlando but Florida has more room. It's nice that it's right at the entrance to the park so you can walk thru before you head back on the tram if that is how you got there. Went early and some of the shops were not open yet a little",
          "Downtown Disney is apparently undergoing a major facelift and rather than catering to local visitors they want to attract high-end tourists and make way for a new Disney hotel. We are tourists, but not the high-end kind, so we were super disappointed to see that they are making",
          "Downtown Disney to me was very boring. You do not need much time to experience the whole thing. If you get the chance to go to Florida and experience Disney Springs, that place is so large and filled with so much to see and do that you could spend a whole day there.",

          "Reached Anaheim in the afternoon and our visit to Disneyland Park was planned for the next day so Downtown Disney was the ideal option to spend the evening. Basically a fun outdoor shopping and dining location with a few entertainment options it was great to just walk around,",

          "Very disappointed with this. Rushed over there on first late afternoon in Anaheim to go out for dinner with the family. Was not at all what we were expecting and maybe that\u2019s our fault (thinking it would be like City Walk in Universal). It isn\u2019t. Lots of things were shut.",

          "Downtown Disney relies on the Disney name to warrant overcharging for food and merchandise. I got the same Minnie Mouse dolls outside of Downtown for a bargain price. It's the exact identical doll and I saved $8 when bought from an outside store. Think before you buy any Disney",
          "What used to be a fun, free-to-walkabout place to go for Disney feel without Disney prices is being repurposed. It will soon be more ex-clusive to people paying top dollar to be in Orlando West, rather than the original feeling of a Disney vibe without the $100+ per day price",
          "If I want to go to Sephora, etc... I would go to a mall or an outlet. Totally losing its Disneyland charm!!..a complete shame!! and no Rainforest Caf\u00e9 or ESPN Zone. Very disappointed in the changes & sad to see. Glad that atleast the Disney store was still there!!",
          "I got to go a couple of times--once just to eat, once to do some shopping and looking around. Lots of great restaurants to choose from, and lots of great shops!",
          "It is unfortunate that a great place Like Disney Downtown is turning into a ghost town. I am guessing that the rents are out of this world and the tenants can't make a profit. I would think the this corporate giant could make this product work. Very disappointing.",
          "Downtown Disney was a really fun place to people watch and grab dinner. We went in November in the Christmas decorations were already up which we loved. Do you restaurants are a bit on the pricey side but hey you are in Disneyland so what do you expect. There are also a lot of",
          "Downtown Disney is great, once you clear security there are lots of restaurants and snack place plus Disney and Lego shops. The Starbucks gets super busy and we found that in the evening you couldn\u2019t walk up to a restaurant and had to book.",
          "Its a very nice place , although there's a number of restaurants that are closed because of the new Hotel plans in the same place. I like the shops there, specially LEGO shop as well as Disney shop where you can buy a lot of souvenirs. I am sure that in few years this place will",
          "Very happy with Downtown Disney! I love how the shops are open later than Disneyland & California Adventure. You can have fun all day in the parks and then shop and eat till ya drop in Downtown Disney! Sad ESPN Zone is gone though.",
          "I can't say that I was impressed because my overall observation was that everything was extremely overpriced. Yes there are many restaurants and food carts but holy smokes was everything expensive . There were a variety of entertainment option but like the food option, be",
          "We had hoped to have dinner after a long day in Disneyland. We were very disappointed with options for food and shops. Only a few restaurants open, a lot were closed for good or in process of building. Shops were few and far between, too many upscale clothes stores, jewelry or",
          "So obviously this is just a bigger version of the exit part of any ride in the park that drops you into the gift shop before moving on. You exit either park and make your way out, and you are bombarded with the Disney Store that\u2019s two blacks long, and Build a Bears and LEGO and",
          "Theres only one store we shop at at downtown Disney as a family. They have just about everything. We occasionally shop at build a bear and miss the movies !",
          "Great selection of shops and great food you have a variety of choices. Disney store is my favorite love how it\u2019s expamdinh.",
          "This was the first place we went to when we arrived & it got us in the mood for Disneyland the next day. We were disappointed that the Old Fashioned Pooh Bear was sold out in every store. Come on Disney stock up. You should never run out of popular items.",
          "A few friends went to see a show at the House of Blues. It was a great time. The food and drinks were great and we can't wait to go back soon!",
          "Gotta say not for me,half the shops were closed down for refurbishment or just closed in general. Had some food in the Mexican place (can\u2019t even remember name) Please, do yourself a favour a don\u2019t eat in there. Yeah basically not a good experience after having such a good time",
          "I was disappointed by downtown Disney. There were quite a few places closed and it seemed very commercialized. It was a decent place to pick up a gift outside the park but it\u2019s not something I was impressed with. The food was expensive, except for the food trucks, which were",
          "It's nothing like Florida but it's good. The huge downside is the construction. It completely took away from the magic of Disney. Plus the World of Disney store was also under construction making it drastically smaller. It's August, summer season, why is there construction",
          "Worth the trip from wherever you are from. Should at least spend the whole day here to enjoy the attractions in comfortable pace",
          "Compared to Orlando downtown Disney it\u2019s not a patch but the prices certainly are, every shop is ok and offers discounts but the eateries are expensive which is the Disney way!!",
          "I have always had a good experience with Disney but this was unbelievable. We spent all day at Disney the day before, spent a fortune and we went to Downtown Disney next morning around 10:30am to do some Disney shopping. We spent $85.00 at the Disney store and $30 at Starbucks,",
          "if you like anything Disney you be able to buy it here. lots of cool places to eat and drink. open to anyone you don't need a ticket for the park",
          "We were disappointed with Downtown Disney, as it's undergoing what appears to be a large refurbishment...but why close so many places all at once? No comparison to Florida's Disney Springs. The Lego store was excellent to be fair, even the World of Disney was having a big",
          "If you are there at night time note that it is not very well lit. Try not to be anywhere near when the fireworks is over because it is way too crowded, way too fast. Didn't think the shops were anything special, in fact most seemed overpriced.",
          "Maybe this review is a little unfair on Disney as they have announced that a number of places are now closed (ESPN store and Rainforest Cafe amongst others) to make way for a new hotel however we were a little disappointed on our recent visit. Yes there is a Lego store and a",
          "Here is a walkway to Disney. There is security check point, but that\u2019s the last security check point!",
          "Stayed at Disney hotel so had no choice but to walk through this part of park. This is open to the public but everyone goes through pretty thorough security screen. Very upbeat and modern mall. Great stores, Disney and others. Best of all the AC on hot summer days provides",
          "This is a great spot to dine and shop if you want a Disney experience without paying for a ticket or spending a whole day at Disneyland.",
          "There are still a handful of restaurants and stores open but many spots are under construction. Most of the Disney Store is open, the Disney Dress Store and the Lego Store. LaBrea Bakery Cafe, Jamba Juice, and Naples Ristorante & Pizzeria. There are some stalls selling pins and",
          "We frequented Downtown Disney a number of times back in 2015 and found it lively and fun. The same cannot be said for its current iteration three years later. Huge swaths of shops and restaurants are just empty, apparently either being cleared for construction of a new hotel or",
          "There were a few decent places to eat and shop but overall it's average. Some food trucks come after 3:00 pm and there are empty stores and construction which take away from the overall experience.",
          "There are a ton os shops and restaurants that cater to the Disney crowds. Lengthy waits at the food joints and overpriced goods in the retailers. Cheers!",
          "Don't miss a night in Downtown Disney. We loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the vibe. The most important thing is to remember to buy at least a coffee so you can get your parking pass validated - that makes parking free!",
          "had an awsome time so much to see and do hopimg to take my grandson there ,firssttime vistors travelled fromAustralia My 14 yr old sson had a terriffic time",
          "Nice place to grab a snack and shop. The lego store is fun if you have kids, they can buikd something. Stabucks, Jamba Juice. There's a cinema too.",
          "Nothing like The Downtown in Florida or the wonderful Epcot - the restaurants poor and pricy. We ate here twice and then escaped elsewhere. Some areas under renovation, all a bit shoddy realty.",
          "We walked thru Downtown Disney on our way to and from the parks everyday and got to know it well. It\u2019s a very enjoyable, relaxed atmosphere. They have some nice little shops with Disney merchandise as well as specialty type stores. We happened to be at the Taqueria on Taco",
          "Walked around one evening with my family prior to our park day the following day. Browsing in the shops was fun. Not much in the way of other activities, but there is a wide variety of food and restaurants.",
          "Lots of restaurants closed or being built. Not much atmosphere. Not very attractive or inviting. Miss it and go straight to Disney\u2019s California Adventure",
          "It is under construction but still beautiful.. every night live music. So many food options, nice stores extremely clean. Everyone friendly. I love Disney!",
          "Shops galore that the little ones will love. Reasonably priced stores to suit any budget we visited every day after our Disney adventures.",
          "Was surprised that the restaurants at Downtown Disney closed early and that there were just a few restaurants to choose from. We had left Disney California at 10:00 pm when they closed looking for a restaurant. We were expecting a slew of restaurants to choose from at Downtown",
          "The prices at the restaurants, bars, and food carts is a bit steep but that is to be expected with Disney. Overall the experience is magical and no fee to visit Downtown Disney which is nice but there\u2019s security and bag check area you still go through so a very safe and secure",
          "If your are a disney shopper,you gonna fall in love with this place.All the stores open to midnight,you can shop furniture and jewelry here.",
          "Loads of places to eat and shops to keep you occupied in the day and on the night loads of entertainment and places to drink. A very good mix with the link to the two Disney hotels super close so that of your staying at either you can pop down form your room very easily. Also",
          "I love Downtown Disney, but right now too much of it is closed for construction. I\u2019m also not a fan of the renovations done to the World of Disney shop. The renovations made less room for merchandise. I think Downtown Disney will be great again once more of the construction is",
          "Lots of places are closed and boarded up. it was a bit depressing walking through to go to the park every day.",
          "i enjoyed seeing all the items for sale related to Disney and the characters. Worth the time to see it!",
          "Another place that we always enjoy visiting. It\u2019s always enjoyable to hit the Disney store here, and watch the fireworks from the parking lot. I prefer not to shop or dine here too often as everything seems to be much more expensive than these same places at the local mall.",
          "There were some nice shops just not enough places to eat a good dinner. All the \u201cgood\u201d places were booked or had extremely long wait times.",
          "Compared to Disney Springs in Orlando this place is a joke. Very small and not many places to eat. Would not recommend .",
          "I've been in Downtown Disney Orlando and you still feel you are in Disney. This one tho, very few Disney stores, probably 3 and just one (World of Disney) had a good variety of Disney merchandising. We went to another store because we couldn't find what we wanted but we left",
          "Really enjoyed visiting downtown Disney although lot of refurbishment going on. Feel this could have been kept to minimal just to much at one time. Live music great fun and some excellent entertainment.",
          "We walked through the area, back and forth, to the parks for 5 days. Half the places are closed down! Nicely decorated and landscaped but lacking that wow factor for us.",
          "Very busy place at night be early you will get a table . later the night you will have to wait .You can shop to you drop",
          "Downtown Disney has add many unique to Disney stores. The Disney Dress Shop, The Disney Confectioner, The Disney Home Collection. They need to add some more interesting & better restaurants but you can eat at the hotel restaurants if you don't go into the parks.",
          "Used to be, they'd give you 2 hours free parking, and up to 5 hours if you went to eat at one of the restaurants (and showed your receipt). Well, that perk has gone away - I was there for less than 2 hours and was charged $18 to park! NEVER AGAIN. Way to alienate your locals,",
          "A fun experience at Disneyland. Shops and food galore, Stop before you enter the parks.Great for picture taking.",

          "I was in Disneyland in July and noticed that 1/2 of Downtown Disney was gone. I here that they are moving everything out for a new hotel and moving all the businesses over to Anaheim Garden Walk. There are still some restaurants there and a few shops but not like it was.",

        "wiki": "The Anaheim Ducks are a professional ice hockey team based in Anaheim, California. The Ducks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Since their inception, the Ducks have played their home games at the Honda Center.\nThe club was founded in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a name based on the 1992 film The Mighty Ducks. Disney sold the franchise in 2005 to Henry and Susan Samueli, who along with then-general manager Brian Burke, changed the name of the team to the Anaheim Ducks before the 2006\u201307 season. The Ducks have qualified to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs 14 times, won six Pacific Division titles (2006\u201307, 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317), two Western Conference championships (2002\u201303 and 2006\u201307), and one Stanley Cup (2006\u201307).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Start of a franchise (1993\u20131996) ===\nThe Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were founded in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company. The franchise was awarded by the NHL in December 1992, along with the rights to a Miami team that would become the Florida Panthers. An entrance fee of $50 million was required, half of which Disney would pay directly to the Los Angeles Kings in order to \"share\" Southern California. On March 1, 1993, at the brand-new Anaheim Arena \u2013 located a short distance east of Disneyland and across the Orange Freeway from Angel Stadium \u2013 the team's name was announced. The team's name was inspired by the 1992 Disney film The Mighty Ducks, about a struggling youth hockey team who, with the help of their new coach, become champions. Philadelphia-arena management specialist Tony Tavares was chosen to be team president, and Jack Ferreira, who previously helped create the San Jose Sharks, became the Ducks' general manager. The Ducks selected Ron Wilson to be the first head coach in team history. The Ducks and the expansion Florida Panthers team filled out their rosters in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft and the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. In the former, a focus on defense led to goaltenders Guy Hebert and Glenn Healy being the first picks, followed by Alexei Kasatonov and Steven King. In the latter, the Ducks selected as the fourth overall pick Paul Kariya, who only began play in 1994 but would turn out to be the face of the franchise for many years. The resulting roster had the lowest payroll of the NHL at only $7.9 million.Led by captain Troy Loney, the Ducks finished the season 33\u201346\u20135, a record-breaking number of wins for an expansion team, which the Florida Panthers also achieved. The Ducks sold out 27 of 41 home games, including the last 25, and filled the Arrowhead Pond to 98.9% of its season capacity. Ducks licensed merchandise shot to number one in sales among NHL clubs, helped by their presence in Disney's theme parks and Disney Stores. The lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 NHL season saw the debut of Paul Kariya, who would play 47 of the team's 48 games that year, scoring 18 goals and 21 assists for 39 points. The Ducks had another respectable season, going 16\u201327\u20135.\n\n\n=== Paul Kariya era (1996\u20132003) ===\nDuring the 1995\u201396 season, Paul Kariya was chosen to play for the Western Conference in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, (January 1996), Kariya was ranked 14th in league scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games, although the Ducks were overall a low-scoring team. Then a mid-season blockbuster deal with the Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise. The Ducks sent Chad Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third-round pick to the Jets in return for Marc Chouinard, a fourth-round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne. Following the trade, Ducks center Steve Rucchin commented, \"Paul [Kariya] had a lot of pressure on him... He single-handedly won some games for us this year... Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just key on Paul.\" These three players formed one of the most potent lines of their time. Although the trade proved to be an important effort in the team, they still finished short of the playoffs, losing the eight spot in the Western Conference to the Winnipeg Jets based on the number of wins.\n\nDuring the 1996\u201397 season, Kariya became team captain following Randy Ladouceur's retirement in the off-season, and led the Ducks to their first post-season appearance after recording the franchise's first winning record of 36\u201333\u201313, good enough for home ice in the first round as the fourth seed against the Phoenix Coyotes. The Ducks trailed 3\u20132 going into Phoenix for Game 6. Kariya scored in overtime to force the franchise's first Game 7, which they won. However, in the second round, they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep. After the season, Ron Wilson was fired after saying he would like to coach the Washington Capitals. Pierre Page succeeded him. The Ducks started out slowly in 1997\u201398, in part because Kariya missed the first 32 games of the season in a contract dispute. He came back in December, but on February 1, he suffered a season-ending concussion when the Chicago Blackhawks' Gary Suter cross-checked him in the face. With Kariya playing only a total of 22 games that season, the Ducks missed the playoffs and fired Page. The Ducks followed that season up by finishing sixth in the Western Conference in 1998\u201399 with new head coach Craig Hartsburg. However, they were swept by Detroit again, this time in the first round.\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Ducks finished with the same number of points as the previous season, but a much more competitive Western Conference had them miss the playoffs by four points behind rival San Jose Sharks. Despite this, the Mighty Ducks scored more goals than the conference champion Dallas Stars. In the following season, 2000\u201301, the Ducks ended up performing worse, as Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne's point production significantly declined from the previous season \u2013 Kariya went from 86 points to 67 points and Selanne went from 85 points to 57 points. Selanne was subsequently dealt to San Jose at the trade deadline for Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields and a second-round draft pick, while head coach Craig Hartsburg was fired during the season. The team ended up with a losing record and last place in the Western Conference that season. Without Selanne, Kariya's numbers continued to drop in the 2001\u201302 season with new coach Bryan Murray. The Mighty Ducks finished in 13th place in the Western Conference.\n\n\n==== Western Conference champions (2002\u20132003) ====\nThe Mighty Ducks did not reach the post-season again until the 2002\u201303 season with head coach Mike Babcock. They entered the playoffs in seventh place with a 40\u201327\u20139\u20136 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the defending Stanley Cup champions. They shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game 1 turned out to be the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with Petr Sykora scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. The Ducks would finish off the Stars in Game 6 at home. In the team's first trip to the Western Conference Finals, they were matched up against another Cinderella team, the sixth-seeded, three-year-old Minnesota Wild. Jean-Sebastien Giguere strung together three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one total goal in the series in an eventual sweep.\nThe 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, to be played against the New Jersey Devils, had some interesting story lines. Anaheim forward Rob Niedermayer was playing against his brother Scott, while Giguere faced off against fellow French-Canadian goaltender Martin Brodeur. The series began with the home team winning the first five games. In Game 6 at home, Kariya was knocked out from a hit by Devils captain Scott Stevens. However, Kariya would return in the second period and score the fourth goal of the game. In an exciting third period, the Mighty Ducks defeated the Devils 5\u20132 to send the series back to New Jersey for Game 7. Anaheim, however, could not complete their winning streak, as they lost a hard-fought Game 7 to the Devils 3\u20130. For his brilliant play during the post-season, Giguere was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player in NHL history to have won the trophy as a member of the losing team. Giguere posted a 15\u20136 record, 7\u20130 in overtime, with a 1.62 goals against average, a .945 save percentage and a record 168-minute, 27-second shutout streak in overtime.\n\n\n=== Post-Kariya era, Selanne's return and franchise rebrand (2003\u20132007) ===\nAfter the season, Kariya promised to bring the Mighty Ducks back to the Stanley Cup Final the following year. However, Kariya left the Ducks in the summer and joined former teammate Teemu Selanne on the Colorado Avalanche. The 2003\u201304 season was a season to forget, as Jean-Sebastien Giguere could not repeat his stellar goaltending from the previous year. Even with newcomers Sergei Fedorov and Vaclav Prospal, the team finished in 12th place in the standings with a 29\u201335\u201310\u20138 record. Giguere's stats subsequently declined from the previous season, as he only won half the games he did the year before, his goals against average increased from 2.30 to 2.62, his save percentage went down from .914 to .907 and he went from eight shutouts recorded to just three. The team also went from 203 goals to 174.\nDuring the summer of 2004, as the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a long lockout, Disney tried to sell the team but received a low offer of US$40 million, less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, Broadcom Corporation co-founder Henry Samueli of Irvine, California, and his wife Susan bought the Mighty Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75 million. The Samuelis pledged to keep the team in Anaheim. Brian Burke, former Vancouver Canucks general manager and president, was appointed general manager and executive vice-president of the Mighty Ducks on June 20, 2005. In January, Samueli announced the team would be renamed as simply the \"Anaheim Ducks\" as of the following season.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Randy Carlyle was hired as the seventh head coach in team history. Burke was familiar with Carlyle's coaching ability, as the latter had coached the Manitoba Moose from 1996 to 2001 (International Hockey League) and 2004\u201305 (American Hockey League); the Moose had been the Canucks farm club since 2001. Carlyle replaced Mike Babcock, who later signed on to coach Detroit. On August 4, 2005, free agent defenseman Scott Niedermayer signed with the Mighty Ducks to play with his brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost immediately named team captain. On August 22, Teemu Selanne returned to Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006.\nThe 2005\u201306 season also saw the emergence of rookies Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Chris Kunitz (Kunitz also played for the Ducks in 2003\u201304, but immediately returned to the Mighty Ducks' AHL affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks). On November 15, 2005, Anaheim traded Sergei Fedorov and a fifth-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for defenseman Francois Beauchemin and forward Tyler Wright.\nThe Ducks finished the season with a 43\u201327\u201312 record, good enough for 98 points and the sixth seed. The Ducks faced the Calgary Flames in the Western Conference quarter-finals and forced a seventh game in Calgary, shutting-out the Flames to reach the Conference semi-finals. In an interesting playoffs, all the bottom seeds won in the first round, so the Ducks matched-up against the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. Goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov shined as the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games, Bryzgalov breaking Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the franchise's second Western Conference Finals appearance, they faced the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers, a series the Ducks would ultimately lose in five games.\n\n\n==== Stanley Cup champions (2006\u20132007) ====\nPrior to the 2006\u201307 season, the Ducks adopted a completely new look to go along with their new name; their team colors became black, gold and orange, and the logo of a duck-shaped goalie mask was dropped in favor of the word \"Ducks\", with a webbed foot in place of the \"D\".\n\nThe Ducks traded Joffrey Lupul, Ladislav Smid and a first-round draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for star defenseman Chris Pronger. With this trade, solid scoring lines, a shut-down line featuring Rob Niedermayer, Samuel Pahlsson and Travis Moen and an enviable defense, the Ducks were considered by many to be a Stanley Cup favorite. On November 9, 2006, the Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6\u20130 at General Motors Place in Vancouver to improve their season record to 12\u20130\u20134. The win set an NHL open era record by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983\u201384 Edmonton Oilers (the record has since been broken by the Chicago Blackhawks' 21\u20130\u20133 start during the 2012\u201313 season). Anaheim were subsequently shut out by the Flames the following game, 3\u20130, ending their streak. On January 16, 2007, the Ducks played in their franchise's 1,000th regular season game, and on March 11, the Ducks recorded their franchise's 1,000th point with a 4\u20132 win over the Canucks, which improved their franchise all-time record to 423\u2013444\u2013155, with 1,001 points. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48\u201320\u201314 record and 110 points\u2014both franchise records. Although they had three fewer wins than the Nashville Predators, the Ducks won the second seed in the West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title as well as the Predators finishing second in the Central Division behind the Detroit Red Wings (the top seed in the West).\nThe Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild in the Conference quarter-finals in five games and the Canucks in the semi-finals, also in five games. Once again, the Ducks faced the Detroit Red Wings in the franchise's third trip to the Western Conference Finals. In Game 3, Chris Pronger elbowed Tomas Holmstrom and subsequently received a one-game suspension for the illegal check. However, the Ducks won Game 4 without Pronger and Game 5 in Detroit, with Teemu Selanne scoring the latter game's overtime winner. The Ducks then finished off the Red Wings in Game 6 to advance to their second-ever Stanley Cup Final appearance.\n\nIn the Finals, the Ducks won the first two games at home against the Ottawa Senators. However, the Ducks lost Game 3 and Pronger received his second one-game suspension, this time for elbowing Dean McAmmond. The Ducks were again able to win without Pronger, defeating the Senators in Game 4 for an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on home ice in Game 5. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6\u20132 at Honda Center to claim their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Travis Moen was credited with the Cup game-winning goal. Scott Niedermayer, the only player on the team who had previously won a Stanley Cup, was awarded the second Conn Smythe Trophy in Ducks history. The Ducks became the first California team, and the fourth West Coast team since the 1915 Vancouver Millionaires, 1917 Seattle Metropolitans and 1925 Victoria Cougars, to win the Stanley Cup.\n\n\n=== Post-Stanley Cup, Bob Murray replaces Burke (2007\u20132010) ===\nThe Ducks began their title defense in the 2007\u201308 season without two fan favorites, Scott Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne, who were both contemplating retirement. To offset those losses, Burke signed forward Todd Bertuzzi and defenseman Mathieu Schneider. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov on waivers, where he was picked-up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free agent signee Jonas Hiller then became the back-up to starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Both Selanne and Niedermayer would ultimately return and the team finished with a 47\u201327\u20138 record, good enough to earn home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in six games by the Dallas Stars. In the off-season, Burke bought-out the remaining year on Todd Bertuzzi's contract and traded Mathieu Schneider to the Atlanta Thrashers.\n\n \nAfter an extremely slow start to the 2008\u201309 season, on November 12, 2008, Burke resigned to take the same position for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bob Murray replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled to make the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Ryan Whitney; Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for defenseman James Wisniewski; and Travis Moen, who was traded to the San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The trades gave the Ducks new life as a hot streak to end the season launched the team into the playoffs. Jonas Hiller emerged as the new number one goalie during the stretch drive. The Ducks defeated the number one seed and Presidents' Trophy-winning San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference semi-finals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings in seven games. Before the 2009\u201310 season, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the Philadelphia Flyers for Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and two first-round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils, respectively. The Ducks then signed free agent center and former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu to a one-year deal.\nAnother slow start would doom the Ducks. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a contract extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, as well as the acquisitions of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39\u201332\u201311 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman Andy Sutton signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year deal.\n\n\n=== Getzlaf and Perry era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\nThe 2010\u201311 season did not begin well for the Ducks, who would lose their first three games. They maintained a .500 throughout record through the first half of the season, but would find their rhythm and finish 47\u201330\u20135, good for 99 points and fourth place in the Western Conference. Corey Perry and Jonas Hiller represented the Ducks at the All-Star Game, and Corey Perry went on to have a 50-goal, 98-point season, which won him the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy. He became the first-ever Duck to win the Hart, as well as the first Richard winner as a Duck since Teemu Selanne won the award in 1999. However, Hiller was injured at the All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season. Even though the Ducks had a great season led by Perry, Hiller, Selanne, Visnovsky and Getzlaf, they would end up losing in the first round of the 2011 playoffs to the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators.\nBefore the 2011\u201312 season began, the team mourned the loss of former Mighty Duck Ruslan Salei, who died in a plane crash with several other former NHL players of Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. The team wore a black patch with his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started the season with NHL Premiere games in Helsinki and Stockholm. This was the third time in franchise history that they started the regular season with games in Europe. They lost 4\u20131 to the Buffalo Sabres in Helsinki but defeated the New York Rangers 2\u20131 after a shootout in Stockholm. After a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle with former Washington Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau. The rest of the season was mostly forgettable, as the Ducks could not get out of the hole they dug themselves in the first half of the season, and ultimately failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season was shortened to 48 games due to a labor lockout. When play resumed in January 2013 after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed, the Ducks opened the season by sweeping a two-game Canadian road trip with a decisive 7\u20133 victory against the Vancouver Canucks on January 19, followed by a 5\u20134 decision against the Calgary Flames on January 21. Their home opener came on January 25, also against the Canucks, who would prevail 5\u20130. The distinction of the Ducks' longest homestand was split between two five-game stretches from March 18\u201325 and from April 3\u201310. Anaheim's lengthiest road trip was a six-game haul from February 6\u201316. Due to the shortened season and the compacted game scheduling, all games were to be played against the Ducks' own Western Conference opponents, and no games were played against Eastern Conference teams. The Ducks finished the season with a 30\u201312\u20136 record and would win their second Pacific Division title in franchise history. In the Western Conference quarter-finals, they ended up losing to the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in seven games, despite holding a 3\u20132 series lead after Game 5.\nEntering the 2013\u201314 season, the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it was announced that Teemu Selanne would be playing in his final NHL season. In the off-season, star forward Bobby Ryan was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and Ottawa's first-round pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, and the Ducks also signed defenseman Mark Fistric, center Mathieu Perreault and a returning Dustin Penner. Despite a bad start suffering a 6\u20131 mauling at the hands of the Colorado Avalanche, the Ducks followed the opener with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record setting ten consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013. At one point of the season, the Ducks won 18 of 19 games, the longest run of one-loss play in the NHL for 45 years. A 9\u20131 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 15 saw Anaheim establish a 20\u20130\u20132 record at the Honda Center, which matched the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years, as well as setting a franchise-record for goals scored in a game (9), and powerplay goals scored in a game (6). Dustin Penner was eventually traded to the Washington Capitals, and prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Ducks acquired veteran defenseman Stephane Robidas from the Dallas Stars. Behind a Hart Trophy-caliber season from club captain Ryan Getzlaf, solid depth scoring, a steady if unspectacular defence and solid goaltending in the form of Jonas Hiller and rookie Frederik Andersen, many felt that the Ducks were primed to be a top contender for the Stanley Cup.\nThe Ducks remained towards the top of the NHL standings for the entire season, ending the regular season with a franchise-best 54\u201320\u20138 record (116 points) and eventually finishing one point behind the Boston Bruins in the race for the Presidents' Trophy, awarded to the team finishing the regular season with the best record. The Ducks secured a second consecutive Pacific Division title and the number one seed in the Western Conference. Anaheim faced the eighth-seeded Dallas Stars in the Western Conference quarter-finals and were victorious in six games, marking the first time since 2009 that the Ducks had won a playoff series. In the Western Conference semi-finals, the Ducks faced their geographic rival and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings for the first time ever in the playoffs. In a hotly contested series, the Ducks ultimately went down in seven games to their Southern Californian rivals, losing Game 7 by a score of 6\u20132 at the Honda Center.\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks acquired center Ryan Kesler and a third-round pick in 2015 from the Vancouver Canucks. In the following season, they would win their third-straight Pacific Division title and finish as the top seed in the West with 109 points. In the 2015 playoffs, they swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round and beat the Calgary Flames in five games to set up a Western Conference final against the Chicago Blackhawks. After taking three games to two series lead on the strong play of goaltender Frederik Andersen, the Ducks lost the final two games of the series, including Game 7 on home ice. This marked the third-straight season the Ducks had lost a series in Game 7 at home after leading the series three games to two.On July 15, 2015, the Ducks signed Ryan Kesler to a six-year contract extension totaling a reported $41.25 million. Just prior to the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the Ducks sent Emerson Etem and a draft pick to the New York Rangers in exchange for speedy left-wing Carl Hagelin. They also traded for Vancouver Canucks defenseman Kevin Bieksa and adding veterans Shawn Horcoff, Chris Stewart and Mike Santorelli. Entering the 2015\u201316 NHL season, many analysts pegged the Ducks as Stanley Cup favorites. However, scoring struggles led to a slow start, with the team still out of a playoff spot in December. The team improved afterwards riding the goaltending of John Gibson. On March 6, 2016, the Ducks set a franchise record with an 11-game winning streak which ended the following night. On March 24, 2016, the Ducks clinched a playoff spot in a 6\u20135 overtime loss to the Maple Leafs. However, in the first round of the playoffs, they fell in seven games to the Nashville Predators, which led to the firing of head coach Bruce Boudreau. On June 14, 2016, the Ducks announced they re-hired former head coach Randy Carlyle.On May 10, 2017, the Ducks ended their Game 7 losing streak when they defeated the Edmonton Oilers, winning the series 4\u20133 and advancing to the Western Conference finals for the second time in three seasons. They would fall to the Nashville Predators in Game 6, ending their playoff run. In the following season, the Ducks failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time since the 2011\u201312 season. They clinched the playoffs, but were swept by the San Jose Sharks in the First Round. In 2019, the Ducks fired Carlyle and replaced him with Bob Murray as interim, however the Ducks missed the playoffs.\n\n\n== Team information ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\nFounded in 1993, the then-called Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were directly named for The Mighty Ducks movies. When The Walt Disney Company, which produced the movies and owned the NHL team, sold the team in 2005, the name was shortened to its current state, \"Anaheim Ducks.\"\n\n\n=== Uniforms ===\nThe Ducks have officially worn three unique regular jerseys and five unique third jerseys in their franchise history. The original jerseys of the Ducks (then the Mighty Ducks) used jade green, purple, white and grey as primary colors for both the home and away jerseys. The team's dark jerseys were dominantly purple in color with diagonal gray and white stripes; the jersey is jade green below the stripes, which appear on the arms and waist, and the collar was jade and white. The white jerseys were similar, except that the purple is replaced mainly with white and the collar is completely purple in color. In 1996, shoulder patches were added to both jerseys featuring a forward-facing version of the main logo's \"duck mask\", surrounded by a circle reading \"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\". The hockey pants also had a jade stripe on the sides that was eliminated after the Ducks' 2003 Stanley Cup run and heading into the 2003\u201304 season.\nAbout a year after the team was purchased from the Walt Disney Company by the Samuelis, Brian Burke initiated a name change dropping the \"Mighty\" after consultation with the fans showed that the typical fan had a willingness to update the \"Mighty Ducks\" name and jersey and also a desire to keep part of the traditions of the franchise. Burke sought inspiration for the jersey from the United States Military Academy, ending up with diagonal gold, white, black and orange stripes down the arms and waist with the word \"Ducks\" on the front. The jersey is similar to the team's most recent third jersey prior to the name change. The orange pays tribute to Orange County, where Anaheim is located.\nFor the 2007\u201308 NHL season, the Ducks, like all NHL teams, changed over to new Reebok Edge jerseys. The new team jersey shows only minor modifications from the 2006\u201307 season's jerseys, including a small NHL crest just below the neck, and a smaller ducks logo on the chest. After the first year of the Edge uniform system being in place, the Ducks increased the size of their logo. The Ducks would use these uniforms as their primary uniforms until the 2013\u201314 season.\nOn June 27, 2014, the Ducks unveiled their new uniforms that were based on the 2010\u20132014 alternate jerseys. Changes to the collar and number font were included.\n\n\n==== Alternate uniforms ====\nThe third jerseys of the Ducks were created in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2010, 2015, 2018 and 2019. The 1995 jersey was jade green with purple and white stripes on the collar and on the end of the sleeves. The logo was of team mascot Wildwing wearing a Mighty Ducks jersey while breaking through a sheet of ice. The jersey was short-lived; as severe criticism encouraged management to retire the jersey at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.\nThe 1997 third jersey came with a rare fourth jersey partner. The third was a jade green-colored jersey with silver and purple stripes at the shoulders outlined in thin yellow, and a silver stripe at the bottom. It had the Mighty Ducks logo in the center of the chest. The fourth jersey was much like it. It was white with jade green, purple, and silver stripes at the shoulders of the jersey, but no bottom stripe. The eggplant pants were also briefly shelved in favor of black pants. These jerseys saw action until the end of 1999\u20132000, when they stopped playing with their third jerseys, and used only the fourth (the eggplant pants were also restored). At the end of 1999\u20132000, the fourth was also retired.\nThe 2003 third jersey was black with purple and gray stripes at the waist and on the sleeves. It had the alternate script logo of the present Mighty Ducks and old-style laces at the neck, as well as a shoulder patch displaying an interlocking \"MD\" (for \"Mighty Ducks\"). The popularity of this jersey amongst fans was so great it replaced the purple and jade jersey, serving as the home jersey for the last half of the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs. It was dropped following the season as the team went to a modified name, new uniforms, and color scheme; however, this popular jersey influenced the design of the new jerseys for 2006\u201307. It was the only time in the modern NHL days when a mainly black jersey was not worn with black pants; instead, the pants were purple.\nThe 2010 third jersey was officially unveiled on November 26, 2010, against the Chicago Blackhawks, the day after Thanksgiving. The jersey features the webbed \"D\" on the chest with the recolored Mighty Ducks logo on each shoulder. It features striping similar to the regular uniforms, and orange is much more prominent as a secondary color. In June 2014, the third jersey was made as the Ducks' primary home jersey, alongside a white one in the same style for away.On October 16, 2015, the Ducks unveiled a brand new, orange third jersey when they went up against the Colorado Avalanche. This jersey brought back the old Mighty Ducks logo and features a black collar with the \"Anaheim\" wordmark on the left side, the \nwebbed \"D\" logo on the shoulders, and unique stripes that go along with the team's home socks.\nFor their Stadium Series game on January 25, 2014, the Ducks created a special jersey. This jersey is primarily orange with black lettering and numbers. The chromed Ducks logo, designed for the Stadium Series, is on the chest. There are gold, black and white stripes on the sleeves as well as black trim around the bottom and sleeves. The jersey has old fashion black lace on the neck and also has a unique \"OC\" logo on the left shoulder to represent Orange County where the Ducks are from.The Ducks announced for their 25th anniversary season of 2018\u201319 the adoption of a new third jersey that features the franchise's original colors of eggplant and jade. The uniform was only used for that particular season, after which the Ducks returned to the orange thirds last used from 2015\u201317.\nTheir 2019-20 season third jersey was officially announced September 2019 and debuted in their October 5, 2019 game against San Jose. Although the design closely resembled a previous jersey, the new jersey reflects the sponsorship with Adidas, and the collar is exclusively black.\n\n\n==== Colors and logos ====\n\nThe team's colors were purple and jade until the change of ownership in 2006. At this point, they became orange, black and gold, with white in place of black for the away jersey. The only exception is the alternate jersey, which is mostly orange. Orange, which has become one of the team's primary colors, is in reference to Orange County, where Anaheim is located.The Ducks' logo features a webbed foot forming a \"D\". The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) with orange and black accents (forming a three-dimensional appearance). The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver. This is shortened from a prior version that spelled out the word \"Ducks\" in all capital letters.\nThe old logo of the Ducks prior to the name change featured an old-style goaltender mask, shaped to form the appearance of a duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting hockey sticks, a black hockey puck, and a triangle; the color of the triangle was either green or gray, depending on how the logo is used. This is now used on a shoulder patch of the current uniforms, with the triangle in orange.\n\n\n=== Mascot ===\nThe official mascot for the Anaheim Ducks is an anthropomorphized duck by the name of Wild Wing. He has been the team's mascot since its inaugural season, and his name was chosen through fan voting. He wears a Ducks jersey with the number 93 on the back, referring to the year the Ducks became an NHL team.\n\nHe regularly descends from the rafters of the arena when making his in-game entrances. In one such descent the rigging that lowered Wild Wing from the rafters malfunctioned leaving the mascot trapped fifty feet above the ice for several minutes. Another well known blunder occurred in October 1995 when Wild Wing, attempting to jump through a \"wall of fire\", accidentally tripped causing the mascot to land on the fire and set his costume ablaze.His physical appearance is similar to the duck mask in the original Mighty Ducks logo. A bronze statue of Wild Wing was located outside the south doors of Honda Center from 1993 to 2012, until construction began on the 'Grand Terrace' addition to the arena. When construction was completed and the Grand Terrace opened in October 2013, the statue was noticeably absent.\nThe mascot's name was also used for the leader of the Ducks, Wildwing Flashblade, in Disney's Mighty Ducks cartoon series.\nDuring the same time in which the team announced a name change as well as change in jersey designs, there was an attempt by the team's owners to change or replace the mascot, Wild Wing, but was halted after a highly successful petition by fans.The Mighty Ducks also used a secondary \"mascot\", a person (with no particular costume) called \"The Iceman\", during the team's first game in 1993. \"The Iceman\" appeared occasionally in the stands, played an electric guitar, and attempted to liven up the crowd. However, \"The Iceman\" was poorly received by fans and was quickly eliminated as the Ducks lost to the Red Wings in their inaugural game, 7-2.\n\n\n=== Rivalries ===\nThe Ducks have two rivalries with two teams out of geographical proximity. The Freeway Face-Off with the Los Angeles Kings as both teams arenas are accessible via Interstate 5 in California and the fact that both teams are within the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. The Ducks also have a rivalry with the San Jose Sharks. Despite the arenas being six hours away from each other, the teams have developed a strong rivalry, primarily from the 2009 and 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Ducks won the series in 2009, but the Sharks came back in 2018.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Ducks.

          "My first visit. It's a beautiful stadium. Nice hotel within walking distance. They have beers for just $4.50 and they had a sale section in their souvenir shop...shirts and hats for less than $10. Plus all the ushers and other staff were very friendly. Check out their",
          "The tickets are cheap, if you can go to a game it is worth it! Really well organized good prices, you can relax and enjoy, you can go with children too",
          "The 4th level dose not go all the way around. It was a Sunday afternoon game so that maybe why they didn\u2019t have a lot of the places open. The outside of the stadium is really cool. There is a rock fountain in the out field and that is a neat feature as well. It is nice to look",
          "We saw the Angels play our beloved Red Sox one night and we enjoyed ourselves even though the Sox lost. They had terrific fireworks at the end of the game which my 1 1/2 yo granddaughter loved. The fans were, for the most part, polite. However, we did have one couple state",
          "Got the see the Rays and Angels and had a good time. Lots of good seating was available at reasonable prices. We sat a couple rows off the field on first base side and had wonderful site lines. Although the afternoon was steamy hot it was a very comfortable evening. Good",
          "First time ever going to a A\u2019s game! We had a blast. The staff was so helpful to make sure we got to our seats and even had a treat for a live concert from Lauren Hill! We had a firework show and even had the opportunity to met and take photos with Chuck Finley. A trip for the",
          "The best part of the game was the fireworks on the Saturday. Ball park entertainment was lack luster and I found myself bored at the game. Vendors in the stands sell almost everything but I never saw a beer vendor walk around. Section 135 is fully obstructed view to center",
          "I have visited ball parks all over the US and this is one of my favourites. We had a very nice Sunday at the ball game sitting in the California sun. Plenty of parking",
          "Even though this is a very old park (1966) it has been upgraded many times and looks pretty state of the art to me. Huge video boards all over the place. Every seat is a good seat. The sightlines are excellent. I can't speak to the food but the beer is always cold and fresh.",
          "We attended an evening game and enjoyed the stadium. It is a pretty park with good sight lines. You are able to walk all the way around the stadium to get to see the whole place. Place was not full but people were still into the game. Also were lucky enough to catch it on",
          "Caught the Astros against the Halos on a picturesque Thursday evening. Place was half-full but the in-game vibe was excellent. Angel Stadium is one of the older parks in MLB, but thanks to several tasteful renovations the in-game experience keeps up with the majority of parks",
          "We attended a Angels/ red socks game and enjoyed this stadium, the food, and the nice people of Anaheim. It\u2019s too bad the angels don\u2019t have much fan support, I think there were 2/1 red socks fans at the stadium. We had fun though.",
          "What a fun day! We were dropped off our front by Uber and signed up right away to get a free Angels t shirt. We bought our tickets at the door and there were lots. My only suggestion would be to make Uber pick up easier. We walked so far to find our car.",
          "Not the fanciest stadium in the US, but lots of food/drink/dessert vendors of all types/cuisine. I like the ease of parking ($10 fee) and easy walk to the stadium/seating. I usually sit out in the left field family pavilion....easty ramps to walk up from entrance gate, restrooms",
          "Went to my first ball game since i moved to the US, Angels v White Socks. What a great experience, plenty to see, eat and drink. Helmets full of nacho's, hot dogs to name but a few. The beer is over priced, but what else are you going to buy. They make it a great spectacle",
          "Great ballpark. Easy access, easy parking, vendors were courteous and customer service oriented. All seats were good.",
          "We were visiting Disneyland and Angel Stadium is a 15 minute drive away. It was 70s throwback weekend so they had free shirts and hysterical 70s jokes on the jumbotron. Everyone was nice and the seats were good. A fun ballpark. The ice cream sundae was delicious and generous.",
          "I love ANGELS STADIUM! The overall fan experience here is amazing, it's just a great park. I've been coming here to watch the Angels my entire life. The improvements made to the park over the years are awesome. It's always fresh, clean, great amenities and overall just done",
          "Every Saturday night after the Angels game, it\u2019s Big Bang Fireworks. It\u2019s one of the best firework shows around and most Saturday nights, the Angels win when we go! Steve Concialdi",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Angel Stadium to watch the Angels play. It was our first taste of US baseball and we loved it. We have seats out of the sun which was great sit was a hot day. The Angels won! We now have a US baseball team to follow.",
          "Always a fun time at Angel Stadium! My favorite place to sit is behind home plate all the way at the top. Amazing view of the game and a great place to watch the fireworks. Love how clean they keep the stadium too and the staff is always so friendly. No complaints from this",
          "Parking was easy and fast. Everyone who works there was super nice. Very clean and well kept up. I would go back",
          "Went to see an Orioles game and enjoyed the food and drink options in the stadium and the great weather and scenery. Great place to spend time watching a game with the family.",
          "Not bad,but not great. An average ballpark experience at best. I was not overly impressed with the experience.",
          "This was our first trip to Angels Stadium and we were thoroughly impressed with how beautiful it was. Loved the fact that their post-game show was held right outside where people could actually watch it.",
          "Staff were significantly more friendly than most parks maybe because of the Disney ownership influence still lingering from couple of decades ago. Concession was outrageous with a beer costing around fifteen dollars and a bag of kettle corn costing almost ten. The atmosphere",
          "I have been here several times in my life. I love the new connection that they made in the car pool lane that is so easy to get there from the 405 freeway, it only took us 15 mins in traffic rush hour. I was very pleased with that. Other then that it is a first rate ball",
          "I love this stadium. One of my favorite in California. I normally go to watch the Yankees play. The stadium is always clean, great views and close to hotels. I've never had a bad experience with fans or parking.",
          "Ok. It is fun to watch baseball even if the Angels are playing 500 ball. The stadium is easy to get by by Angel express (train) or driving in. Find shaded seats if you are seeing a day game. Lots of food and drinks to choose from. Try the restaurants behind outfield.",
          "Nicely setup stadium with plenty of parking and lots of food choices. Overall a fun family location. Sunday afternoon game with lots of seats in the shade.",
          "While in town for business, a coworker and myself decided to catch a game. We were able to get seats 8 rows from the field for half price. The park was a great park as it was my first time there. Parking was cheap ($10) on site at the park. As most parks, the food and beer is",
          "I happen to be in town on business and was able to catch a Monday night baseball game between the Angels and the Dodgers. Did not purchase my ticket in advance so had to buy at the window, a little on the steep side $100 but had a very good seat along the third-base side. The",
          "A lot of people complain that the stadium is dated, and needs to be renovated and modernized, but it is clean and well-maintained, and that goes a long way, at least for me. We always focus on the newest and greatest thing, but baseball transcends, or should transcend, all of",
          "Not quite as boring as the \"donut\" shaped all-purpose venues of the 70's, but this 1966 park can't hold a candle to the downtown venues that are popping up elsewhere in the majors. Although it's undergone some rehabs over the years, we found weird stuff like the row letters",
          "We went here to watch a game on a Saturday night. We required accessible seating and it was available as was parking. All the staff were very helpful. I thought that food and drink were expensive compared to other baseball grounds I have attended. I'm also baffled that there are",
          "A fun baseball stadium with all the facilities you'd require. Lots of bars and restaurants inside. The outside main entrance is most fun with giant baseball caps, bats and balls.",
          "Enjoyed two games here vs Mariners this month. Took family to their first game in a long while. Saw a loss on the first night, and a great win on the second night. Back to back to back home runs was pretty exciting. Saturday Night Fireworks were great too.",
          "I enjoy going to different ball parks and first time in LA that the Angels were in town. Good park showing it\u2019s age inside the seating areas. Lots of food options and beer options as well. Fun watching ad they played the Dodgers, so two for one.",
          "This was our first visit to Angel Stadium for an Angels game and it was great. Convenient location. Food/drink a little pricey, but guess comparable to similar parks/venues. Staff very friendly/helpful. Check out the Angels store which has limited merchandise, but also items not",
          "Angel Stadium is the fourth oldest active MLB ballpark, although it's in fairly decent shape due to some renovations over the years. Perhaps the best feature is the waterfall in the outfield, from which fireworks and flames shoot out during home run celebrations. The announced",
          "All the employees were wonderful ! From the woman at the ticket booth, ushers, concessions etc. We just bought cheap seats up high so we could look out at the freeway during dull moments. Unfortunately for us the game kind of ground to a halt after 3 innings. I love baseball,",
          "a great stadium!! just don't forget to order your hot dog while watching a game, specially good if you do it with your family",
          "We took the whole family to Angels Stadium and did the tour. This was my first tour. No one in the family is a real baseball fan but they all had fun! Eddie Morales was our tour guide. Eddie made it interesting and fun! He may have turned some of our family members into",
          "Wow, what a great tour. On time, enthusiastic, and passionate. I have toured half of the ballparks in the US... this one is probably at the top of my favorites now. Not only did they tell great historical stories and facts, they cared about the individuals on the tour and their",
          "Whats a trip to the USA without a trip to a baseball game. 1st time doing it and if I ever go back will definately do Angel stadium. The stadium is a definate eye catcher ( even though we came through the back carpark) with the large A Opposite the freeway to the rock waterfall",
          "Love to venture out to the ball game for an evening. GO ANGElS Parking is hard to remember where you park unless you have up front parking.",
          "This is definitely a great place to watch a baseball game. The weather is great and the view from almost any seat is good. The third base side seemed to have less sun during the day. The second deck had good views and the prices for tickets were really reasonable. The park",
          "Out of all the Southern California stadiums, Angel Stadium is by far the best one. And their tour was great, very knowledgeable and entertaining. I was so disappointed that there were no games while I was in town. The tour took us to Gene Autry's suite, the dugout suites, the",
          "We took and Uber to the park, dropped us right in front, everything was laid out well, easy to find our seats, food and beverages. The game was good, a little slow moving for the kids(age 13 & 11), Previous to leaving for this vacation, I found out that you can do birthday",
          "We have been to the stadium many times over the past five years and each time we have a great time. Our most recent time at the stadium was the best! We were in town my my sweetie's birthday and I had tickets for section 117. We've never sat in that section before so I had no",
          "I had three students with me competing at BPA Nationals and two of them had never been to a MLB ballgame before. I knew we had to go. The park was easy to get there. Easy access and good signage. Lots of ample seating as well. The nights can get cool so you need to prepare",
          "We had a great time and good seats for the game. First game for us from Vancouver island Canada. Used a Uber to get to game and back to the hotel very easy to use.",
          "I could feel great atmosphere in the stadium. When I came here, I unfortunately didn\u2019t watch Ohtani-San. But I\u2019ve already been looking forward to coming to this place again in the near future.",
          "I truly enjoyed my visit to Agnel's Stadium. It looked like no matter where you sat the view was excellent. They had a wide variety of foods beyond hotdogs and burgers. You can't go wrong taking in a game.",
          "An older feel to the stadium made it feel even better, even though we were there for the NY Yankees staff was super friendly. Quality food, beverage and spirits many local breweries. Sight lines are good from all over. One of the last stadiums i can remember buying a 12oz can",
          "We visited the stadium on Easter Sunday this year on our way home from San Diego. We had almost an entire section to ourselves! Parking is ample and reasonably priced. Standard food choices. Overall clean park.",
          "Great older ballpark with really, friendly staff and fans. Plenty of parking and entry gates around the entire stadium. Don't know how much longer the Angles will be there as they want a new facility. We enjoyed this big old park!",
          "Nothing to do around the park except to park & go into the game. Intentionally bought tickets in CF to witness one of the best players of our time up close. (Reasonable). Got there early for BP, recommend that, bring your glove, lots of bombs! After 30 minutes of that, ventured",
          "I am used to Tropicana Field, and enjoy the climate controlled environment and great food selections. Angels stadium is clean and very nice looking. The food choices were OK, but many ball parks are more adventurous. The atmosphere was good and score board was great. Great",
          "I grew up in LA and my first visit to Angels Stadium was last Thursday. I have wasted a lot of time not going! It is beautiful and very well kept up. There is a beautiful waterfall and fireworks every time there is a home run. The score board is so simple to navigate. The",
          "We had a special event for work at Angel Stadium. It's not somewhere that I would think of to host an event but was I in for a treat! There were appetizers in the Lexus Diamond Club. Followed by a announcements and recognition in the seats behind home plate. From there you",
          "Angel Stadium is easily accessible by car with plenty of on-site parking. The stadium is well maintained, the staff (ushers, vendors, ticket sales, etc.) are polite and helpful, sight lines are good from all areas of the stadium, and food quality is decent although food prices",
          "We went here for a baseball game and all of the seats had a perfect view of teh field! Very easy to buy last minute tickets too! This stadium is a very neat and worth checking out!",
          "Went to purchase Trout and Otani shirts. We were able to park right up front. The ladies were friendly and helpful. Lots of merchandise were available. There is no restroom access. Luckily there was a California high school baseball game going on so we could go in for free",
          "Had tons of fun at the game. The food was good and the rum and coke slushes were even better. Staff was all very friendly.",
          "If you happen to be in the area and you want to catch a baseball game, I'd recommend to go and see the Angels play at their stadium in Anaheim! It is a pretty modern, well-structured stadium with plenty of stores and activities for you to attend before, during and after the",
          "Awesomely me baseball park recommend to everyone Great for the kids for anyone who loves baseball kids had fun",
          "My wife's sister and her husband live very close and we didn't have a chance to see a game (Angels out of town) so walked around a took pictures. Kind of strange to think that this is now one of the oldest stadium in the majors. (Doesn't come anywhere close to Fenway and",
          "Saw the A's versus the Angels. Very nice stadium and love the main entrance. Despite the age it doesn't show. No bad sight lines whatsoever. Parking at the stadium was good and fair in cost. My only complaint and that is for all sports venues is the cost of concessions are way",
          "We had a great view on upper tier watching Angel's v Rangers - 1st ever baseball game with family and everyone had a blast. The food was great (if you are counting calories get a leave pass) particularly the 'Angel dogs' hotdog and we had to get a Nacho Helmet - as a souvenir",
          "Watching a baseball game at the Angel Stadium is a must if you are near the area. Players like MIke Trout and Shohei Otahni make the experience something incredible. It\u00b4s a Major League game! You can\u00b4t waste it!",
          "Whenever I go to a new city, if there is a sporting event, I try to go to it. I have been to several baseball parks and this one is really nice. It wasn't hard to find and parking was easy. We had food and it was very good. I would recommend going to a game at this park.",
          "It was a last minute decision to go to a game and we are so glad we did. Excellent seats still available at $10 each. Crowd was a little quieter than we were used to and so many locals left around the 6th inning. We were visiting Anaheim and really enjoyed the lovely weather and",
          "My son (who is autistic and a BIG sports fan) asked if we could drive by the stadium when we were on flex day on our Disneyland trip. We were driving around the stadium and he asked if they have tours. I googled and found out that they have several tours most days. We walked in",
          "While I have reviewed Angel Stadium previously from a perspective of a fan, this time I'm reviewing another aspect of the stadium, the Stadium Tour. So, lets get to it. The Tour...The Tour itself is about an hour to an hour and a half. The knowledgeable Angles Staff take you",
          "We stopped off in Anaheim to break up our drive from San Francisco to Las Vegas. We wanted to catch a baseball match on our trip and this provided the perfect opportunity. Albeit the Angels were unable to win this did not dampen our first experience. The staff at the stadium",
          "I\u2019m not an Angels fan but I had time to catch a game with some friends and we had a really good time. We had good seats on the left field foul pole in the \u201cTrout Farm.\u201d They gave us free Mike Trout hats just for sitting there. And we got half off our tickets for being veterans.",
          "Don\u2019t think you can go wrong with any seat in this stadium! Really enjoyed the game,only problem was getting a taxi to pick up,they wouldn\u2019t come into the parking area after the game !?",
          "Other than the team not really having any kind of secure identity because of all the name changes, the stadium is still the place back in the 70s where I saw the Beach Boys rock the mezzanine up and down to \u201cI Get Around\u201d. The non-Disney areas of Anaheim could use a little",
          "We had fun at the stadium. Fireworks were shown during the pledge as well as the home run. Great to watch. The staff was friendly and helpful. Very clean.",
          "Great view. The server was fantastic. Beer was cold and it was convenient to our hotel. Minimal crowds this time of year also.",
          "Nice park would go back again if they are in town when I am there. We ubered in and out but noticed that the parking was cheap.",
          "This was our 1st time that we have been to a game of Baseball in America, wow what a great night at Angel Stadium we love the way it is set out with the waterfall feature in the background. This was our first game of Baseball so we deck ourselves out with Angels gear, the game",
          "I learned to enjoy baseball on my first trip to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. I was tempted to stop enjoying baseball after a trip to Angel Stadium in Anaheim. The people there were always rude or at best abrupt and I always had the feeling I was not wanted there. Dodger",
          "Visiting from out of town, figured we'd check out a game. Nice classic park, open air, natural feeling. Nice waterfall. Friendly ushers. Everything you need in a ballpark really!",
          "We saw the Angel's play the Astros Saturday night. The stadium is extremely well designed. A beautiful waterfall is just beyond ce nter field. The seats were comfortable. Restrooms and stores were pleantiful and the food was outstanding. I highly recommend the stadium.",
          "Angel Stadium is fine. The sight lines are decent. The parking is beyond ample. The food is mostly edible. The staff is nice enough. The team currently features the best player in baseball. Still, there is absolutely nothing about Angel Stadium that makes it stand out. It",
          "We've been season ticket holders for the baseball team for years. This Stadium is constantly changing, esp. with restaurants and bars. No need to eat before the game that's for sure. However, I must add that the food prices are CRAZY!!! But still fun!",
          "A large group of family and friends like to get together to go to an Angels game several times a season. Good food, good beer and great company with atmosphere!",
          "I have been coming here most of my life. As a boy I lived very close by and we would go to games all the time. We always sat right behind the Angeles dugout. Saw so many great players through the years I could tell you how many. Unfortunately I wasn't their when the won the",
          "Gluten free: In these days most places are becoming educated in providing options for those who have a gluten allergy or sensitivity to gluten. As with most states California sets the bar with just about everything, but after looking up all MLB stadiums that provide gluten free",
          "This was a fun stadium to visit and you can see the CA mountains while enjoying the ball park. The main entrance has 2 large Angels baseball caps as you walk in. There was more than one team store and plenty of food choices. Parking was only $10 in general parking.",
          "We have seen the Angels play each time we have stayed in California. The atmosphere is amazing, the team fantastic and it's a great way to soak up the American way of life. Food and drink is good value and the views are fantastic. Great souvenirs shop too.",
          "Being the huge baseball fan that he is one of my sons insists we attend a baseball game in any city we visit. As luck would have it the Angels were in town. It was an afternoon game and there were plenty of kids camps in attendance. The park itself is nothing special, but",
          "My wife and I took our 6 year old to the Sunday game against the Oakland A's, and although I wasn't a huge fan of baseball, this ended up being a great day out for the entire family. The first 10,000 kids were given a free youth shirt, and then we went into the Angels store and",
          "Very large stadium with some very large caps out front. Good view lines to the field and the seats were very comfortable. The rock falls beyond the outfield walls didn't impress and could tell they weren't real. Not much to see around the park. Good place to watch a ball game",
          "Our family is trying to make the rounds and hit all of the stadiums. We had a great time at Angels versus Dodgers game. Good thing the angels won that made it better. :) The thing that set apart the Angels game for me was the loaded nachos they were an absolute must have .!!",
          "Went on a Saturday night - the fireworks were amazing and the show after was great. Our kids said the fireworks were better than Disney!",
          "Went to a great game but the Angles lost. What stands out the most was the customer service. I was carrying my food back to my seats and I dropped my jumbo hotdog. A young lady from behind her coffee booth came running and insisted that she get me another hotdog. Any other",

          "I make a trip here every year and found some pretty horrible seats. If you sit in the 500 section, do not sit in the first or second row. The walkway in front of you is filled with people impeding your sight the entire game. Sit higher or lower, but not right on the walk way.",
          "Got to see Trout homer! Was an excellent time. Nice stadium that's easy to get to. Seats were reasonable for MLB. Concessions had good variety and weren't too expensive. Good fireworks show afterwards.",
          "My husband & I took our girls, ages 11 & 13. We had a great time. The ballpark is beautiful. We had great seats, even though they were in the outfield, then we got to watch fireworks & a movie on the jumbo screen. A bonus of watching the movie was that a lot of people left, so",

          "We live in Florida but are big Angels fans that were delighted to catch a game while visiting family. The stadium is very nicely laid out for good pedestrian flow. Getting in and out of the stadium is a piece of cake. Parking outside is also ample and easy. General parking",

          "We attended a game when they played the dodgers there were more dodger fans there. We sat in section 101 which is trout farm and got a hat. The tickets were pricey and was slightly disappointed due to the fact that the bullpens blocked part of the view to the field. Stadium is",

          "This was my second visit to Angel Stadium although the first time was 11 years ago. Other than new scoreboards for this year I don\u2019t think much has changed. Surprisingly Angel Stadium is the 4th oldest MLB stadium and is the only permanent home the Angels have ever had. It is",

          "First visit to the park. While it is one of the older stadiums in use, it showed only graceful well worn age. All facilities were clean, easily assessable and well located. The field looked great. The scoreboards are as large and easy to see as any other park in the league.",
          "We love baseball and this was a fun stadium to go to! Clean and everyone was super nice! Great food selection! Lots of local beers on tap. We sat up high (but not too high!) and enjoyed the view. Really nice people all around. The seats could have been a little more comfortable,",
          "Went to my first Angels game recently and it was a great experience! We sat pretty high up so the tickets were only $20 and the view was still great. Plenty of food choices at usual stadium prices...nachos in a helmet were $18, beers were $14.50 for a tall can. The fan stores",
          "We've been fortunate enough to go to a few ballparks across the country. I truly love this stadium. It is always very clean, the food is good, the beer is great, and the viewing is decent. It can get WARM here, but other than that, a great place to put on your list of sights",

          "Angels stadium is on the last of the stadiums from the 60's and 70's that featured the big concrete ramps from the ground to the upper deck, interior concourses with no field view, etc. It is like stepping back in time until you get to the seating bowl. They have done a nice job",

          "Was there to see the 600 home run for Pujoles. An amazing time and so thrilled to share this first time visit to baseball with my best friend. Lucky I don't live in the states as i would have to have a second job to pay for tickets for every game.",

          "In our quest to visit all 30 MLB parks, Angel Stadium rates near the top. I don't believe there is a bad seat in the park. The staff is very well trained and friendly and knowledgable. The signage is awesome, think of what you want to eat and signs will direct you to the correct",

          "I haven't been here in a few years. Seems like a new place with the new score boards. STaff was friendly and the place clean. Sat behind home plate and had a great view of the game and the Honda Center in the background. My big beef is the place ran out of pizza in the second",

          "It was a great time watching the Angels play at home! Also we had great seats on the third base side with shade! It was awesome to have a night out with my sons! With the tickets on the phone, it was so easy! Also we all received a bobble head!",

          "Parking was confusing with random blocking all over. The spacing in front of the seat made it hard to go get food. The BBQ pulled pork was Amazing. Every thing else was unimpressive. Service was extremely slow. Elevator had a very nice attendant which is a nice touch. Overall",
          "Beautiful ballpark. There is plenty of onsite parking, $10 for regular or $20 for VIP. No bus stops near the stadium that I am aware of. Ticket prices and concession prices are expensive compared to other ballparks that I've been to. Overall, a very pleasant place to watch a",

          "This really is one of the nicest stadiums. I hadn't been in awhile but got some Diamond Club seats on StubHub. Talk about making you feel like a VIP. But even without this premium seating, this is a clean, safe, family friendly park with very friendly fans",
          "A friend and I went to a game this past weekend. The stadium is a good blend of the older stadiums and updates to make it more modern and like the newer ones. Tons of parking, good seats regardless of where you are, reasonable prices on food and drinks. Will for sure go again.",

          "Personally I don't really like baseball, but the atmosphere, the people watching and the overall experience is really fun and makes it worth a visit. The food is excellent (hot dogs are yummo!), and there are lots of drinks available (including cocktails for people that don't",
          "I love the Angels. The only way I know to truly appreciate then is to go to an Angel game. The stadium is fairly nice given how old it is. There are very few bad spots to sit in. The food changes from year to year but you'll always have your hotdogs, nachos, and peanuts.",
          "We checked out the Angels baseball game against the Seattle mariners last Sunday. Sunday matinee games are cool as the kids can run the bases at the end of the game. Very easy to get to the stadium, and parking was simple. Ballpark was clean and the staff was friendly. Prices",

          "Awesome parking, awesome team, awesome freebies, awesome time! I went with my fiance to see the baseball game, the parking was very easy and we had a great time. If you don't want to spend a lot, and depending on what game it is... just get tickets to higher seats and move down",
          "Went like always to the Christmas in June event the Angels hold. Once again in was great fun. The people are great at this ballpark unlike Dodger Stadium. There is no ugly fan stupidity here. Root for the other team there is no fan violence. Everyone is there to enjoy the game.",
          "We busted up to Anaheim for a Dodger game with the rival Angels. Now I don't think of Anaheim as a great baseball stadium, and I've been to most. But it isn't terrible. The traffic folks in the stadium and police outside the park get masses in and out better than I would have",
          "I have been here many times over the last 30 plus years, and as a baseball fan, I always love going to a game. However, when I am paying $175 face for a ticket and thus $350 for my wife and I to walk in to the stadium, I just expect a bit more. I get the concept of a hot dog",
          "I got free tickets from work in the Diamond Club, which are Field Level seats right behind home plate. They came with premium parking, which is insanely close, and waiter service at your seats. It was an amazing experience. The stadium is beautiful and clean. The staff I dealt",

          "While in town for work I stopped for a ballgame. In an age where a 25 year old stadium is old, Angel Stadium shows it's age. This never distracted from the play but it didn't add to it. Sure the nostalgia is there but not like the famous old ballparks.",
          "It was my first visit at this stadium and it was for an Angel's game. This building is old but still in very good condition. We had a very nice baseball night. Everything inside the stadium was perfect. The seats are a little tight for 2 big guys sitting next to each other but",

          "We got tickets to watch the Angels play and from the moment we walked in we got caught up in the excitement with free bubbleheads of the popular player to big beers and hot dogs. Staff were very friendly and helpful with we're we needed to be. Great place to visit Oh and it",
          "The Big A was much better than expected for an older park. I've been to marlins stadium, comerica park, the trop, and petco and this park has its own feel. Went on a rally monkey night! The park was half full but the in game experiences was good and stadium experience was great!",
          "Very nice ballpark. Friendly staff. Good food selections. Great fans. Would definitely go back for another game.",
          ".........but a little dated at this point. We enjoyed our time here, but found the sight lines lacking and the common areas tight. Still an excellent evening out. Maybe it really is about the baseball (and not the facility).",

          "Loved this Stadium. I got there early and asked one of the attendants where theist food was. He sent me to the BBQ stand - one outside the lower level and one on the second level. Might have been one of the priciest choices, but a great pulled pork sandwich. Also of note",
          "I came to Angel Stadium to watch a Angels game mid week in May and overall I was impressed, the tickets were cheap and there was a laid back atmosphere. The downside is the food and drinks prices were extortionate so it's probably best to eat before.",
          "It had been a while since I'd been to a game, and it was great. We went with a group for my daughter's school. The parking was right there within walking distance to the entrance and ticket pick up. There were no lines that we had to wait in. All of the staff were friendly",
          "Since I moved to Vegas I have made 4 trips to this ballpark. The seating is very good with good leg room and good observation. We were five rows back from the dugout which made the tickets price but, since this is every three year trip we wanted to have good seats. There are",

          "I went here in 2012 with my family and I must say that this is one of the best ballparks I've been to. I really liked the big baseball hats outside the park. This ballpark has a great layout and I can't recommend this place enough. If you're planning to visit Anaheim I would",

          "We went for the SUPERCROSS event and it was pretty awesome!",
          "We took the family to Harvest Crusade. The isles are so skinny that once you sit down you will not be moving until the event is over. I hope you already have your food/drinks because you are stuck once in your seat. God save everyone if \u2026",

          "Was visiting for my b'day with daughter, son-in-law and my friend.  GREAT game, really good seats and nice stadium, but a boring crowd. Used to the Oakland A's fans. Canned music and cheers didn't last long enough to get the fans \u2026",

          "I have been going to Angel games here since the days when the \u201cBig A\u201d lived just past the wall in center field. The stadium is easy to navigate, the parking is good and getting to and from a freeway is not a traumatic ordeal. It\u2019s also nice \u2026",

          "Cool clean stadium but compared to other MLB ball parks I've been to its pretty dull.\nThe center field waterfall is cool but the concorse has nothing to see outside the standard food and drink vendors.\nThe hall of fame should be something physical like other ball parks with statues and plaques. \nWalls are boring.",

          "Clean, well maintained stadium, but be careful where you sit! There are a couple areas, where you can't see the whole field, annoying blind spots! They were more interested on looking neat, when they remodeled the place, after the earthquake!! Place has extremely polite, helpful ushers, & staff! Now to find some good pitchers??",
          "Had a great time and we hope to come back again soon. I'm not an Angels fan but the atmosphere was fun and inviting. Lots of traffic was the only downside.",
          "It was my first time at the stadium for the Foam and Glow 5K run. It was a great concept and the music was fun... the only down fall was to start the race it took a while and kids were getting little cranky. Over all good experience, would like to see a baseball game one day.",

          "I love the big A! The staff is always very nice and although the stadium itself is kind of old it's still pretty damn cool. Big shout-out to Mike who runs the Corona stand on the 3rd Base side, he's one of the finest employees you folks have.",
          "Love a good baseball game. The crowd could be more into the game but we are not doing too hot right now. Food is good. Helmet nachos are the best.",

          "The warm summer evenings watching Mike Trout & Shohei Ohtani will be something I will tell my future kids about. Nice ballpark for the age. The rocks in CF and the big halo are a nice touch. Definitely wish they had more food options but the guests, employees, and atmosphere is wonderful.",
          "It was accommodating but it would have been nicer if the concession stands were open. We walked out of the stadium to go eat lunch. Just as many many other people did.

          "Like the big A. Great place for a ball game",
          "We sat row 3 behind first base. Heads up are for sure. Lots of fast fouls and pops in our area. Little too hot for my taste, but the seats were great for the view of the game.",
          "Had an ok time. A person behind me would not keep quiet. It was a voice that carried. I'm all for talking but non stop. Not one minute passed where there was silence. Was some good action. A person got kicked out for throwing a beer. The \u2026",
          "Love the stadium of the Angel's best experience ever!!!",
          "Great stadium, an array of food and drink available at every level. Loved the Diamond club seats and service!",
          "Definitely not my favorite ballpark. It\u2019s very clean and food choices are okay The security and ushers need to tone it down a bit. The churros guy was making obscene gestures \ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd2b. Plenty of Parking. I usually go here once a year, so I\u2019ll be back.",

          "Loved watching my son Chaz McWilliams pitch there!",
          "This stadium is one of the older ones in the league but it has aged well. My biggest complaint would be the club level area, if I'm going to pay extra to sit there, their should be much better food options. Your only choices are hot dogs or have something delivered to your seat.",

          "Nice stadium, but man the fans were dead. Not much noise.",

We have a great time everytime we go and the food court has some really great items like sushi burritos!!",
          "Sat in the Lexus Diamond Club with a crew of guys from Switzerland. Their expressions made my night! They've never had chicken and waffles. Looks like they are going home with new recipes. As far as Monster Jam goes, they were speechless.",

        "wiki": "Adventure City is an amusement park in Stanton, California, United States. Occupying an area of over 2 acres (0.81 ha), Adventure City is one of the smallest theme parks in California, and receives an average attendance of between 200,000 and 400,000 per year. The Coca-Cola Company is the park's only major sponsor. The park sits right on the edge of Anaheim and Stanton. Though the park advertises itself as being within the city of Anaheim, the physical location of the park is in Stanton while the parking lot and main entrance are in Anaheim.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park opened in 1994 at a cost of $4 million, as an expansion of Hobby City, a nearby 6-acre (2.4 ha) collection of novelty shops and museums. The park was initially marketed for families with children, as an affordable alternative to other California amusement parks such as Disneyland in Anaheim, Six Flags Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita, Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park and Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City. Hobby City's original miniature railroad attraction, which opened in 1938 (25 years before the park opened), was extended and incorporated into the new park. A classic 1946 carousel was also part of the parks opening day attractions roster.In 1999, the park purchased and refurbished a classic 1950s-era Wild Mouse style rollercoaster from an amusement company in Brisbane, Australia. The park named its new roller coaster Tree Top Racers, and expanded its boundaries westward into an adjacent former parking area to incorporate its new attraction. The ride was the park's first new attraction since opening, adding to its collection of classic rides. In 2012, Tree Top Racers was permanently closed.\nIn 2005, the park opened Drop Zone, its second new attraction since opening day, next to Tree Top Racers. In 2015, Rewind Racers, a $2 million family shuttle coaster opened on the former site of Tree Top Racers in time for the park's 20th anniversary. The ride is a first of its kind attraction in North America, built by Gerstlauer, a German ride manufacturer, and the largest single investment in the park's history.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Rides ===\nBalloon Race - Spinning balloon ride.\nBarnstormer Planes - Spinning airplane ride.\nDrop Zone - Opened in 2005, a drop tower ride.\nFreeway Coaster - The park's first roller coaster. It was built around a giant pepper tree[8] which existed on the site before the park was built.\nCrank 'n' Roll - Kid-powered 'train' ride.\nAdventure City Express Train - A 14 in (356 mm) gauge[9] ridable miniature train ride built in 1938 and was a main attraction at Hobby *City for 25 years. It was incorporated into the park when the park was built in 1994.\nCrazy Bus - A bus-themed flat ride\nCarousel - A vintage 1946 carousel featuring 20 horse figures.\nGiggle Wheel - A mini Ferris wheel.\nRewind Racers - Opened in 2015. A unique family shuttle coaster. A first of its kind in North America.\nRescue Ride - 6 individual rescue vehicles that travel around a serpentine track\n\n\n=== Other attractions ===\nChildren's theater - Outdoor theater showing educational presentations including puppet shows and live shows.\nPetting farm\nThomas and Friends - An area where children can play with toys and train sets from the Thomas and Friends franchise.\nMount Adventurous - A children's rock climbing tower.\nArcade\n\n\n=== Former attractions ===\nTree Top Racers - Opened in 1999, a 1950s-era vintage Wild Mouse roller coaster. The ride closed in 2012 and was replaced in 2015 by Rewind Racers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAdventure City at the Roller Coaster DataBase",

          "A nice clean park with nice employees. Definitely not for teenagers, but they would still enjoy some rides. The lines are not long and your small children can go on their favorite rides again and again. Plenty of shaded ares for adults to sit down. Our two grandsons (4 & 7)",
          "I will first say for the above - type of visit didn't include the proper entry so I marked family with teens but it was mother with adult son; therefore, family is appropriate. It was a good decision to take my adult son with autism there for his birthday. He is of short",

          "Let me preface this by saying that I have not been to Adventure City in over 8 years, however, when we did visit, our children were 10, 8 and 3. It was a great alternative for a family, who at the time did not have the means to take their children to the more larger theme parks",

          "We had a relax day and the kids got bored, so we found this park and thought it looked like fun. It was awesome. My 3 year old was able to do almost everything, and we were able to go on the rides over and over again. My 9 year old had a great time on the faster roller coaster",

          "Have you ever taken your young child to Disneyland just to hear them complain and say they want to go home? You just spent a small fortune to take them there and now you have to deal with it for the rest of the day. Come to Adventure City where a family of five can get in for",

          "We were looking for a special outing over the weekend and we happened upon this place on yelp. We don't live too far away but never even knew about it! Yes, its affordable but its also tiny so the price reflects the size. I have a 5 and a 2yo and, with the 4 of us, we were there",
          "A very small theme park for kids where they can experience the rides meant for adults in other parts. Always less crowded and easy to walk from end to end. If your kids are lazy and do not want like rides then avoid else its a must have for small kids who are not allowed rides",

          "We love Adventure City! It is a great place for children up to 9 or 10 years of age. Our most recent visit was on Easter Day with our 6 year old twin grandchildren. When we arrived, there was a puppet type show going on so we stopped and watched it. The kids stayed",
          "This was our second time coming here. The kids love this place (ages under 10). We were hoping the new roller coaster would be up and running but it was still being tested otherwise a great day. This place is inexpensive compared to Knotts Berry Farm and Disney and everything",
          "This is a great place to take your kids. They were able to ride everything with a breeze. Even though it's a small place it seems like your at a big amusement park. You can't beat the price $17 and you ride everything except rock wall. Prices are decent and I was very amused.",
          "This is a great park to visit for those folks who are on a budget and/or want to avoid the throngs at Disney. However, two points to keep in mind: 1. Go as early as you can, as crowds start to get thick around lunchtime and early afternoon. 2. Because the admission prices here",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Oak Canyon Nature Center is a nature preserve located in Anaheim, Southern California. Owned by the city, the park spans an area of 58-acres (23 hectares), comprising three adjoining canyons of the Santa Ana foothills. It has an elevation range from 525 to 825 feet (160 to 251 m)., and contains three major vegetation zones: coastal sage scrub, oak woodland and riparian. Open on weekends, the John J. Collier Interpretive Center features a museum with live animal and regional natural history exhibits.\nThe center offers nature education programs and summer camp programs.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Precipitation ===\nThe annual precipitation average 15 inches (38 cm) per rainfall year (July 1 to June 30) within a 20-year period between 1982 and 2002. Most of the precipitation occurs during the November\u2013April rainy season.\n\n\n=== Vegetation ===\nThe Oak Canyon ridge is covered in oak woodland on its northern side and coastal sage scrub habitat on its southern side. Due to the slope effect, the southern slope of the ridge is exposed to direct solar radiation. The consequent higher rate of evapotranspiration creates a dry, warm environment that favors drought-tolerant deciduous shrubs and herb. The exposed slope also favors low-growing plants with small leaves to avoid wind shear damage. Characteristic shrubs on the south slope include: California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), and California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).The north-facing slope of the canyon is shaded from the Sun's direct impact. The cooler environment has enough moisture to support dense oak woodland. The most commonly encountered trees are California live oak (Quercus agrifolia), California black walnut (Juglans californica) and western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum).\nAt the park's lower elevation, a year-round stream runs along the canyon foothill. The western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Wood duck (Aix sponsa) are restricted in range to this riparian habitat.\n\n\n=== Soil characteristics ===\nThe soil on the southern slope consists of coarse sand and gravel. The poor water-retaining ability of this soil contributes to the dominance of drought-tolerant scrubs and pyrophyte plants. These xerophytes have shallow but extensive root network to rapidly absorb water from the soil.The soil from the north-facing slope is covered by a thick layer of leaf litter. This organic layer allows water retention by the soil and supports the growth of larger trees species.  As the result, oak and other broadleaf outcompete scrubs on the north-facing slope.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nOver 4 miles (6 km) of trails are available to hikers The trails range from flat to moderate incline. A typical trail is 0.3 mile (0.5 km) in length with partial shade at lower elevation and full sun along the ridge's top.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOak Canyon Nature Center - City of Anaheim",

        "wiki": "The Honda Center (formerly known as the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim) is an indoor arena located in Anaheim, California. The arena is home to the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League.\nOriginally named the Anaheim Arena during construction, it was completed in 1993 at a cost of US$123 million. Arrowhead Water paid $15 million for the naming rights over 10 years in October 1993. In the short period of time between the enfranchisement of the Mighty Ducks and the naming rights deal with Arrowhead, Disney referred to the Arena as the Pond of Anaheim. In October 2006, Honda paid $60 million for the naming rights over 15 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n \n \n \n  \nThe arena opened on June 19, 1993, with a Barry Manilow concert as its first event. Since then, it has been host to a number of events, such as the 2003 and 2007 Stanley Cup Finals. On June 6, 2007, the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Ottawa Senators, 6\u20132, in game five of the Final at Honda Center to clinch the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.Honda Center has hosted several UFC events, starting with UFC 59 in 2006. It hosted the 2005 IBF World Championships for badminton in 2005.From 1994 to 1999, it served as a second home for the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. It was the home arena for the Anaheim Bullfrogs of Roller Hockey International from 1994 to 1999 and for the Anaheim Piranhas of the Arena Football League from 1996 to 1997.This arena has also hosted a PBR Bud Light Cup (later Built Ford Tough Series) event annually since 1998. Since 1994, the arena has hosted the annual Wooden Legacy basketball tournament.In 2011, the arena began hosting the Big West Conference Men's and Women's Basketball tournaments. The arena has also hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament seven times, as the West Regional site \u2013 1998, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2019. It even hosted the Frozen Four, the semifinals and final of the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship, in 1999, underscoring the popularity of hockey in the region.On December 6, 2000, music legend Tina Turner played her last concert at the arena for the record breaking Twenty Four Seven Tour, but after popular demand, Turner returned to the arena before a sellout crowd on October 14, 2008, for her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour.\nThe Honda Center lies northeast across California State Route 57 from Angel Stadium (the home stadium of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels) and roughly 3 miles (4.8 km) from Disneyland Park. It is also across the street from Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center with service by Amtrak (Pacific Surfliner), Metrolink (Orange County Line), Anaheim Resort Transit, Orange County Transportation Authority and private transportation companies.\nThe arena seats up to 17,174 for its primary tenant, the Ducks. It takes only five hours to convert Honda Center from a sporting arena to an 8,400-seat amphitheater. There are 84 luxury suites in the building, which has hosted 17.5 million people, as of 2003. In 2005, the arena became the first in the U.S. to have two full levels of 360\u00b0 ribbon displays installed. Daktronics of Brookings, South Dakota, designed, manufactured and installed the 1,800 feet (550 m) of full-color LED technology. Outside the venue, the marquee was upgraded with two large video displays measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) high by 21 feet (6.4 m), and a new marquee was built with more LED video displays.Broadcom chairman Henry Samueli owns the company that operates the arena, Anaheim Arena Management, LLC, and the arena's primary tenant, the Ducks, giving him great flexibility in scheduling events and recruiting new tenants. Samueli hopes to bring an NBA team to the arena. In 2015, Samueli purchased the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League and, with the AHL incarnation of the Admirals, relocating to San Diego to become the reactivated San Diego Gulls. During the 2014\u20132015 NHL Season, it was announced that Honda Center would get a new scoreboard that will replace the one that was in place since its opening in 1993. The new scoreboard made its debut in a Ducks pre-season game against the Los Angeles Kings.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n=== Ice Hockey ===\nGames 3, 4, and 6 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals\nGames 1, 2, and 5 of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals\n\n\n=== MMA & Pro Wrestling ===\nAffliction: Banned was held in the Honda Center.\nUFC 59, UFC 63, UFC 76, UFC 121, UFC on Fox 1, UFC 157, UFC 214 and UFC 241 were held in the Honda Center.\nThe arena has hosted Bellator 160.\nThe arena has hosted a number of WWE events including WrestleMania XII, Royal Rumble 1999, WrestleMania 2000, as well as various episodes of Monday Night Raw and SmackDown.\n\n\n=== Concerts ===\nHonda Center has the second highest gross ticket sales from special events on the West Coast, following only Staples Center.

          "It's a solid arena for a sports event but the food is very low quality and extremely overpriced, even by arena standards. I get that arenas jack up their prices but what the Honda Center does is far worse than any other I've been to, especially because the food you get is such",

          "Great if you\u2019re in the $110 seats, which is what I recommend if you\u2019re a senior or better. It\u2019s a great venue for the hockey game.

          "This arena is very well staffed with friendly and knowlegeable people. Great variety of food. Only negative is how close the rows are to each other.",
          "I'm not sure what place some of these reviewers were visiting but I think they may be the promotional team for the Staples Center. This venue was miles ahead of the Staples Center. Had much more class and certainly a more modern look. ...and no McDonalds! We were visiting to",

          "The Honda Center feels more like an upscale mall than a sports venue. That is not a bad thing, but it is a little unexpected. The sight lines are good and the home crowds are mellow. The food options are fine. The Lakers play one preseason game per year and it is shame that",
          "This place has to have the WORST acoustics of any \"musical\" venue I have ever been. The date below of Sept. 2017 is not accurate. It was even before that and for music - haven't been back since. For the cost of the Concerts?? No way!",

          "Great acoustics inside and plenty of space in the lobby. Super clean and shiny. (including restrooms)",
          "The home of the Anaheim Ducks is a really great hockey venue. It's modern and has the normal security restrictions you find at any gathering place, but the best aspect is that you have a pretty good view of the action from wherever your seat may be. Closer is better, of course,",

          "Compared to the saddledome in Calgary the Honda Center almost $7 for RC Cola. Beer $14 bucks a drink and food is double the price of the Saddledome. The stadium looks great it looked like a nice hotel",
          "Went to see a Anaheim Ducks NHL game here recently and it was great. The venue was easy to access and we had great seats. Refer the Honda Center website, for restrictions on what you can actually bring for entry. There is a designated Uber pick up and drop off point which",
          "Invited by business partners to be their guests in a suite for a concert. NICE! It was cold outside. We waited in line outside for the doors to open. After a bit a venue staffer went through the lines asking for guests in our section. We were then escorted to a side/private",

          "The Honda Center is beautiful. We went to a Hockey game (Ducks vs Oilers). Aside from the game being great. The facility looks brand new. Things are overpriced, but why should you expect anything different being located right next to Disneyland. I would probably enjoy any event",

          "Parking crazy! But A fantastic night of fun. Great Concert! Seating was great, but the sound system was muffled somewhat, probably because of the vast arena. Drinks were way overpriced! Water $5.50 and $12 cups of beer, but Garth made up for it in fun and song. Wish Trisha had",

          "Great hockey arena @Stanley Cup 1st Round. Parking is a bit of a hassle with the traffic on a SoCal Saturday around 5 p.m., therefore took a nice walk from the Anaheim Garden Walk, ~3 miles. You just cannot beat the excitement of the NHL playoffs--glass seats 5 rows behind the",
          "The Venue: There are a few entrance to enter the venue which is good to spread out the crowd. There are many food vendors selling food & drinks. They do have cup holder at every seat. The venue is considered small compared to Staple Center & Microsoft Theater. It is good if",

          "Everything about the stadium was great except for the prices of food. I know that food will always be expensive at sporting events but the prices here took to a new level I had never seen before. The stadium is all up to date though, the seats were actually comfortable and even",
          "A great venue. Have been to a number of rinks, and this one feels cosy and packed! Didn't feel over crowded, and the parking was pretty good. Even better, the Jet's beat the Duck's in OT! Yes, I AM CANADIAN.... :)",
          "Very impressive facility. Staff was very helpful. Fans were friendly to me, my wife and my daughter, even with our Winnipeg Jets jersey's on! Thanks Duck's fans, seeing as the Jets are not in the playoffs, I hope you win the cup this year. Good to see another 40 or 50 Jet fans",

          "we were there for the NCAA Sweet Sixteen games. I am rating the Honda Center as poor because of the parking. they parked us in a business area across from the stadium. I am not sure what was going on but they could not handle getting people into the parking. It took almost an",
          "We visited for the first time, for the NCAA b-ball tourney. The arena is nice, but a bit dated. Our seats were dirty, upholstered folding chairs, obviously brought in for extra seating. Kind of weird and not very comfortable. The best thing about the arena is the intermodal",

          "While visiting Anaheim, my husband and I came to a Ducks game. He's a huge hockey fan and likes to visit hockey arenas around the country. This arena was very nice! We were on the upper level which was a little steep for me (but I'm afraid of heights). We did have a nice view.",

          "I attended the Ducks/NY Ranger game on the 16th. From beginning to end I enjoyed this place immensely. Being a die hard Ranger fan, I was a little concerned about wearing my colors, fear NOT! These fans and entire Honda Center staff were fantastic. We had a lovely time",

          "My family and I attended a CIF basketball tournament last weekend and enjoyed visiting the Honda Center. I was living in Anaheim when it was built and a state of the art facility. That was MANY years ago. The complaints are common among these types of stadium: Not enough",
          "The Anaheim Ducks played host to the montreal Canadiens and what a scrappy game it was. Going on to overtime and then a shoutout which sadly had the Ducks win. Fantastic, friendly and helpful staff and a great atmosphere overall. Well worth a visit if in Anaheim.",

          "Went and watched the Ducks play a game of hockey which for Australians is something very new. Although I have seen a game prior it was a first for my children and they loved it. The Honda Center is huge and driving to it and parking around was very easy to do. Once inside there",
          "We went to an Anaheim Ducks hockey game and were impressed with how easy it was to drive there from Disneyland and how easy it was to park, as well. Cost is $16. The venue is awesome, selection and food is good, and the crowd is friendly...unlike the LA Kings game that we went",
          "I have been to this arena on numerous occasions for hockey, basketball, concerts, conventions, etc. The venue is spacious and clean. My only complaint is the parking. Smaller events are OK but they cannot accommodate larger events well. Parking outside the stadium is a real pain.",
          "Went and saw the Dicks v Wild and enjoyed the facilities. Parking was a breeze if not a bit expensive. The quality of the food from the stands was good and easily accessible on all levels. The staff were always on hand to guide and were friendly. Seating was great and viewing",
          "If your from out of state as we are Wild fans. This is a great place to check out a game. While in Minnesota you will pay top dollar for a ticket, here they were cheap. The same price we pay for upper level at the Excel center got us row g beside the Wild bench.",

          "Old arena, not too big but quite cosi with plenty of beverage options. Game was great and despite having a far back seat, view was great. Taxis easy to find after the game. Great to watch a hockey game but then go home since there is not left much to offer in this stadium.",
          "We went to a ducks game and it was awesome. It was our first NHL game ever and we sat pretty high up but it was still very good and it's definitely worth going on a game there. Pretty cheap as well if you sitting high up!",

          "I went there last month, to attend my first hockey on ice play (Anaheim vs. Pittburgh). All I can say, it was one of the highlights of my trip. The stadium is spacious, full of life and it was not that so far away from my hotel. It is also very secure. The memorabilia store was",

          "Took the Grandkids to see Frozen. The parking was OK but the cost was outrageous and the fact they do not take credit or debit cards is not convinent. Also the lighting both inside and out seemed dim so not impressive. The staff was mediocre at best. For the prices charged it",

          "My wife and I went to a game here as part of a West Coast road trip following the Pittsburgh Penguins. The arena was very accessible and we had great seats at center ice. The sight-lines and lighting seemed somewhat off and the atmosphere from the crowd wasn't what we had",
          "Paid $16 for parking, general parking, $20 for vip. Bought tickets there. Cheaper than ticketmaster. Waited in a line for them to open the doors. They open 1 hour before the show starts. We finally get to go in. Plenty of bathrooms on each level. Food places. Not all were open",

          "I've been to the Honda Center twice recently - to see Foo Fighters (awesome show) and the Dalai Lama (wasn't what I expected). Both events provided great site lines and excellent acoustics. Parking, as with all stadium-type events, is a ample, but getting out requires patience,",
          "We had a fantastic experience touring the Honda Event Center by GM , this place is very, very nice! The food and service was impressive as well. Meeting Gene Simmons & Paul Stanley was a once in a lifetime experience and talking with them before the game in the private suite",
          "Honda center is the perfect venue to watch a concert , Anaheim Ducks hockey or Barnam and Bailyes circus. Every seat you have a good view of the floor. The stairs are steep and high allowing everybody a decent view .",
          "Nice arena for ice hockey. Clean and comfortable, with a mild mannered but mostly benign crowd. It is smaller than Staples Center with slightly dimmer lighting, but overall is a still a more pleasant experience.",
          "Need to exchange tickets for wheelchair accessibility. Box office says there are none sold out. They offered a refund.. So I had to argue with them if I fall trying to climb your stairs because you can't accommodate me I'm going to sue this place!!! And of course all of a sudden",
          "Went to a Ducks hockey game, and didn't see anything on the website about not being able to bring a backpack. Got all the way to the gate, and was told that we had to go all the way back to the car because we couldn't bring it in. Not sure why you can't bring a backpack even",
          "I literally could go on and on about how awful my experience at the Honda Center was for a concert that I attended in October. The staff were so rude. We were queueing in line since 6:00 am for a concert that started at 8:00pm that day. The security staff shoved everyone in",
          "We came for a concert with foo fighters and gary clark jr. Great show with decent sound and lighting. Very good place for concerts with one exception...No food, no drinks, no water, no no no down on the floor which is covered with thick plywood or something. That takes it",

          "I've seen quite a few shows here, as well as seeing some good Hockey games, and it is really a nice place. It's closely nearby Disneyland, but you've really gotta be careful with parking. Its a zoo once games and events let out, so you may be stuck in your car for awhile. Great",
          "saw a concert here. There wasn't a bad seat! Plenty of options for food and beverage. There are many entrances so it is important to find the right one. The ticket takers will not let you in the wrong entrance, you could walk around the entire arena.",

          "I finally got the chance to catch a Ducks game there and it was a pretty cool experience. The fans were definitely more knowledgeable then I thought they would be which enhanced our game experience. I'm not a big fan of their Mascot Wild Wing though as I think it's too much",
          "Its easy to find this location just off the 55 fwy. Been here to watch concerts, shows in the past. Not hard to get a parking space, and walk from the parking is not hard. Seating is ok, I guess you have to pay more if you want a perfect view.",
          "Went to a hockey game here. Actually drove 10 hours to attend. The arena itself was ok. It is small so you can see great from any seat. The seats are TINY...I mean TINY. Everyone was uncomfortable and the arms do not rise so literally every time you get up to cheer you have to",

          "Went to a Ducks game vs. Arizona back in November. The arena grounds are nicely maintained and the concourses inside are decorated nicely with Ducks art and photography, and there is a good amount of space to move around during high traffic times. The food is some of the best",

          "I took my kids to their first concert at the Honda Center. Overall a great experience. There was police directing traffic at every turn, cones and traffic patterns so you couldn't go wrong. And that was before we even got in the venue. Once inside, the place was amazing, clean",
          "The grounds and exterior of the arena was very nice. There were definitely more New York fans than duck fans there, and considering the ducks were first in the league I would've thought the fans would be more into the game. Most of them left halfway through the third when the",

          "I am no stadium connoisseur, but the Honda Center has a nice family atmosphere though it's showing its age a bit. The hometown fans were nice. The arena also provided some space out front for team booths and related activities for kid-friendly fun. Parking was pretty easy on",
          "A group of us went to the Pittsburgh/Anaheim hockey game this past Friday evening and had a wonderful time. The arena is definitely older than others but it serves it's purpose well. We had seats at 442 (nose bleeds - I know) but I think we had some good seats. A lot of people",

          "We came to the Honda Center for the very first time to see the Anaheim Ducks retire Teemu Selanne's #8. The facility was fantastic, as they've recently renovated many of the concessions, and halls. The seating is great too, a testament to that early 90's building fad, where",
          "Being from Australia , i have never seen an ice hockey game. WOW! These guys fly around the arena. It is an exciting fast paced sport. I now follow the Anaheim Ducks. Its nothing but action pack entertainment. The music is full on.It goes crazy with sirens, music and the crowd",
          "Such a great place. The best hockey games are here. Great sound systems and the glass is always clean. Seats and floors are well kept. Don't get me wrong, after a game it amazes me how messy people get. They throw drinks around, trash on the floors and the parking lots get",
          "We saw the Ducks vs. Sharks game with great seats priced incomparably cheaper than back home (Toronto). If you like sporting events, this is not to be missed. The singer for the national anthem was outstanding, there were giveaways all night and the best part: a waiter came",

          "Definitely if you're in Anaheim, catch an Anaheim ducks game! The atmosphere is awesome and definitely an experience!",
          "Easy to get to and easy to get back to Anaheim. No matter where you sit for an Ice Hockey Game the view is great (much better than Madison Square Garden - in my opinion)",
          "It really is worth the price of admission to hear Ducks fans yell in horror, when they see their goalie being pulled on delayed penalties for the extra attacker. They mean well but some of them are very new to the game. Fans are nice though, as long as their team is winning.",

          "I've been a Ducks hockey fan for many years so I must tell you and Honda Center management that they made the worse decisions ever in their choice of restaurants. The restaurant venues are mediocre at best and very expensive for the quality of food. The new Standing O",
          "If you cheering against the ducks be prepared to be ripped apart by security. You can't have backpacks, be aware of the camera you bring it in- it can't have a certain lens. It took us twenty minutes just to get into the stadium. Once in there the fans are great and the arena is",

          "You need to take a taxi or drive you own car to get there ( public transportation is very bad in and around LA ). Because the stadium is only used for ice hockey?, it has a different kind of architecture and the atmosphere is intimate ( most people concentrating on ice hockey",
          "We went to watch the Lakers play the Jazz. What a thrill to watch these athletes up so close! The venue and the atmosphere were amazing and we had great seats. The \"kiss cam\" and all the \"American\" food that we wanted to experience didn't disappoint.",
          "I love all of the new changes to the Honda Center. There's the new restaurant out front & better food consessions both on the lower level & mezzanine level. The security checks are quick & the lines move very quickly. I've been going there since it opened & it just keeps getting",
          "Easy access in & out. It's worth paying for Preferred Parking as you literally can park at the entrance. It's also worth paying for club seats or better. Try the turkey burger - delicious. The pulled chicken - not very good. Great service at the seats & not overcrowded at the",
          "The Honda Center is a first rate venue. Unlike other centers I've visited where you have to wait in long lines to enter the venue, there was no wait to get into the center even though it was a packed event. Better yet, everyone we came across, from the security staff outside the",

          "Well organized, parking worked efficiently, nice restrooms, comfortable seating, and excellent sound system.",
          "Went to Honda Stadium to see the Eagles. Great show and an awesome arena to be in. Would love to go again and watch the ice hockey normally played here. Good facilities and parking. Traffic slow on exit but you expect that",
          "Saw the \"Eagles\" on October 3 with seats in the upper tier. Seats were fine and engineered that gave you an unobstructed view. A pleasant experience and my first time here. The only comment is the traffic congestion. Driving to the event to be dropped off took an excessive",
          "The seats are not comfortable, especially in the \"nosebleed\" section. There are large built in cup holders that make the armrest uncomfortable. If you have long legs like my husband does, your knees are close to the seat in front. But the excitement of the concerts or whoever",
          "Arrived late due to delayed flight. The staff was very helpful, got me a wheelchair immediately, as our section of on the ground floor and i cannot descend or ascend stairs. The staff was right a my seat at the end of the performance to wheel me out to the curb.",

          "Travelling to the centre from LA took longer than I expected as traffic on the I5 is really quite heavy so leave plenty of time. Parking is on site, so no worries there if you arrive in good time and have $16 to hand. The CENTER is state of the art, steeply pitched so the view",
          "I can't find The Grand Terrace listed as a restaurant here on Tripadvisor, but I do want to review it for a couple of reasons. First of all, as far as a pre-show dinner goes, my hubby and I ate in the restaurant, at the bar, and both the food was way better than either of us",
          "Holy cow...the seats are so narrow!! Even my smaller framed friend was wedged in tight. Also, the upper level is super steep, so beware if you are afraid of heights. Staff is nice and the place is clean...if you can get out of your seat to enjoy it.",
          "We took a shuttle from our hotel to the Honda Centre - public transport really doesn't seem to match up very well with events being held at the sporting venues. Had a wonderful meal after the game across the road - don't have the name at hand but the food and atmosphere there",
          "Went there for WWE Monday Night Raw. Honda Centre was well oranised with food drinks and merchandise. Staff were very helpful in locating my seat. After event was easy to exit the building",

          "What a wonderful concert. I have never been to the Honda Center and the acoustics were great. We got the tickets for $25.00 each. Even though, they had screens around, next time, I will try to get seats closer. Loved his singing and talking to us. Had dinner across the",
          "Nice clean facility with great crowd control. Easy in and out and food tasty but pricey as customary for these places but more variety than usual. Saw Lionel Richie, the acoustics were great. Great performer in a great place!",

          "Great show and my family got to meet all the Olympic skaters... Great seats for the price. Like any large venue, it's pricy to purchase food, drinks and souvenirs. Security staff were gracious and accommodating.",
          "We go here all the time to see our favorite artists, sports team, and special events. There is plenty of easily accessible parking, and the traffic control around the area is phenomenal. The best time can be had by renting a suite. They don't cost much more that the regular",
          "We attended a Chicago Blackhawk vs. Anaheim Ducks game in Feb. 2014. We've been to many arenas and they all seem to be generic in their game presentations, game entertainment, music and the like and this one was no different. The game was good if that matters. This has to be",
          "Came to see the Ducks play. It was the second game I have seen in the \"Pond\" and both times I've had a good time. It is my opinion that there is not a bad seat in the house. As far as hockey goes, this is a great place to come see a game. Lot's of food to choose from and",
          "I have season tickets for the Ducks and enjoy the Honda Center. It's small enough to not cause a huge ruckous to get in and out quickly and they've just added on a huge terrace area this season. I've also seen UFC and a few concerts here. I haven't had a bad seat to anything.",
          "The Honda Center is a descent place to attend concerts. It is clean and the staff is usually pretty friendly. I do not like arena or stadium concerts at all, however to see certain bands it is the only option. The prices for the best seats also vary with the band performing as",

          "For a sports arena, I was impressed at how clean and shiny it was! We attended a hockey game on this occasion and the personnel on hand were extremely helpful in assisting with finding our seats, other questions, etc. It appeared that just about all the seats had good views",

          "Great place to see a game. Attendants are helpful and friendly and the players are too. Seems they're glad to be playing hockey in sunny California instead of snowy Manitoba. Plenty of parking and good access and egress to the venue. Nice crowd (it definitely ain't Philly!).",
          "What an organized, clean and accommodating stadium. From entry to concession stand to seating, it all hummed along. Truly a world class venue. Getting there may be an exercise in patience as traffic around the area on event night is heavy. PS.. Habs won in an overtime",
          "Went there for a Concert and it is a great venue. Had floor seats, but might do lower seating area instead next time. Being on the floor made it a little more difficult to see the stage. I think the lower seating closer to the stage would be better.",

          "I have seen several events at this venue and all were quite enjoyable. I have seen the Ducks play Hockey, The Ringling Bros Barnum & Bailey Circus and several concerts including Paul McCartney. This venue is big enough for a big show but it still feels intimate and small enough",
          "We stopped by Honda Center for a Ducks game. We love the team and the coach! The arena was OK. We sat on the club level and had waiters walking in front of us all game ( interesting because they make fans wait for a whistle). The Ducks fans are quiet, don't cheer much, and there",
          "Made a last minute trip to see the Ducks for our first NHL game. The venue is easy to travel to, right off the freeway and parking was orderly. Parking is located across the street and costs $15. Security is a little tighter than I was used to upon entering, using metal",

          "I went there some weeks ago to watch my ever first hockey game. I don't need to say that much, it was awesome! Great team, great fans, great atmosphere. Probably a more interesting game than football (soccer) is. Its a really nice stadium btw but you should visit it to watch a",
          "My family and I had gotten tickets as a gift. We had a blast! Not a bad seat in the house really. Be sure to dress warm. The only draw back was the expensive food, drinks, and snacks! Oh my! Now I am sure this is how they make their money but boy was it expensive! I'd suggest",

          "It was easy to get tickets online - and every seat has a great view. Of course expect stadium pricing for food and drinks. Hallways are small and you would never know that you're in a hockey arena as it's quite opulent. Lots of parking and attendants organized to get you in and",
          "Great concert and the Honda center is a very nice lace to see sporting events and concerts. Food and beverages are too expensive. The Honda Center is very clean. Parking is difficult to get in and out of so arrive early.",
          "Great sight lines all round this arena. We were in the upper tier for the first of three Ducks games and could see everything. We moved down to the lower bowl for the later 2 games and the view was even better. Plenty of restrooms, food outlets and merchandise stalls. Parking",
          "While on vacation, we decided to attend a Ducks hockey game. Staff was very nice and helpful and the line moved quickly to get into the Center. Although our seats were pretty high up, the view of the action was perfect! My only complaint is that the cab area is not clearly",
          "Great for sports but lousy acoustics for music. Don't sit up high. Seat close to stage on upper levels get terrible echo",
          "PROS: -Convenient parking, as far as arenas are concerned. -Good security. -Good air flow(AC). Not too sweaty, as some arenas tend to get. CONS: -Tiny, narrow chairs. Very uncomfortable seating. -Rip-off concessions.",
          "We were recently here to attend a benefit concert. Upon arrival at the door the staff were rude. I attempted to enter a door and the staff member said \"go over there\" to stand behind my husband who was being checked prior to going through the doorway. Then I went behind him",
          "I doubt I would ever come to this arena again....worst I have ever been and rude security besides. I had seats in the \"nosebleed\" section but wasn't worried because I figured the event would be projected. Nope. Ok...so not to worry, could still hear...sort of. The acoustics",

          "Saw Fleetwood Mac back in May. I liked the Honda Center. It is a smaller venue then Staple Center and was MUCH easier to park and to get out after the concert. Now we paid the extra money to park right across the street and when we left it was very organized in regard to",
          "Though parking was ridicuously expensive in my opinion the venue itself was easy to navigate and a great place for a concert.",
          "The venue was a typical stadium, long lines for restrooms, food, and over an hour line for souvenirs. Seating was cramped and uncomfortable but we stood the whole time anyway. The show started an hour late but it was the Rolling Stones so they're forgiven. Parking was mildly",
          "Sound great at the Honda Center when we attended the Rolling Stones concert! Easy to get in to the facility and we took a cab. Not a long wait in the line for entry or drinks or rest rooms. Friendly staff and security was very helpful and friendly. We had floor seats in the",
          "We had a grrreat time here. It was NHL playoffs. We lucked out, it was very reasonably priced. I would recommend taking a cab, as we ended up doing. They give door to door service. Being from Michigan we were able to watch our Wings win this leg of the playoffs and move on to",
          "Been for a Rod Stewart concert and for bullriding too. Not too bad of a location - restaurants and plenty of hotels not too far away.",
          "This is a beautiful venue, very upscale. Many events to pick from but if you like the performers, this is a great place to see them. Plenty of paid parking but you can be dropped off and park 1/2 mi away in an industrial park.",
          "Went to see The Anaheim Ducks v The Oilers Ice Hockey. Very good venue, if a little confusing as to which entry point we needed, we virtually walked around the whole building. Staff were friendly, security is thorough. Good choice of snacks available.",
          "The staff and ushers were very friendly to my family here. Was one of the first hockey games for my children and they really enjoyed the experience. Was helpful the Ducks won the game also. A nice diversion from just going to Disney when visiting Anaheim.",
          "Right opposite the hotel we stayed in. This looked purpose built for large events very strategically located and quite imposing too. Right on Katella Avenue,it is not difficult to locate at all!",

          "Watched the Ducks and had pre-booked tixs so all easy there. Ended up getting a car to pick up the 7 of us and collect post game which cost $50 but was worth it as traffic post game seemed crazy. Seats really narrow - lost one beer when my 12 year old clipped the cup holder.",
          "Very well laid out facility. It was very easy to find our way around and the signs were located in areas that made it easy for even our kids to find their way. Lots of food venue options which was nice. Bathroom layout was a little confusing. It was really hard to figure out",
          "The Ducks organization does it right. The arena is beautiful and located in a great, safe location. I was a neutral fan attending the game and enjoyed it very much.",
          "Love going here and seeing Disney on ice. There are no bad seats at the Honda Center. I have seen hockey and also enjoyed music concerts here in the past. Food is pricey but the place is fun.",
          "Beware, most low level seats sell out fast! We were only able to buy HIGH seat tickets, too high for me, afraid of height, so I ended up watching the game on TV in the lobby area. The stadium is HUGE and almost every seat sold out so there is no moving lower though the kind",
          "What a great venue! Ordered tickets online, a package deal, seats in the end section right about the goal line, and two hot dogs/pops. Picked up my tickets at the Will Call, it's on the South side of the arena. Not used to the security search ( Canadian eh) but they were very",
          "We took a cab from the hotel (near the convention center) - about $13.00 each way. The Center was clean, the staff was helpful (our first time there) and the food was quite good! There's a special area for taxi pick-up so you are out of there real fast! A BIG plus! Ducks won,",
          "Went to our first even NHL game here so may be a bit biased but it was a really good venue. Sat on the goal line about 8-12 rows back and had an amazing view. Food and drink stands are all over the place so it's easy to run up and get stuff during the game. Only issue I had was",
          "Been here a number of times! I enjoy the hockey and the concerts! A neat building! Yes the atmospshere is cool! and a good place for concerts! I really enjoy going here! If you don't want to pay for the parking, park a little away for alot less and walk it! Many people do! And",
          "Being a Canadian, i know hockey and hockey rinks. I was pleasantly surprised by the Honda Centre and the atmosphere at the game. The rink itself is 20 years old but it looks/feels great. The food and beer were very good albeit a little pricey. But what do you expect at an NHL",

          "We went there for a concert and it was clean and nice. BUT, we sat so far up it was frightening! The angle on the seating almost made us sick, but kept us in our seats! We were to afraid to go down to buy anything. I would suggest buying anything before you go up, or just",
          "We visited the Honda Center to watch Stars on Ice. We were greeted at the parking lot entrance by a very polite and knowledgeable attendant. She offered advice on where to park to save steps in getting to the proper seating area. We had elected to take advantage of a dining",

          "Went to see Ducks vs Sharks. Not a bad seat in the house and the prices are okay. Good food everywhere in the arena. Location is in the same area as Disneyland. You do have to pay to park anywhere in the area but that is typical of all arenas. Food choices are excellent from",
          "Went here for The Who show in January, which was a wonderful performance. Regarding the facilities...although traffic direction was run well... the 20 dollar fee to park was ridiculous... they already get a cut of the ticket price - also ridiculous. The interior... well this",
          "A great night had by all at the Honda Center. It's always a little pricey. Not so much for the ticket for the game (which is understandable) but yes - the food is overpriced. However, the staff is warm and courteous and the entertainment a great value. Perhaps we are",

          "Went to the Honda Centre and a got a detailed tour during an open house. Nice to see all the tributes to the Ducks teams that won the Stanley Cup. Sports shop is pricey. More information on this area is available at prasadandassociates.com - this is a nice area to drive around",

          "Nice, clean just a little pricey. Lots of selections of Alcohal & food. Everyone that works there has always been friendly. I feel safe there. Great seats. They have desert carts with candy apples & etc. Also not just beer & wine . You can get a cocktail. & coffee drinks.",
          "Went here for a concert and the venue could use some updating with food services. Additionally, the acoustics in the place weren't so great. I will definitely not go back for a concert unless its the only place the person is performing.",
          "My family has enjoyed hundreds of events at the Honda Center going back to opening night for the Mighty Ducks. The facility was originally built as an upscale venue; however, that is no longer the case. The seats are dirty and the floors under the seats are disgustingly black",

        "wiki": "Anaheim () is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th-most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second-largest city in Orange County in terms of land area, and is known for being the home of the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, and two major sports teams: the Anaheim Ducks ice hockey club and the Los Angeles Angels baseball team.\nAnaheim was founded by fifty German families in 1857 and incorporated as the second city in Los Angeles County on March 18, 1876; Orange County was split off from Los Angeles County in 1889. Anaheim remained largely an agricultural community until Disneyland opened in 1955. This led to the construction of several hotels and motels around the area, and residential districts in Anaheim soon followed. The city also developed into an industrial center, producing electronics, aircraft parts and canned fruit. Anaheim is a charter city.Anaheim's city limits extend almost the full width of Orange County, from Cypress in the west, twenty miles east to the Riverside County line in the east, encompass a diverse range of neighborhoods. In the west, mid-20th-century tract houses predominate. Downtown Anaheim has three mixed-use historic districts, the largest of which is the Anaheim Colony. South of downtown, a center of commercial activity of regional importance begins, the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city, which stretches east and south into the cities of Orange, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. This edge city includes the Disneyland Resort, with two theme parks, multiple hotels, and retail district; Disney is part of the larger Anaheim Resort district with numerous other hotels and retail complexes. The Platinum Triangle, a neo-urban redevelopment district surrounding Angel Stadium, which is planned to be populated with mixed-use streets and high-rises. Further east, Anaheim Canyon is an industrial district north of the Riverside Freeway and east of the Orange Freeway. The city's eastern third consists of Anaheim Hills, a community built to a master plan, and open land east of the 241 tollway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAnaheim's name is a blend of Ana, after the nearby Santa Ana River, and German -heim meaning \"home\", which is also a common Germanic place name compound (compare Trondheim in Norway and many place names in Germany).The city of Anaheim was founded in 1857 by 50 German-Americans who were residents of San Francisco and whose families had originated in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Franconia in Bavaria.  After traveling through the state looking for a suitable area to grow grapes, the group decided to purchase a 1,165 acres (4.71 km2) parcel from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros' large Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana in present-day Orange County for $2 per acre.For $750 a share, the group formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company headed by George Hansen. Their new community was named Annaheim, meaning \"home by the Santa Anna River\" in German. The name later was altered to Anaheim. To the Spanish-speaking neighbors, the settlement was known as Campo Alem\u00e1n (English: German Field).\n\nAlthough grape and wine-making was their primary objective, the majority of the 50 settlers were mechanics, carpenters and craftsmen with no experience in wine-making. The community set aside 40 acres (16 ha) for a town center and a school was the first building erected there. The first home was built in 1857, the Anaheim Gazette newspaper was established in 1870 and a hotel in 1871. The census of 1870 reported a population of 565 for the Anaheim district. For 25 years, the area was the largest wine producer in California. However, in 1884, a disease infected the grape vines and by the following year the entire industry was destroyed. Other crops \u2013 walnuts, lemons and oranges \u2013 soon filled the void. Fruits and vegetables had become viable cash crops when the Los Angeles \u2013 Orange County region was connected to the continental railroad network in 1887.\n\n\n=== Helena Modjeska ===\nPolish actress Helena Modjeska settled in Anaheim with her husband and various friends, among them Henryk Sienkiewicz, Julian Sypniewski and \u0141ucjan Paprocki. While living in Anaheim, Helena Modjeska became good friends with Clementine Langenberger, the second wife of August Langenberger. Helena Street and Clementine Street are named after these two ladies, and the streets are located adjacent to each other as a symbol of the strong friendship which Helena Modjeska and Clementine Lagenberger shared. Modjeska Park in West Anaheim, is also named after Helena Modjeska.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Anaheim was a massive rural community dominated by orange groves and the landowners who farmed them. One of the landowners was Bennett Payne Baxter, who owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of Angel Stadium. He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners. He was not only successful, he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well. Ben Baxter and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community before the opening of Disneyland transformed the city. A street along Edison Park is named Baxter Street. Also during this time, Rudolph Boysen served as Anaheim's first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950. Boysen created a hybrid berry which Walter Knott later named the boysenberry, after Rudy Boysen. Boysen Park in East Anaheim was also named after him.\n\nIn 1924, Ku Klux Klan members were elected to the Anaheim City Council on a platform of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day. The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1200 members in Orange County. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were the majority of their opponents; however, the opposition to the Klan also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County who joined the Klan did so out of a sense of civic activism. Upon easily winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.The opposition to the KKK's hold on Anaheim politics organized, bribed a Klansman for their secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries, defeating most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed; its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.\n\n\n=== Disneyland and the late 20th century ===\n\nConstruction of the Disneyland theme park began on July 16, 1954, and it opened to the public on July 17, 1955. It has become one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, with over 650 million visitors since its opening. The location was formerly 160 acres (0.65 km2) of orange and walnut trees. Hotels and motels began to spread and residential districts soon followed. By the mid-1960s, the city's explosive growth would attract a Major League Baseball team, with the California Angels relocating from Los Angeles to Anaheim in 1966, where they have remained since. In 1980, the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams relocated from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the Angels' home field, Anaheim Stadium, playing there until their relocation to St. Louis in 1995. In 1993, Anaheim gained its own National Hockey League team when The Walt Disney Company founded the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. \nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported Anaheim's population as 9.3% Hispanic and 89.2% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Anaheim grew rapidly in population. Today, Anaheim has a diverse ethnic and racial composition.During the large expansion of the Disneyland Resort in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the city of Anaheim recognized the surrounding Anaheim Resort area as a tourist destination. It includes the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, the Honda Center, and Angel Stadium.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, Disney's California Adventure (renamed Disney California Adventure Park in 2010), the most expansive project in Disneyland's history, opened to the public. In 2007, Anaheim celebrated its sesquicentennial.In July 2012, political protests by Hispanic residents occurred following the fatal shooting of two men, the first of whom was unarmed. Protesting occurred in the area between State College and East Street, and was motivated by concerns over police brutality, gang activity, domination of the city by commercial interests, and a perceived lack of political representation of Hispanic residents in the city government. The protests were accompanied by looting of businesses and homes.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAnaheim is located at 33\u00b050\u203210\u2033N 117\u00b053\u203223\u2033W and is approximately 25 miles (40 km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The city roughly follows the east-to-west route of the 91 Freeway from the Orange-Riverside county border to Buena Park. To the north, Anaheim is bounded by Yorba Linda, Placentia, Fullerton, and Buena Park (from east to west). The city shares its western border with Buena Park and Cypress. Anaheim is bordered on the south by Stanton, Garden Grove, and Orange (from west to east). Various unincorporated areas of Orange County also abut the city, including Anaheim Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 50.8 square miles (132 km2), 49.8 square miles (129 km2) of which is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) of which (1.92%) is water.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city recognizes several districts, including the Anaheim Resort (the area surrounding Disneyland), Anaheim Canyon (an industrial area north of California State Route 91 and east of California State Route 57), and the Platinum Triangle (the area surrounding Angel Stadium). Anaheim Hills also maintains a distinct identity. The contiguous commercial development from the Disney Resort through into the cities of Orange, Garden Grove and Santa Ana has collectively been termed the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city.\n\n\n=== Communities and neighborhoods ===\n\nDowntown Anaheim is located in the heart of the Colony Historic District. Downtown is the administrative heart of the city where City Hall, Anaheim West Tower, Anaheim Police Headquarters, the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce and the Main Library are located. Anaheim Ice (formerly Disney Ice), the Downtown Anaheim Farmer's Market, a food hall in a historic 1919 Sunkist packing house, and the Center Street Promenade are also located in Downtown Anaheim. In late 2007, The Muzeo, the newest major museum in Orange County, opened its doors for the first time and is located next to Anaheim West Tower. Pearson Park is also located in Downtown Anaheim, and is named after Charles Pearson, who was Mayor of Anaheim during the time Walt Disney opened Disneyland in Anaheim. One of the major attractions located in Pearson Park is the Pearson Park Amphitheater. In the Colony Historic District just west of Downtown Anaheim is the Mother Colony House, which was built by George Hanson and was the first house built in Anaheim, the founder of Anaheim. Today, it is Anaheim's and Orange County's oldest extant museum. The Woelke-Stoeffel House is a Victorian mansion located next door to the Mother Colony House. Originally the Victorian Home was occupied by the Stoeffel family, early pioneer residents of Anaheim. The home served as headquarters for the local Red Cross until the early 1990s. In 2010\u20132011, the Woelke-Stoeffel house became refurnished and is now part of the Founder's Park complex. Founder's Park includes the Mother Colony house and a carriage house, which serves as a museum of Anaheim's agricultural history.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many other South Coast cities, Anaheim maintains a Subtropical Mediterranean climate Csa, enjoying warm winters and hot summers.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Anaheim had a population of 336,265.

Team spokesmen pointed out that from its inception, the Angels had been granted territorial rights by Major League Baseball to the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino in addition to Orange County. The new owner, Arturo Moreno, believed the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County. The \"of Anaheim\" was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that \"Anaheim\" be included in the team's name.\nMayor Curt Pringle and other city officials countered that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises, Inc., then the ownership group for the Angels. They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation, but provided very little revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball LP in Orange County Superior Court, and a jury trial was completed in early February 2006, resulting in a victory for the Angels franchise.\nAnaheim appealed the court decision with the California Court of Appeal in May 2006. The case was tied up in the Appeals Court for over two years. In December 2008, the Appeals Court upheld the February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of Angels Baseball. In January 2009, the Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case any further, bringing an end to the four-year legal dispute.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\nAnaheim was, at one point in time, one of the most politically conservative major cities in the United States. However, in recent years it has been moving leftward. According to the California Secretary of State, as of October 22, 2018, Anaheim has 141,549 registered voters. Of those, 58,411 (41.27%) are registered Democrats, 39,885 (28.18%) are registered Republicans, and 37,877 (26.76%) have declined to state a political party/are independents.\n\n\n=== City government ===\n\nUnder its city charter, Anaheim operates under a council-manager government. Legislative authority is vested in a city council of seven nonpartisan members, who hire a professional city manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The mayor serves as the presiding officer of the city council in a first among equals role. Under the city's term limits, an individual may serve a maximum of two terms as a city council member and two terms as the mayor.\nUp until 2014, all council seats were elected at large. Voters elected the mayor and four other members of the city council to serve four-year staggered terms. Elections for two council seats were held in years divisible by four while elections for the mayor and the two other council seats were elected during the intervening even-numbered years.\nIn response to protests and a California Voting Rights Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and several residents, the city placed two measures on the November 2014 ballot. Measure L proposed that council members be elected by district instead of at large. Measure M proposed to increase the number of council seats from five to seven. Both measures passed.The current city council consists of:\nMayor Harry Sidhu (since 2018)\nDenise Barnes, District 1 (since 2016)\nJordan Brandman, District 2 (since 2018)\nJose F. Moreno, District 3 (since 2016)\nLucille Kring, District 4 (since 2012)\nStephen Faessel, District 5 (since 2016)\nTrevor O'Neil, District 6 (since 2018)\n\n\n=== Federal, state and county representation ===\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Anaheim is split among three Congressional districts:\nCalifornia's  39th congressional district, represented by Democrat Gil Cisneros,\nCalifornia's  45th congressional district, represented by Democrat Katie Porter, and\nCalifornia's  46th congressional district, represented by Democrat Lou Correa.In the California State Senate, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  29th Senate District, represented by Republican Ling Ling Chang,\nthe  34th Senate District, represented by Democrat Tom Umberg, and\nthe  37th Senate District, represented by Republican John Moorlach.In the California State Assembly, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  65th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Sharon Quirk-Silva,\nthe  68th Assembly District, represented by Republican Steven Choi, and\nthe  69th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Tom Daly.On the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Anaheim is divided between two districts, with Anaheim Hills lying in the 3rd District and the remainder of Anaheim lying in the 4th District:\n\n3rd, represented by Donald P. Wagner since 2019\n4th, represented by Doug Chaffee since 2019\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Emergency services ===\n\nFire protection is provided by the Anaheim Fire Department, Disneyland Resort has its own Fire Department, though it does rely on the Anaheim Fire Department for support, and for Paramedic Services. Law enforcement is provided by the Anaheim Police Department. Ambulance service is provided by Care Ambulance Service.\n\n\n=== Anaheim Public Utilities ===\nAnaheim Public Utilities is the only municipal owned water and electric utility in Orange County, providing residential and business customers with water and electric services. The utility is regulated and governed locally by the City Council. A Public Utilities Board, made up of Anaheim residents, advises the City Council on major utility issues.Anaheim has decided to bury power lines along major transportation corridors, converting its electricity system for aesthetic and reliability reasons. To minimize the impact on customer bills, undergrounding is taking place slowly over a period of 50 years, funded by a 4% surcharge on electric bills.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nIn 2003, Anaheim reported nine murders; given its population, this rate was one-third of the national average. Reported rapes in the city are relatively uncommon as well, but have been increasing, along with the national average. Robbery (410 reported incidents) and aggravated assault (824 incidents) rank among the most frequent violent crimes in the city, though robbery rates are half of the national average, and aggravated assaults are 68% of the average. 1,971 burglaries were reported, as well as 6,708 thefts, 1,767 car thefts, and 654 car accidents. All three types of crime were below average. There were 43 cases of arson reported in 2003, 43% of the national average.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nAnaheim is served by seven public school districts:\n\nAnaheim is home to 74 public schools, of which 47 serve elementary students, nine are junior high schools, fourteen are high schools and three offer alternative education.\nPrivate schools in the city include Acaciawood Preparatory Academy, Cornelia Connelly High School, Fairmont Preparatory Academy, Servite High School and Zion Lutheran School (PS2-Grade 8).\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nAnaheim has three private universities: Anaheim University and Southern California Institute of Technology (SCIT), and Bristol University (BU) with its sport teams Bristol Bears.\nThe North Orange County Community College District and Rancho Santiago Community College District serve the community.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nAnaheim has eight public library branches.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nIn the main portion of the city (not including Anaheim Hills), the major surface streets running west\u2013east, starting with the northernmost, are Orangethorpe Avenue, La Palma Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Ball Road and Katella Avenue. The major surface streets running south\u2013north, starting with the westernmost, are Knott Avenue, Beach Boulevard (SR 39), Magnolia Avenue, Brookhurst Street, Euclid Street, West Street/Disneyland Drive, Harbor Boulevard, Anaheim Boulevard, East Street, State College Boulevard, Kraemer Boulevard, and Tustin Avenue.\nIn Anaheim Hills, the major surface streets that run west\u2013east include Orangethorpe Avenue, La Palma Avenue, Santa Ana Canyon Road, and Nohl Ranch Road. Major surface streets that run north\u2013south include Lakeview Avenue and Fairmont Boulevard. Imperial Highway (SR 90) and Yorba Linda Boulevard/Weir Canyon Road run as south\u2013north roads in the city of Anaheim, but north of Anaheim, they become west\u2013east arterials.\nSeven Caltrans state-maintained highways run through the city of Anaheim, four of which are freeways. They include the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the Orange Freeway (SR 57), and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). The Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), and the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 241) also have short stretches within the city limits. Also, SR 90 and SR 39 run through the city as regular streets.\nAnaheim is served by two major railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway. In addition, the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), a major regional transit station near Honda Center and Angel Stadium, serves Amtrak, Metrolink, and several bus operators, and the Anaheim Canyon Metrolink station serves Metrolink's IEOC Line. ARTIC is a proposed stop on the proposed California High-Speed Rail network.The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) provides bus service for Anaheim with local and county-wide routes, and both OCTA and Los Angeles County Metro operate bus routes connecting Anaheim to Los Angeles County. Also, Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) provides local shuttle service in and around the Anaheim Resort area, serving local hotels, tourist attractions, and the Disneyland Resort. Disney GOALS operates daily free bus service for low-income youth in the central Anaheim area. A proposal for streetcar service along Harbor Boulevard was rejected in 2018.\nAnaheim is equidistant from John Wayne Airport and Long Beach Airport (15 miles), but is also accessible from nearby Los Angeles International (30 miles), and Ontario (35 miles) airports.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAnaheim has the following sister cities:\n\nMito, Japan\nVitoria-Gasteiz, Spain\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of California\nList of cities and towns in California\nList of museums in Orange County, California\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAnaheim Historical Society\nAnaheim, California on the C-SPAN Cities Tour website",

        "wiki": "Disney California Adventure Park, commonly referred to as Disney California Adventure, California Adventure, or DCA, is a theme park located in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and Products division. The 72-acre (29 ha) park is themed after the history and culture of California, which celebrates the fun and adventure of the state through the use of various Disney, Pixar and Marvel properties. The park opened on February 8, 2001 as Disney's California Adventure Park or Disney's California Adventure, and it is the second of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort complex, after Disneyland Park.\nThe concept of a theme park dedicated to California arose from a meeting of Disney executives in 1995, following the cancellation of the WestCOT project. Construction of the park began in June 1998 and was completed by early 2001. Disney initially projected high attendance rates at the new park; however, a series of preview openings held in January 2001 led to negative reviews, and after the park officially opened to the public on February 8, 2001, the company's attendance projections were never met. Disney spent the next several years incrementally adding new rides, shows, and attractions, and implementing other promotions aimed at boosting attendance. In 2007, Disney announced a major expansion of the park as well as a major overhaul of a significant portion of the park. Construction lasted for five years and was completed in stages, culminating with the opening of Buena Vista Street and Cars Land in June 2012.\nAccording to the Themed Entertainment Association, the park hosted approximately 9.9 million guests in 2018, making it the 12th-most visited theme park in the world that year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Concept and creation ===\n\nThe present-day site of Disney California Adventure was acquired by Walt Disney in the 1950s and functioned as the parking lot of Disneyland for over 40 years. After succeeding with the multi-park business model at Walt Disney World in Florida, the Disney company decided to turn Walt Disney's original theme park into a multi-park resort complex as well. In 1991, Disney announced plans to build WestCOT, a west coast version of what was then known as EPCOT Center, on the site of Disneyland's parking lot. The high price tag of the proposed park as well as the company's financial and public relations problems with the newly opened Euro Disneyland (now Disneyland Paris) led Disney to cancel WestCOT in 1995.In the summer of 1995, Michael Eisner, Disney's CEO at the time, gathered company executives in Aspen, Colorado, to think of another idea for a second theme park in California. From those meetings, Disney decided it would instead build a park themed to the history and culture of the state of California. Disney's executives aimed to make California a theme park, so as to keep guests at the resort instead of going off site. Then Disneyland president Paul Pressler relied on merchandising and retail staff instead of Imagineers to design the park. As an adult-oriented park like Epcot, dining and shopping was the design focus. Construction of the park began on January 22, 1998. On Main Street, U.S.A., a DCA Preview Center opened in October 1998. The park's construction was accompanied by Downtown Disney and Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, in addition to renovations of the Disneyland Hotel and Disneyland Pacific Hotel.\n\n\n=== Opening and initial criticism ===\n\nThe park was expected to draw large crowds when it opened on February 8, 2001. There were four districts with 22 shows and attractions and 15 restaurants.On January 14, a Los Angeles Times article titled \"The most Jam-Packed Theme Park on Earth?\" stated, \"Senior Disney officials acknowledge that there will be days when California Adventure will have to turn patrons away, particularly in the first weeks after the park opens, during spring break and again in the summer.\" However, the actual attendance that year was substantially less than expected. This is suggested to have happened as a result of negative reviews from early visitors, including the lack of focus in the Hollywood Pictures Backlot, the lack of attractions for children, a large number of off-the-shelf attractions, a high number of stores and restaurants relative to the number of attractions, and having a theme that was considered to be redundant, given that the park is located in California. The park also lacks a perimeter berm to separate it from surrounding neighborhoods. The berm in Disneyland Park uses trees and earthen mounds to establish a physical barrier around the park so that structures external to the park cannot be seen, with the aim of more fully immersing guests in the park setting. At Disney California Adventure Park, nearby hotels, power lines, radio towers, and the Anaheim Convention Center are all visible, reducing the sense of immersion.  Furthermore, Disney had originally planned the park to be aimed at adults, rather than children, which became the basis of significant criticism.The park opened to only 5 million visitors in 2001 while its sister park Disneyland saw 12.3 million visitors during the same time frame. Low attendance caused Disney to lower ticket prices for California Adventure, slashing as much as $10 off the park's ticket prices. In its first year, the park only averaged 5,000 to 9,000 visitors on weekdays and 10,000 to 15,000 on the weekends, despite having a capacity of 33,000. Visitor surveys reported that only 20% of visitors to the park in its first year were satisfied with their experience. By October 2001, both Wolfgang Puck and Robert Mondavi had closed their high-profile restaurants in the park, citing low crowds, though Mondavi remained as a sponsor.\n\n\n=== Early changes and expansions ===\nTwo major criticisms of the park in its first year were the lack of attractions appealing to children and the lack of a nighttime show or parade to keep visitors from leaving at nightfall. Within the first year of operation, Disney's Electrical Parade and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It! were brought to the park, and several of its original rides and attractions were closed, including Superstar Limo and the stage show Disney's Steps in Time. During the 2001 holiday season, Disney's LuminAria was presented on Paradise Bay. In October 2002, the Flik's Fun Fair area opened, which added attractions for children, and in May 2004, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror opened as another E ticket. The park regularly featured seasonal promotions such as concert series, food festivals, and promotions for other Walt Disney Company franchises including the X Games and ABC soap operas. Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! opened in the former Superstar Limo building in January 2006.\n\n\n=== Major redesign and expansion ===\n\nBy 2007, Disney began making plans for major updates to the park. CEO Bob Iger said, \"Any time you do something mediocre with your brand, that's a withdrawal. California Adventure was a brand withdrawal.\" Iger briefly considered combining California Adventure and Disneyland Park into one large park, but the price would have cost as much as completely remodeling California Adventure. On October 17, 2007, The Walt Disney Company announced a multi-year, $1.1 billion redesign and expansion plan for Disney's California Adventure Park (against its initial $600 million price to build). Each district was reimagined to transform the park from a spoof of modern California culture to a romanticized, idealized version of the state, exploring specific time periods and historic settings. The project began in December 2007 and was completed in stages. Toy Story Midway Mania! opened on Paradise Pier in June 2008, in space formerly occupied by a store and restaurants. World of Color, a nighttime water and lights show on Paradise Bay, opened in June 2010. The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure opened on the site formerly occupied by the Golden Dreams theater in June 2011.\n\nThe most drastic changes to the park included a complete overhaul of the main entrance, Sunshine Plaza, and Paradise Pier, as well as an expansion into the last of the parking area originally designated as future growth space for the park. The main entrance and Sunshine Plaza were turned from a \"giant postcard\" spoof of California into Buena Vista Street, a representation of Los Angeles as it appeared when Walt Disney moved there in the 1920s.  The \"CALIFORNIA\" sign in front was removed and donated to Cal Expo in Sacramento. Paradise Pier was turned from a contemporary representation of California boardwalks into a representation of Victorian seaside amusement parks of the 1920s, and some of the area's off-the-shelf rides were either removed outright (Maliboomer) or re-themed to have more of a focus on Disney characters (Mickey's Fun Wheel, Goofy's Sky School, Silly Symphony Swings). Cars Land, an area that simulates Radiator Springs from Disney\u00b7Pixar's Cars film franchise, was added to the southeast portion of the park and features three rides, including the E ticket Radiator Springs Racers. Construction was completed in 2012 and the park was then re-dedicated on June 15, 2012. The park received a modified name, Disney California Adventure, and a new logo first put into use  in June 2010.The redesign and expansion of the park saw attendance rates increase dramatically. In 2012, Disney California Adventure reached a record high for the park of over 7 million visitors (a 23% increase from the year before), a number Disney had hoped the park would attain in its first year. The day of the park's rededication saw the park draw a record number of 43,000 visitors in one day. The night before the rededication, over 500 people camped outside of the park in order to be the first admitted in. Two days later, the park hit a new record of 45,000 visitors. Speaking on the attendance increase at Disney California Adventure, Jay Rasulo, Disney's chief financial officer, said: \"We had a very uneven distribution where most people spent most of their time at Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure was empty. Now, half of the folks go to one, half of the folks go to the other. It's almost a dream come true.\"In 2019, a Disney+ episode of \"The Imagineering Story\" covered the negative reaction that the park received in its early days. Disney Legend John Hench was quoted as saying \"I liked it better as a parking lot.\"Disney California Adventure, along with Disneyland, was closed indefinitely starting on March 14, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n1991: The Walt Disney Company announces plans to build WestCOT.\n1995: WestCOT plans are scrapped and Disney instead announces plans for a California-themed park.\n1998: Construction begins on Disney's California Adventure.\nFebruary 8, 2001: Disney's California Adventure opens to the public.\nJuly 2, 2001: The Main Street Electrical Parade, renamed \"Disney's Electrical Parade\", moves to the park to celebrate the park's first summer.\nJanuary 11, 2002: Superstar Limo closes.\nOctober 7, 2002: A Bug's Land opens as the first new themed area since the park's inception, with new attractions including; Flik's Flyers and Heimlich's Chew Chew Train.\nMay 5, 2004: The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror opens as the second version of the attraction.\nJuly 15, 2005: Turtle Talk with Crush, Disney's second version of the attraction, opens two days before Disneyland's 50th Anniversary.\nJuly 17, 2005: Block Party Bash has its first performance, to be partnered with Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams in Disneyland Park.\nJanuary 23, 2006: Monsters, Inc.

It is set in a modern-day California city. Similar to Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland Park, it has shops, restaurants, and a system of transportation. It also has a central hub to other areas at the end of it. This hub has entrances to Hollywood Land, Grizzly Peak, Public Wharf, and Paradise Gardens Park. Guests can ride from Buena Vista Street to the end of Hollywood Land on the Red Car Trolley. Its station is located near the main entrance by the flagpole. The trolley will eventually run through Avenger Campus and create a full loop around the park. Some restaurants along the street include Mortimer's Market, Trolley Treats, and Clarabelle's Hand Scooped Ice Cream. Shops include Oswald's, Big Top Toys, and Elias & Company. \n\n\n=== Pixar Pier ===\n\nPixar Pier is themed after Pixar films, namely the Toy Story characters, Inside Out, and The Incredibles films. The area is styled after a 1950's amusement park with a ferris wheel, old style roller coaster, carousel, and even a hot dog cart. The Mickey Mouse head on the ferris wheel serves as the park's emblem. The \"Pixar Pier\" sign with the signature ball is also presented on the Incredicoaster which can be seen from outside the park. Pixar Pier is also one of the areas to watch the World of Color water show. To the side of it is Paradise Gardens Park but the main entrance is a bridge connecting to Public Wharf. \n\n\n=== Paradise Gardens Park ===\nParadise Gardens Park is the largest area of the park. It is located at the center of the park and has direct entrances to all but one of the areas (Pixar Pier, Public Wharf, Buena Vista Street, Cars Land, and Grizzly Peak). It also has a pathway to, specifically, World of Disney and Downtown Disney. It is the prominent place to watch the World Of Color water show which is themed after The Wonderful World of Disney. It includes rides such as Ariel's Undersea Adventure, Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar, and a collection of Mickey Mouse themed attractions. \n\n\n=== Grizzly Peak ===\n\nGrizzly Peak is themed around California's wilderness and national parks, with particular references to Yosemite and Redwood national parks. Its main attraction is Grizzly River Run, a Gold Rush-esque river rapids ride around the summit of Grizzly Peak. Nearby is the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail; a playground area that includes elements from Disney's Brother Bear and Disney\u00b7Pixar's Up. An entrance exclusively accessible to guests of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa is located in this area.\nGrizzly Peak Airfield is a sub-land within the Grizzly Peak area of California Adventure Park. It is themed to an airfield in California's High Sierras in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The featured attraction is Soarin' Around the World, a ride that simulates a hang glider tour of locations, landscapes, and landmarks across six continents of the world. The district also contains the Smokejumpers Grill counter service restaurant, a shop, and a decorative fire lookout tower.\n\n\n=== Hollywood Land ===\n\nHollywood Land is inspired by the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s. It includes attractions based on film, television, theater and a subsection called Hollywood Studios, which is designed to appear as an active studio backlot. Found within that subsection is the 3D film Mickey's PhilharMagic and the Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! attraction, a dark ride based on the characters from Disney\u00b7Pixar's Monsters, Inc. The 2000-seat Hyperion Theater located in the center of Hollywood Land presents Frozen \u2013 Live at the Hyperion. At the far end of this area is Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!, which opened on May 27, 2017, based on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy film series.\nDisney Junior \u2013 Live on Stage! opened on March 25, 2011, and has featured stage productions such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Sofia the First, Doc McStuffins, and Jake and the Never Land Pirates. Its final day of performance was April 9, 2017. It was replaced by Disney Junior Dance Party, which opened on May 26, 2017, and most recently features Mickey and the Roadster Racers, Doc McStuffins, Vampirina, and The Lion Guard.\nThe restroom facilities in the district are designed in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright's Storer House, located in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles. The stamped concrete structure is typical of Wright's pioneering design.\n\n\n=== Cars Land ===\n\nCars Land spans 12 acres (49,000 m2) and contains three attractions. The largest attraction, Radiator Springs Racers, is a dark ride that utilizes the technology of Epcot's Test Track. Based on Pixar's Cars films, the ride begins with a scenic drive through the mountains, then enters a show building, where the vehicle finds its way into the town of Radiator Springs and gets a race briefing from Doc Hudson; the ride ends with an outdoor, side-by-side dueling race to the Comfy Caverns Motor Court. With a budget of an estimated US$200 million, it is the most expensive theme park ride ever built.The other attractions at Cars Land are family attractions with smaller height requirements: Mater's Junkyard Jamboree and Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters. Mater's Junkyard Jamboree opened with Cars Land in 2012. Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters opened on March 7, 2016, and replaced Luigi's Flying Tires.\nCars Land is designed as a life-size model and near-exact replica of the town of Radiator Springs from the Cars films. The land includes several dining and shopping venues. The district serves as a connection between Pacific Wharf, Hollywood Land, and A Bug's Land. Construction began in July 2009 and opened to the public on June 15, 2012.\nIn September 2017, Cars Land received Halloween decorations during Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort. Two Cars Land attractions, Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters and Mater's Junkyard Jamboree, became Luigi's Honkin' Haul-O-Ween and Mater's Graveyard JamBOOree.\n\n\n=== Future expansion ===\n\nOn March 20, 2018, the addition of a Marvel-themed land was announced, scheduled to open on July 18, 2020. The land will be based around the preexisting Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout! attraction and will be built on the former site of A Bug's Land. During the D23 Expo in August 2019, Disney announced that the Marvel-themed lands at Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris will be called \"Avengers Campus\".\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Hollywood Land ===\nBlack Panther\nAnna, Elsa, and Olaf from Frozen\nCaptain Marvel\nVampirina\nCaptain America\nSpider-Man\n\n\n=== Cars Land ===\nLightning McQueen\nTow Mater\nRed the Fire Engine\nCruz Ramirez\n\n\n=== Buena Vista Street ===\nCitizens of Buena Vista Street\nMickey Mouse\nMinnie Mouse\nDonald Duck\nDaisy Duck\nGoofy\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit\n\n\n=== Pacific Wharf ===\nNick Wilde\nJudy Hopps\n\n\n=== Pixar Pier ===\nMike Wazowski and Sulley from Monsters, Inc.\nEdna Mode, Mr. Incredible, Frozone and Mrs. Incredible from The Incredibles\nDug and Russell from Up\nWoody, Jessie, Bo Peep and Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story\nFlik and Atta from A Bug's Life\nJoy and Sadness from Inside Out\n\n\n=== Grizzly Peak ===\nChip n\u2019 Dale\nPluto\n\n\n== Former areas ==\n\n\n=== A Bug's Land ===\n\nA Bug's Land (stylized \"a bug's land\") was seen from the point of view of Flik, the inventor ant from the Disney\u00b7Pixar film A Bug's Life, where oversized human items were scattered throughout. It featured Flik's Fun Fair (a collection of themed, family and child-friendly attractions such as Flik's Flyers, Francis' Ladybug Boogie, Tuck & Roll's Drive 'em Buggies, Heimlich's Chew Chew Train, and Dot's Puddle Park). It opened as the park's first expansion in 2002 to expand the park's family-friendly attractions. The land was built around the existing attraction It's Tough to Be a Bug!, a 3D film based on A Bug's Life, which opened with the park in 2001.\nIt's Tough to Be a Bug! closed on March 19, 2018. A Bug's Land closed on September 5, 2018 to make way for the Avengers Campus, set to open in 2020.\n\n\n== Alcohol policy ==\nUnlike Disneyland Park (with the exception of Club 33 in New Orleans Square and Oga's Cantina in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge), Disney California Adventure serves beer, wine and cocktails throughout its restaurants, stands and food kiosks. The park also hosts the Disney California Adventure Food & Wine Festival, an annual event featuring a number of themed kiosks, each featuring food and beverages from a particular aspect of California cuisine.\n\n\n== Live entertainment ==\nDisney's California Adventure offers an array of entertainment options, including live performances and opportunities for guests to meet characters.\nLive performances:\n\nAt the Hyperion Theater, guests can see Frozen \u2013 Live at the Hyperion, an hour-long musical version of the film of the same name.

          "The park has vastly improved. I enjoy the food, drinks and themed areas. The park is extremely clean and the cast members are very helpful and hard-working. I didn't give it a higher rating because all Disneyland parks are very expensive \u2026",
          "I visited the California Adventure park with my fiancee, it's a great place to have fun and enjoy a day together. I recommend the Max Pass to anyone who doesn't want to spend more than a couple days in the park, otherwise you might want to \u2026",
          "This side of Disneyland is/was not as irritating at the actual \"Disneyland\" side. Although they did have a lot of construction going on also (it just seemed so odd because just a few years before you would hear or see anything being built \u2026",
          "Absolutely loved it! When we went we took advantage of the fast passes which made our first trip such a success.  We rode and visited every attraction in one day! The park attendants were so helpful and added to our visit. One tip I wish we \u2026",
          "Loved this place. First time ever in Disney and will definitely go back. One of the busiest days of the year being the last day before the children go back to school in America, we expected it to be busy and not get on many rides but we \u2026",
          "We love it at California Adventure. It's so much fun. We love the fact that the mobile app gives us so much opportunity to be able to ride our favorite rides when we're there. Also ordering food or drink off the app and not having to wait in a long line is so awesome and convenient for us.",
          "Came for the holidays and it was great. Came during the week it was great not to crowded. Got to do the whole park. Cant wait for marvel land to open next year. Had a great time eating all the holiday food they had all through the park. \u2026",
          "Let's be honest, this place is like the cooler sibling to Disneyland. It holds the same excitement and Disney magic as Disneyland however carrying within it this fresh new vibe. It also offers a variety of places to grab a drink while you stroll around or wait in line for a ride!",
          "Was here on my honeymoon in October 2019. My wife had been talk about DCA for many years trying to convince me to visit..and finally I made it, and fell in love.\n\nPixar Pier was such a beautiful place that I almost feel like I could live \u2026",
          "This place is a favorite for us.  We love the sentimentality of Disneyland, but the fresh innovation of CA Adventure just keeps coming.  And we can't WAIT for the Avenger's campus to open \ud83d\ude0d. We are especially impressed with the new heights \u2026",
          "You just cannot go wrong with anything Disney as far as I'm concerned. California Adventure draws a more mature crowd but is always ready for the kids too. The Food and Wine Festival was great! Can't wait for the Marvel themed land to open!",
          "I worked at Disneyland many many years ago, and was there for the opening of Splash Mountain. It has been almost 20yrs since I've returned to California. We eventually moved to Florida and enjoyed WDW for 10yrs. Returning home to the West \u2026",
          "Loved it!!! You have to get fast passes while your there though, even more so than Disney Land. Cars had a 3.5hr wait ALL DAY. With fast pass we were in in 5 minutes . They will stop handing out passes though if they get to busy with was \u2026",
          "You cannot miss this park! cars land is amazing!! Just like the movie! At night you get to see the water show! I went on holidays and it was Christmas themed! You just need one day to see everything.",
          "Great place to come and spend time with the family. The Food and Wine Festival is awesome, lots of new food and drinks to try. Make sure to wear comfy shoes as the lines were a bit long and as always lots of walking \ud83d\ude01",
          "Like Disneyland it is a good time. It has much more to enjoy than my last visit. The rudest were awesome!  Lunch there was a little disappointing but still good. Staff are always wonderful. Again, can't wait until our next visit.",
          "The best. Still busy but not as bad as Disneyland main park. Get tickets and fast passes to get into rides easier and quicker and to plan your day. Cars ride has long wait time but definitely worth it and guardians of the galaxy ride is amazing..",
          "The care to detail and customer service at the Disney Resorts are second to none. Not sure what else I can say. Just an amazing experience all around. My only complaint was the lack of gluten free options at quick service windows. That is too be expected everywhere but I was hoping Disney might be better with their options.",
          "The attractions at this park are interesting and fun! The staff are nice and polite. The restaurants here are at convenient locations. It is also great that there are a lot of benches all over the park for those who need to rest for a bit. At night, the park is well-lit.",
          "You can literally spend 12 hours inside this park and still enjoy it. There are a lot of rides with good replay values which is perfect. The rides here is suitable for any age. At the end of the day, you should not miss the light show. It's really an amazing park!",
          "Went the last day before they closed. And it was raining. Still made a few rides and such. But not the full experience. Still was amazing. Full of wonder. Highly recommend.",
          "Why is the food and drinks so good here? I mean you feel that you aren't here for the amusement part of the park. But the theme is food. It's a foodie park. At least that's how I see it. Not that expensive too. (Depending what you get) The irony.",
          "Love this place!  It is such a fantastic compliment to Disneyland.  Every trip to the resort, includes a lot of time spent here.  Cast members are always fantastic.  Never had a poor experience.  Truly an example of remarkable customer service.",
          "This was by far the better park compared to Disneyland. I loved the Cars themed area,  it was done perfectly.  Soaring over the world is a great experience and the Cars ride itself is fantastic! There are a couple routes you can take on \u2026",
          "On top of the magic that is Disney, they have great festivals at Disney California Adventure. I love them! The food kiosks are a fun way to taste new foods. There is nothing quite like food with Disney magic.",
          "Definitely visit if you've never been before. Rides are even fun for adults especially the Cars ride, the Incredicoaster, and the Guardians of the galaxy ride. Frozen musical was so so. I'm sure kids would love it though. If you come early \u2026",
          "First time visiting this week. We drove in from Arizona. California Adventure is so we'll put together. Our favorite experience (you can't just call them rides!) Was Guardians of the Galaxy and Radiator Springs race track. The road that \u2026",
          "I love everything Disney. I'm a huge fan. The park is nowhere the size of Disneyland, but you can't go wrong with Cars Land and all of the attractions California Adventure has to offer. I love everything at this venue. If you can get into \u2026",
          "Besides the outrageous prices of everything who wouldn't love California Adventure? We were there a couple weeks with our children who are 18, 13 and 12. We all had a blast. It's definitely improved from the past.",
          "Lots of fun for the whole family. Most everyone can enjoy the rides. There is different food choices for all tastes. If you just want to walk around there is a lot to look at and enjoy.",
          "What can you say...Disneyland is undoubtedly the happiest place on earth. Very well organized, clean and super fun. Night shows are an experience not to be missed. The cars ride is super fun without being scary even for little ones. If you are going I'd say - have fun!",
          "Absolutely loved this park. Do glad I got max pass for the day, as well. Quick on and off for all of the big name rides. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting but only had a day to split between both parks. Food selection was awesome. Wish they offered bread bowls at WDW!",
          "Perhaps it is my age, but the Magic Kingdom has lost its magic for me. I didn't feel this way when I was there 3 years ago. The whole atmosphere felt different. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy \"Soaring Around The World.\"",
          "There's so much to do here. California Adventure is all about fun, friends and food. Literally. The rides are fun for all ages and there is live entertainment from the moment you enter the park. The food festivals are held here throughout \u2026",
          "Came with my son Jason, daughter Marilyn and grandson Eli David. Food and wine \ud83c\udf77 festival. Great food , beer wine. Got the sip and savor pass. Worth it. Purchased one and we shared. Nice to spend time with my son and daughter. Eli is the bonus. No rain, walked went on some rides. Absolutely the best day.",
          "We had a great time here. For us (parents, 7 yrs and 6yrs) it might have been the best overall experience for us as a family. Very fun and interactive shows. The Crush turtle show had us quoting for the rest of the weekend. Meeting Elsa was \u2026",
          "I'm not sure how anyone, at any age, could fail to enjoy a day here. The staff are friendly, as was every visitor that we encountered.\nOur previous visit had been during summer, which had been much busier than this recent visit. That being \u2026",
          "always busy, find a slower day to go and you will have a good time",
          "DCA is always sick a fun time! Even if it's unexpectedly crowded on a projected low crowd day. There is plenty to do without waiting in line lines for rides. But with the Disney Play app, waiting in lines is much more tolerable and fun. The \u2026",
          "Basically this is the happiest place on Earth where your inner child gets to shine.\n\nGoing during Halloween was the best experience ever. Crowds were light and the weather was good.\n\nI highly recommend the Max Pass. It's so worth the money \u2026",
          "This place is amazing..  I need more time to cover every inch . Every cast member is helpful and very nice.. there is nothing left to chance.. everything is perfect, clean and happy.. this is my happy place.",
          "We loved our time at California Adventure. The Cars Land is amazing, you walk in and you feel like you are walking in the movie! Generally California Adventure seemed a bit busier than in Disneyland itself but if you\u2019re coming to either of these places you\u2019re ready for it to be busy anyway.",
          "First time coming here and it was so great. I felt like I got to do a lot more at this park and the rides were more of my liking. I also had the fastpass which allowed us to get on the rides that had longer waits. Decorations for Christmas \u2026",
          "Love it! This place was more interesting and fun than the Disneyland Park. There are so many things to do and see. Long lines are always worth the wait. I can't wait to go back again.",
          "Its signature Disney high-quality for sure, no doubt about it. And being able to drink is nice. But its just not Disneyland.  My kids prefer 2 days at Disneyland rather than 1 day at each park.",
          "I went to downtown Disney. And I had my parking ticket validated at the story book Cafe. When I Was leaving the parking. They told me that that validation wasn't. Good because it's part of the park. There's no sign. No one told me that and I had to pay $57 for parking unacceptable like Disney need the money.",
          "Soaring over CALIFORNIA! Apparently it's only back for the Food & Wine Festival 2020. Too bad. I do appreciate Soaring around the world. But the park is called CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE and visitors are treated to how lucky we are to be Californians. How about alternating the rotation so that it keeps it fresh.",
          "It's pretty good fun! Big thing that makes me appreciate this place is that the restaurants and small food vendors are much more food allergy aware and friendly! This also applies to Disneyland. If you are looking for a more in depth review, you might be better listening to someone else. I'm not quite ready to post mine yet :-)",
          "So much fun. I tried the Animation Academy class for the first time. An artists teaches the class hiw to sketch a Disney character. The class is about 15 minutes long. It was so pleasant, one of my favorite parts of the day!",
          "California adventure definitely offers less than Disneyland in terms of stuff for adults to do, but it has some of the best food options of both parks imo. Particularly, the lamplight lounge has amazing ratatouille that I crave whenever I\u2019m not at the parks. Simply amazing.",
          "The Asian eating place (don't know the name) that had the $24 tilapia (for 2.) I am posting a photo. Impressive presentation,  but the taste is out of this world. The flavor in the crunchy crust is amazing, and the fish was moist and absolutely delicious.",
          "Great decorations for the Christmas season. Many of the rides are customized for the holidays. Mater ride had a lot of funny jokes and songs. Food at Flo's Cafe was of good quality. Soaring Over the World is worth the wait. Watch out when \u2026",
          "Enjoy the less crowded atmosphere with fun  rides such as Midway Mania and Soaring. Entertaining shows such as  Mariachi Divas. Cost of food is expensive. Clean environment. Professional friendly staff.",
          "Going here was such a great time.  Soo recommend the World of Colors.  It's such a perfect end to the visit.  You'll NEVER for get it.  And will be talking to people about it for sure.\nENJOY your visit. \ud83d\ude00",
          "Awesome, but if I had to choose between this and the main park I'd definitely just go for the main park if time is a constraint. There's only like 4 or maybe 5 attractions that are worthwhile... but I do think the food is slightly better over here.",
          "Head out here for later in the day so you can experience it at night. Everything looks so amazing lit up! I would suggest a park hopper and MaxPass here simply because it\u2019s a smaller park and can cover most of the land in half a day. Great food at Lamplight as well.",
          "Cars Land and Pixar Pier were amazing. Had more fun there than Disneyland, but we enjoyed both. \n\nGive it a go if you haven't and you're trying to decide whether or not to do it as well.",
          "We went for the Oogie Boogie Party for Halloween.  Had an amazing experience.  The decorations were outstanding. Loved the parade and the music. The trick or treating was fun, lots of candy. Definitely going back every year for Halloween.",
          "Annual Pass holder here. It's a carnival type amusement park with Disney wrapping! The annual events and changes in food and decor are always delicious and cool. Grade A fun.",
          "It is a park that is in Disneyland Resort. REALLY cool park. Bunch of cool rides, restaurants, shops, and much more! This park is mostly for older kids...the service here is really good. The cast member are always smiling and they are there to help you. Be sure to stop by Disneyland and go here! Have to buy tickets in order to go.",
          "I had a great time coming here even though it's a much smaller park than Disneyland for the same price. The plus is that it's more designed for adults with there many options for drinks and the only smoking section in both parks I think. \u2026",
          "This is a brilliant theme park. It and Disneyland both get 5 stars from me. There\u2019s nothing else in the world like these parks, a wonderful experience that I\u2019ll always be so happy to have had every time! It\u2019s been a privilege. America you\u2019re fantastic, always putting on a great show! Love it so much! My advice, save and go!",
          "Had a blast here celebrating my 27th birthday with my girlfriend. Highly recommend the Cars ride at night. Radiator Springs Racers. It was an amazing ride.\n\nSubtracted 1 star because the Blue Sky Cellar wasn\u2019t open for no apparent reason \u2026",
          "Not as good as the Disney park,  but still worth going,  the Ariel ride here is a great ride to get out of the heat for a bit,  and the line moves fast.  Also the art studio where they teach you to draw a Disney character is something we \u2026",
          "It's Disney so you can't really go wrong. Took my kids to meet Anna, Elsa, & Olaf and had a complete blast! Great rides for adventurous and non adventurous types. Love this while place!!",
          "Its expensive and it's not worth the amount of money they make you pay. I get that it's fancy and everything\nbut I paid over 400$ to just go on to 3 rides?\nI don't think so\nIt's a Cool magical experience but not worth it",
          "Not as good as Disneyland but still wonderful! \n\nMy Fav is the left ride that was Twilight zone tower of terror. It is now Guardians. I prefer the older ride but this one is still awesome.  Great Corn dogs here at the corn dog castle as well. \n\nThe cars ride is great as well as the whole land.",
          "I\u2019m a huge fan of California adventure. This land has something for everyone. I love how you can also drink beer and just walk around with it, not that I drink a lot though. Plus, Avengers Campus is coming out soon too. Can\u2019t wait!",
          "Disney California Adventure Park, commonly referred to as Disney California Adventure, California Adventure, or DCA, is a theme park located in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, \u2026",
          "LOVE IT!!!  The Incredicoaster is awesome, Guardians of the Galaxy is amazing, and the Cars ride is so much fun.  World of Color is great to watch at night (when it's not breezy).  Highly recommend!",
          "This side of the park is more fun for adults and older children. Cars Land is my favorite! Kiddos will love Guardians of the Galaxy. Don't miss the World of Color light show on Pixar Pier! It's phenomenal.",
          "Fun place glad you are able to go from park to park to change it up a bit. Along with haveing downtown right by it for a break. Prices are high just to get in and everything around there.  I do like the fact that you can now have a drink when walking around even though there expensive",
          "First time here. The park is clean and the cast members are friendly. The ride and attractions are fun and the waiting times for a Saturday in October before Halloween are not bad. Moderate crow on Saturday afternoon. The Disneyland app \u2026",
          "Basically, a part of Disneyland exclusive to California, hence the name. But the theming is really perfect, with areas fitting to its name. The food is quite expensive but the great quality of them makes up for the cost. Like Disneyland, \u2026",
          "The extra $45 per ticket for the fast pass and photo pass is totally worth it. Max pass is great. The Disney app is free and let's you check wait times for rides, order and pay for food and drinks online and has navigation so you can see \u2026",
          "A place to be a kid. A place to be an adult. Disney Disney Disney. Yes! Season pass holders who reside in Las Vegas. Cheap thrills that are not going to gaming. 3 hr 30 min drive out of Vegas we get our thrill on many attractions such as guardians of the Galaxy, racers, Ariel's adventure.",
          "Rides are fun but short. Wait times are very long. Fast passes only mitigate the problem slightly. 12 hours in park only 2 maximum actually on the ride. Other 10 hours spent in lines",
          "Our family loves California Adventures! We have annual passes and visit multiple times a year. DCA has a variety of food options so everyone can find something they like. Plenty of characters to see and rides for all ages!",
          "Disney is the best when it comes to theme parks (and getting into your wallet). Always clean and courteous staff. You can not only enjoy the rides but experience the atmosphere.",
          "Great place to go visit. It's better on the weekday, although the fireworks can only be seen on the weekend. Still, lines are shorter. I would recommend bringing your own water bottle.",
          "Disney is great but they need a few more locations to draw off the crowds here, holiday lines were insane.  Personally rode less than 10 rides in 2 days.  I bought 6 two day passes plus parking for about $1500... How can I like this value proposition?",
          "California Adventure is great fun! If you are looking for more of the Pixar experience or if you want a drink then this is the place. It also has a fun California vibe to it obviously. The food court here is centralized and offers  San \u2026",
          "Yes yes.. I know Disneyland (California Adventure) is expensive.\nIf you have a child that is your \"Disney Princess\", then you absolutely have to come check it out at least once.\nIt makes it all worth it when you see their faces completely light up with excitement when they meet a Princess or go on their first ride.",
          "Fun place.  Love it wish it were open right now. Need a break.",
          "Very very full for the Christmas vacation. I do not recommend going during this time as they seem to almost oversell park tickets (I doubt a fire marshal would approve it for how many people were there) no ride closures. Fast pass line mixture with normal line seems way way off.",
          "I find the customer service on this side far better than the Disney side. Better ears too.\n\nYou also can't go wrong with the Guardians of the galaxy or cars rides and if u want something tamer try cruising over the world or the ferris wheel.",
          "10/10 would recommend. California Adventure gets better every time u come back (only every 5-10 years). A particular favorite is the immersive Cars Land which is done impeccably. Don\u2019t miss the Cars Land ride, the wait is insane Though so try for fast passes.",
          "Definitely fun. Also very pleased with the accessibility for people with wheelchairs so rides you can stay in your chair. Cast members are very welcoming and warm.",
          "The main Disneyland Park was great, but California Adventure really stole the show! Cars Land was amazing and they really replicated the desert race perfectly. Also, the waterfront is probably my favorite place. It has the Incredicoaster, and the views were gorgeous! Highly recommend!",
          "Its an amazing park so much to see and eat. I wish they had a few more rides for adults but it is what it is. Love Disney",
          "So beautiful.  My grand daughter is a princess, always in princess dresses.  She was right at home. She asked one of the princesses if she could live there too. Didn't want to leave",
          "I love this place. How can you be in a bad mood when kids are laughing around using their bubble making machines. I take my daughter every year. She loves it. And I love that she loves it.",
          "We had a great time and the kids enjoyed it. The lines were way too long and the fast pass was great but it is very limited. The price is what keeps it from getting 5 stars.  Soooo expensive. Not sure how the average American family can afford to vacation here. Which is sad because all should be able to enjoy such a landmark.",
          "A lot to do and see. Hidden Mickey's to find. Come hungry. Great shows, big and small. The Famtastic Show was my favorite. It amazes me how Walt Disney's imagination and dream has grown into amazing family fun. There really is something for everyone.",
          "Really fun, but long lines. Get there when it opens so u can at least have an hour of no lines. Go on the raft ride first to u can dry off all day. For raft ride, bring extra pair of shoes, u don't want to walk in soggy shoes.",
          "If you're not coming with little just, then it's definitely worth the extra price for the Park Hopper ticket. The rides at California Adventure are way more fun, it's a little less congested, and the water show at night is amazing. It meant \u2026",
          "I love visiting California Adventure Park. I like that it has a different feel than Disneyland. It's definitely geared towards the older children and adults, but there are still options for the little ones to do. I also like DCAs selection of food! I will be returning for years to come!",
          "I think this is the view from the little coffee shop which I love. you know Disneyland is so busy but sometimes it's just nice to sit and enjoy the decoration in the atmosphere just to get away you know. I love the view from the little Starbucks very dickensian.",
          "Beautiful happy place. Much more enjoyable when is not so busy. Speed pass is a  must!",
          "This is a great place to be with family and enjoy your time together. There are tons of great rides and food places to eat at if you wish. All together this is an amazing park. I don't regret any time I've spent there",
          "Love the park and the people watching. This trip it had been a few years since our last visit and found the park to be not in top condition. Napkins in the streets and buildings needing paint or a wash. Disappointed that the sparkle is gone.",
          "Great place to spend a day with family. Fun rides for the kiddos. Street shows are awesome. Kids had a blast. And the plus shorter lines.",
          "First time here. The park was great! Been to Disney world a million times but this was our first time here. Smaller park but they do have rides that Disney world does not have. Can't wait to go back",
          "Amazing. Can easily do this in 1 day. Fast pass makes it so much more achievable. Highly recommend the world of colour light show at night.",
          "Love California Adventure!!! We purchased Hopper tickets (we could enter both parks multiple times per day). I highly recommend this before your arrival and upgrade to the maxpass. It's worth the $$ if you want to get on certain rides. Use \u2026",
          "Much calmer, not as many people as in Disneyland. Easier pace. Still had a hard time finding the kiosks for fast pass, but got through the lines for the rides, a little quicker.",
          "Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth! We love going! So many generations of memories and happiness! The magic is ingrained in every bit of the design, the cast & the shows! It's the best family holiday!",
          "This place is full of adventure, fun, and thrills! Good food places too! There really is something for everyone. Cars Racers is by far my favorite. If you're looking for something more mellow and fun, the Midway Mania is a great choice. Go and check it out! And then head across to Disneyland!!!",
          "The Star Wars theme rides are amazing! My family thoroughly enjoyed our day! Here\u2019s a hint for local residents, go to Disneyland on rainy days, you won\u2019t regret it! You\u2019ll have the run of the park and hint hint most of the rides and cool attractions are indoors...thank me later\ud83d\ude03",
          "Having been to many of the Disney parks around the world, this is my personal favorite. The park is themed so well, you really feel like you are experiencing a different region as you traverse the park. From Hollywood to the redwoods, you \u2026",
          "We had so much fun! My little girl was so excited to see characters come to life. I also felt like a child again when I seen Spider-Man and the Black Panther and all the other marvel characters. We hope to visit again soon we were only there for a day and it rained so we didn't get to do a lot of stuff.",
          "Super funny! Love all the roller coaster, extremely love the cars adventure, you totally have to try it! And what more can I say about Disney, it is magical all the things they do! It totally worth it!",
          "An amazing place for adults and children. A bit expensive but it's worth every penny. You can bring your own food and drinks or you can enjoy all the delicious foods and unique drinks they have to offer. All while seeing plenty of characters and riding the amazing rides. Worth a family trip!",
          "Does anyone ever have anything negative to say about disney? Nope! Single rider is so awesome! The desserts are amazingly delicious. Just a super fun experience for the family. There really is something for everyone to enjoy.",
          "This was my first trip ever to the Disney California Adventure Park and it was amazing, my favorite experiences had to be Guardians of the Galaxy breakout mission, Cars Land, and The Incredicoaster. Honestly all the rides were really fun. \u2026",
          "Seriously could only last a day. You can bring snacks and drinks through the gate. Go there early in the morning so you can get to some of the good rides without the wait. Star wars one is fun guardian of the galaxy then the incredicoster. My wife an I are young really athletic and after a day we were over it. Fun tho.",
          "The evening light show was cancelled. Not happy about that otherwise, I personally don't see what is so special about it. I had fun only because all of my family was there.  I guess I expected more. Should my family decide to go again, I would, only to spend time with my loved ones.  Sorry, not a fan.",
          "Second happiest place on earth. All of the changes made in recent years have been done tastefully and only improved the experience. I\u2019m looking forward the the marvel changes.",
          "Nothing like Disney dining, great service, great food and awesome scenery.  I am not talking about quick service meals (the ones you order at a street cart or window but the sit down meals). Reservation are highly recommended but I just love it here",
          "Always a great time for baseball!  I personally always sit on the club level. It\u2019s worth the price and smaller crowds",
          "Park is beautiful, clean and the feel of nostalgia is on every restaurant, store and ride. It truly makes me feel like a kid all over again. It's great and fun however, the only drawback are the really long lines and it is a bit overcrowded each time I go.",
          "This is a great park to visit but the crowds are always crazy. We love the Defenders of the Univers ride!!! (I think that's right) but the line is so so long. Fast pass is always an option but you can only get one at a time until your \u2026",
          "Of course amazing, the lines were long the weekend before Thanksgiving but not horrible if you are strategic with the fast passes and such. Food options were great. The only down side is if you have a little one, there isn't as many rides \u2026",
          "Fun place as always. Rained the day before and the morning of. Surprised that many of the walk ways were so slippery. Saw kids running and sliding, that's how slick they were. Saw one thing that really bothered me. A child coming off the \u2026",
          "We love Disneyland California  Adventure so much! Such a clean park to go! So much detail was taken to make sure that you have an immersive experience on the rides. They are very can and help if you have a handicapped individual as well.",
          "Best place ever. Entertainment and attractions are all top notch and amazing. Spend at least 1 day here in your lifetime if you can. You wont regret it.",
          "Awesome. I have a disability and Disney accommodated me to the fullest extent. This place also really made it a magical experience for my 5 year old little girl. My family will definitely be annual pass holders.",
          "Greatest place on earth!! Fun rides, yummy food, lots of smiles, parades, light shows...lots of people, at times, too many though! Wear comfy shoes. So much to see and do. You need at least a day or 2 at each part to see all and do all! If it's not on bucket list, put it on!!",
          "Decided to give California Adventure a try.  Had such a great time during my 1st visit . But It was missing that especial magic that Disneyland has. I would probably buy a hopper pass next time just to go ride a couple of the rides and head \u2026",
          "We purchased two days tikets, but due the extreme rain we were only able to stay for one hour in the park on the second day.  We are a family of 4 that drove so far a way (10 hours) to enjoy Disneyland. I am wondering if some one can let us \u2026",
          "It\u2019s Disneyland California Adventure - how can you not love this place. Some people say that as they get older they lose interest in things like this - I\u2019m the opposite for sure - the older I get the more I appreciate how it brings out my \u2026",
          "I loved this park and Disneyland. So many rides and you're not traversing 4 parks to go to the same amount of rides. Everything felt close together and with our timing we could ride rides multiple times because it was off peak season.",
          "Loved the fact that they have Alcoholic drinks, especially after a long drive and dealing with crowds.  Variety of food during the Holidays it's one of my favorite.  The diversity of live music it's a plus.  Everything about this place is GREAT!",
          "Fun park! We got to reuse everything we wanted to even though it was really crowded. Would probably take only 1/2 day on a less crowded day.",
          "Great place to take the family, or just fun times with adults. Deffenatly recommend to do some planning ahead of time to find out if favorite characters or certain attractions are open or available during the time frame you will be \u2026",
          "Getting better every year we go. My daughter loved cars land it is very well done. Even the shows here are great.",
          "My Family and Grandson were able to run around everywhere to release their energy. It was like a play area with net, tunnels and slide. My Grandson loved it. Plus we were able to take a family picture with Santa Claus.",
          "The rides are fun and they sell great clam chowder. Expect the same long lines as any amusement park but have an ice cool beer while you wait",
          "FROZEN show was awesome. Like 1/2 a Broadway musical. Worth the price of admission",
          "Great park with tons to do! Ate at the LampLight Lounge and the potato skins and barbacoa nachos were insanely good. Our waiter made us drinks to go before we headed to Toy Story. Even with it crowded, there's plenty of room to walk or push \u2026",
          "Amazing experience, this park has something for everyone.  Fast, slow, action packed, adult, child, shows, rides, food.....fun.  This park seems busy in many ways.   While similar to the hub and spoke theme park layout it also has surprises \u2026",
          "Next to Disneyland this place is beyond awesome. Not sure if I agree with the merging of marvel but other than that pure awesomeness.",
          "Had an amazing time, they have rides for the whole family, and thrill rides as well. The radiator springs town looked amazing and the light show at night was simply mindblowing.",
          "This was a really great day out! California has really turned on the sunshine for us and we have had two gorgeous days, one at Disneyland and today at California Adventure. \n\nThis is really a 5 star, but I enjoyed Disneyland more for \u2026",
          "The experience was so much fun! With the max pass we were walking from ride to ride. The staff was very nice when rides would go down. We ended up breaking down on toy story mania twice, which wasted about 2 and a half hours if our time. \u2026",
          "For those of us who grew up within a few hours drive of Disney World, it will always be the quintessential 'Happiest Place on Earth'.  However, if you venture out to California and visit the original Happy Place, you may get a different \u2026",
          "Not that Disney needs any help but this side of the resort is my favorite for several reasons. The Cars land is terrific as also the Soarin ride. The water show in the evening is spectacular and the dining options varied and excellent. And \u2026",
          "The best amusement park. My favorite ride was Luigi's roadsters, fun but not too crazy!\ud83d\ude99\ud83d\ude96",
          "We had soup in a sourdough bowl and was very disappointed.  Soup was cold and bread was old..cast members were goofing around..would not recommend or go there again.. the park itself was beautiful..would recommend management hire a secret shopper and check out the service quality..",
          "Fun to be had, but not like the Main Disney side. Different vibe. Met a  Lot of lovely people. Good food.",
          "Love coming here even as an adult! There are so many great changes happening and more things to come such as AVENGERS CAMPUS! There\u2019s also lots to do and the rides are so fun. There are more rides here for bigger kids and adults rather than Disneyland.",
          "Absolutely a magical place. The rides are amazing for kids and adults. We had an amazing time with both my kids (3.5 and 1.5 year old)",
          "That was an amazing moment and remarkable experience. Really you can enjoy and worth it. We loved the park. It's really fun for the little ones, and if you're looking for a bit of a thrill, there are a few rides that may pique your \u2026",
          "Disneyland is a magical place! If you ever get to LA, it\u2019s worth the money and the trip! Even as an adult I had a wonderful time!",
          "Disney California Adventure Park is amazing. I'd never been to a single Disney park before this one, and I guess my expectation was that it would be like any other theme park. There was something else, something magical about it, and I \u2026",
          "Amazing place. Non stop entertainment and adventure. Long lines are always worth the wait. Attention to detail is phenomenal. Everything is very well organised. Loved every moment.",
          "This park has so many things to do and see we spent 2 days just to do all the things in there could have easily done 3 days. Cars land is great for the whole family. Cars racers gets huge lines late in the day so try to get there as early \u2026",
          "So much fun!  Went with a bunch of family, my kids and niece and nephews are all 6-8 and it was awesome!  Rode the incredicoaster 6 times in one day with my 8 yr old son and niece :)",
          "This is a fun place, but one day is quite enough. I had a two-day pass. First day was fun. But by the second day I'd had enough of tripping over unruly kids and dodging those lazy old duffers who refuse to walk and get all kamikaze with \u2026",
          "Love it, and always have, it just sucks to me that they had to remove some of the old rides, but at least they were replaced or updated. Can't wait to come back again.",
          "Loved it for no reason other than it's a great time every time I go. My daught and I had an absolute blast being able to get on pretty much any ride quickly,  enjoying the smaller crowds in the park and celebrating the holiday season.",
          "It is so much fun coming here.  A lot of unique rides/experiences compared to Disney World (in FL).  I love Cars land, by far my favorite ride is Radiator Springs.  Love the boardwalk feel as you walk throughout the park.",
          "Cars ride was awesome! Get there right when the park opens to be first online. Best ride on that side of the park. Radiator springs was my fav area, feels like you're right in the movie.",
          "Awesome rides, great plant based food options, and Cars Land is always a favorite! I also really love the Guardians of the Galaxy ride; I highly recommend it.",
          "We had a great day on Saturday.  Lots to do and see. They need to install bottle fillers and more water fountains.",
          "California Adventure is totally different from Disneyland. It has more of a hang out vibe. There are less rides, but they're still good. But it's a place to walk around, have a drink, eat some food. It has a more relaxed and wide open \u2026",
          "I love Disney California Adventure! The rides are fun and they serve alcohol there. They have transformed the entire park for Halloween and it looks amazing. It was tons of fun. The customer service at the food stands are great.",
          "Chinese lunar new year was why I truly went. It was year of the rat and thats my sign. The decor, food and entertainment was everything!",
          "Well. It's Disneyland. Worth every penny. Had a blast with my wife and 2 kids. We will come back for sure.",
          "New themes for old rides really revamped this area. Incredibles Roller Coaster & Guardians of the Galaxy tower of terror were both like a new ride. Sorry to see \"Bugs life\" is closed. Radiator Springs race is always a nice JOLT!",
          "Disney California Adventure was so fun! They have so many fun and exciting roller coasters. They also had so many great food and offer so many! My personal favorite was the incredicoaster! I overall had a blast at California Adventure and I'm looking forward to going again.",
          "Love the festival foods. Cozy cone is delicious and a good price for a filling \"snack\". Fun rides and doesn't seem overcrowded.",
          "Was great for a more updated side of Disney with the addition of Pixar but had several rides down due to season and some of the same issues as the Disney side, couldn't track down all the characters and some were not found at all. But still great time with amazing rides.",
          "A good place for family and family friends. Getting the max package for fast pass is very worthy: not only much less waiting time, but also easy to manage your schedule and plans much better.",
          "Even with a day of rain, this is the happiest place on Earth.  We had 4 rides shut down while we just got on the rides, or we were the next group to get on!  The crew were courteous, and polite, even with people losing their cool.  We \u2026",
          "So after reading all the reviews before showing up here, I found that fast passes are a must! We got the fast passes and still had over populated lines. We didn\u2019t even get to use the fast passes the way they were intended. You can only use \u2026",
          "Went here 2 years ago, great rides, great staff except for this one lady at the Toy Story ride. The only thing that sucks is that the lines can be a REALLY long wait. The food is a little pricy, but other than that it's a great place for the family.",
          "I wish I had gotten two days in Disneyland and skipped this park. There's only a couple of good rides and they are difficult to to get on. Had much more fun in Disneyland.",
          "Love the atmosphere and the open surroundings! Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout was a group favorite! Radiator Springs was incredible! The park offers many adult beverage stops!",
          "Very fun and full of surprises, the world of color is worth staying till 10pm",
          "The holiday festival has begun today. If you're not ready for the holidays yet, this is not the place to go. The food is great albeit a tad expensive. The lines were surprisingly not to long. We were able to park at Pixar Pals Parking \u2026",
          "First time at Disneyland. What an experience, for kids of all ages. Lots of walking if you want the whole experience. But well worth it. You will leave with an experience of a lifetime. \ud83d\ude03",
          "I much prefer Disneyland to DCA but there are some good rides here such as Soaring Over California, Toy Story Mania...and...well, that\u2019s  all that\u2019s worth it for me. Food and Wine Festival is held here.",
          "I've always love this place since I was a kid, never gets old for me. Amazing rides, although the wait times are long.",
          "DCA has really changed through out the years.  I love how it's still a family friendly environment. Also that it's a place to hangout with friends and loved ones to enjoy a wonderful dinner with drinks.  There's nothing better them enjoying the magic of Disneyland with a Mango Cart michelada \ud83e\udd70",
          "Continual disrespect of and contempt for its customers by Disney.  There are a couple of great rides (Incredicoaster!) but too many people and too much treatment like cattle.\n\nI suppose going is obligatory.  Just don't get in the trap of annual passholdership and the false economy of attending just because you have a pass.",
          "Again...Christmas time is the best time of year to go! All the employees truly made it Magical Holiday/ Birthday Trip for for my Special Needs Daughter in 2019! Thank You!!",
          "The 2020 Food and Wine was a great addition. The Beyond Meat cheeseburger mac and cheese was amazing!",
          "It is an excellent experience if you're with young children. As you get older the rides don't have the same excitement as Universal Studios or Great America Six Flags. But with the family it's a good time makes for enjoyable entertainment \u2026",
          "We have been here a few times. An amazing day out with the kids. We had a great time. DEFINATELY worth a visit.",
          "It's Disney. Say. No. More. Loved every second of the entire day. Always fun to make family memories here.",
          "This place is amazing for all ages! We had so much fun!!",
          "Another lovely visit at California adventure with my kid. Its a bit busy today but was also Gay day weekend and lots of red which i joined 18 years ago so happy to see everyone loud and proud and not just wearing red. Guardian of the galaxy monster escape was the best ride ever!!!",
          "Had the best time! My family enjoyed the rides more than once. No huge lines. It was just awesome.",
          "This place is amazing. So much to see, so little time. Make sure to fast pass the Christmas light show early in the morning. They go fast.",
          "I would tell anyone to at least try to go to Disneyland and California Adventure. You will be hooked. Family time and memories. You will love it!!",
          "Every one was so helpful and friendly to my family and me ,we were celebrating birthdays they gave us birthday pins that had our names ,everywhere we went they always said happy birthday to us -- was not to long of lines week days are best ,it was special ,magical time for all of us !!!",
          "It was a good time. The characters need to be managed better. Many dis appointed kids.",
          "Not as crowded as Disneyland,  but less to do. If you want the full day experience,  go to Disneyland . Staff is friendly,  food is good. Definitely family friendly.",
          "Love coming here! The rides are great. Be sure to do Soaring the World.",
          "My wife and daughters had a great time. I want to especially thank Disneyland for their special help being I have a Disibility with pain and walking. This trip my wife had hurt her knee and needed a brace and my daughter also has back \u2026",
          "Superb place. Do not visit on public holidays.",
          "Great park with intense rides. It's also a good park to go to if you're not up for the overcrowded Disneyland as there are generally a lot less people on this side.",
          "My children prefer California Adventure to Disneyland.  Pixar Pier is excellent for children and adults of all ages.  Fun characters, good food and fun rides.",
          "Never thought I would get on Guardians of the Galaxy it's fantastic!!!!  No time to think and oh how you will laugh\n\n also never planned on getting on incredicoaster.... got to catch it every time.   smooth ride terrifying yes but you'll smile all the way to the Finish",
          "I love coming to this park and the other. There is definitely something for everyone in the family to do and has a bit of a different food menu than Disneyland",
          "They've updated a few rides since I last visited but the Little mermaid ride is cute and fun, and they've always changed the twilight Zones tower of terror to Guardians of the Galaxy. More drops and twists you'd never expect, but still a \u2026",
          "It's a bit complicated to rate the entire park, but let it be known that if you take your siblings with you to the park, you'll feel just as inclined to make fun of them. Also, if you choose to have fun here, you will have fun.",
          "We had a ton of fun here! Guardians of the Galaxy was the absolute best rude, followed closely by Grizzly Rapids and Radiator Springs. When we got hot and tired, we headed over to Soaring for a delightful history lesson and some awesome \u2026",
          "I like this park, My favorite attractions in this park are:\nIncredicoaster (California Screamin)\nRadiator Springs Racers\nSoarin Over California\nPixar, Pal A Round (Mickey's Fun Wheel or Sun Wheel)\nGuardians of the Galaxy (Formely the Tower \u2026",
          "They never disappoint. It's always such a great time. Having annual pass you can just go for couple hours and enjoy knowing you will be back soon.",
          "All around fun for everyone, no matter your age. We had 3 generations in our group and all had a great time. Going back later this year.",
          "Very fun park!! Overall the rides here are great. I enjoyed the soarin ride a lot and guardians of galaxy was good as well.",
          "My 10 and 5 year olds loved it. Had a blast. Cars ride is awesome.",
          "Went during the Lunar New Year celebration, so the park offered Asian food, and there was a dragon semi-parade.  The bulk of the rides were for children over 40\", limiting our choices.  The Cars area was fun.  The park instituted mobile food ordering.",
          "One of my favorite places on Earth! It's not as busy as Disneyland, and has the best stomach dropping rides! It's small so it's great for little ones.",
          "The light show here by the pier is absolutely beautiful, my first time watching it I saw the Christmas version, I don't celebrate Christmas but just the imagery, I didn't expect it to be so extraordinary I cried because if the colors and \u2026",
          "Spent a whole day in just this park to see if we could he satisfied without going into Disneyland. We had a great time! Went on some rides we'd never been on and we have been coming for years!",
          "Was finally able to get on soarin my kids and I love it. I don't remember this seen so I'm sure they've change it. Which is nice to have something new to see, since we are passholders.",
          "Makes you feel like you are back in the 1920's as soon as you walk in. So much has been added over the years. I love it!",
          "Great for the kids. Great rides for all ages.",
          "It's Disneyland, so there's that. But it certainly NOT the happiest place on Earth. Lines even worse than I remembered. Staff pretty miserable, everything overpriced. Just not worth the effort frankly. Better places to spend your hard earned time and money.",
          "Just got to go here for the first time in January. Absolutely love the rides and the food options are insane!  Beer!  Vegan and gluten free food!",
          "Love this place. Got to go here for my 50th Birthday. Enjoyed the rides more than I thought I would.",
          "AMAZING!!! Go with your family. So many rides and sights. I got so many pictures with characters. I want to live there, literally. AWESOME!!!",
          "Second trip in my life and still makes me feel like a kid at age 53\ud83e\udd70",
          "Whats not to love about this adventurous park with my favorite toys in, Toy Story, Monsters Inc and don't forget my Favorite - hunk Captain America!! The rides are for all ages and there's something for everyone, including your granny.",
          "So much family fun here. Loved all the themes. And the cupcakes omg! Lol You cant come to Disneyland and not come to Adventure Park!",
          "I'm having a beautiful time with my kids but one is missing because is in the university of Fresno state",
          "Best day of my life, I recommend going on the incredible and the guardians of the galaxy. Trust me, you will not regret!",
          "Had a great experience. Was my first time here. Definitely buy the fast pass if not the lines are really long. Great food also",
          "Just a great family time. Incredicoaster was our favorite. The cars ride was awesome too!",
          "It's always great to be here!  But there was a cold spell in January 2020 making it not so pleasant.  Be sure and use Fast Passes to get in the best things of the day!",
          "My entire family loved this park! Even more than Disneyland! The lines are out of control like any Disney park. Don't waste your money on the Maxpass. It's a waste of money.",
          "It is just as Magical as Disneyland, but with a dash for California spirit. Adults can have drinks and kids can come play, it's great for everyone.",
          "Everything is well done, nice workers, etc.... but we were there 3 days ago, by the evening nearly all of the rides malfunctioned. We specifically took time to get fast passes for the Cars ride and the rollercoaster earlier in the day. \u2026",
          "I remember when it was a parking lot.\nI like the variety, yet the commercialism, not so much.\nIf Google would allow it, I'd give 5-stars to the staff, and over-all cleanliness. The \"empty\" star, yeah, just like my comment on the older park, mainly because of pricing.",
          "I LOVE IT! It is very old fashioned and super cute! All of Walt Disney's Ideas are super cute!",
          "We had an excellent time with our children and grandchildren at Disneyland and the California Adventure Park. I would recommend the fast pass or single rider lines.",
          "The park is amazing and everybody can go on most of the rides in the park. Most of the  ride lines are very long so it is worth it to buy a max pass. The rides are very far, and there is a lot of walking so make sure to were good walking shoes. Other than that, make sure to have fun!",
          "The happiest place on Earth what else could you say about anything Disney has their hands on what a wonderful day we experienced in California Adventure",
          "Disney California adventure is place full of rides and fun. Therefore, it is suitable for older kids( 10+). My nephews loved it, and they enjoyed their time. It is better to stick with the rides that included in the max pass ( and came back \u2026",
          "I had gone during the Halloween season, and went to the new Cars area. And Disney did not disappoint. The area was great in detail and Disney outdid themselves on creating a Halloween theme throughout the park.",
          "Not as good as Disneyland itself, but it's been improving over the years and has my favorite rollercoaster of all time. The Cars-oriented ride is especially great, though the lines are omg-long (so go early!). The nightly water show is \u2026",
          "Always a good time!  Don\u2019t eat downstairs outdoor patio at Lamplight, it\u2019s just gross, so dirty. Ask for The Office if you have a large group for lunch at Lamplight. Can\u2019t wait for Marvel area to open! Last bottle of Fairytale!",
          "Always a fun time where it feels good to be a kid again. Maxpass option saves a ton of time from the long lines - The fast pass through the phone app is a life saver! It also allows you to save your park photos digitally. Highly recommend it! Ticket prices are still tough to swallow but you forget about that when you're there.",
          "Karl Strauss beers make for a more enjoyable experience. Glad to see local beers making it's way into California Adventure. $11 - $12.75 for the 7% beer",
          "Decided to go to California for a visit. It was my first time going here. Long line ups but what do you expect. No complains tho it was really really fun!",
          "It was an amazing experience we had lots of fun in the attractions",
          "Really fun for a day our with friends. I would recommend California adventure over the classic Disneyland park for teenagers or a group of friends. However I would recommend Disneyland for families. Using the single line really saves you \u2026",
          "Both parks are super fun, but California Adventure is so cool! The world of color was amazing!",
          "Clean and so fun deff see the world of color at night it's amazing and frozen is a theater like show its epic a must see and ride cars the ride so cool and fast",
          "First class amusement park which definitely lives up to the Disney standards. They try to have something for everyone. Disneyland and Downtown Disney are both located just outside of the front gate.",
          "It's a great place to visit until my last visit when an actor was walking across the park and people were taking pictures and asking for autographs, then I asked one of the cast members if my son could take a picture with the actor and with \u2026",
          "MY DAUGHTER TOOK ME AND MY HUSBAND AND WE HAD A VERY GOOD TIME I CAN'T WAIT TO GO AGAIN LOL",
          "Part of Disney so it's expected to be a well oiled machine of a park. Clean, efficient and excellent costumer service with great attention to detail. Guardians of the galaxy ride was probably my fave due to how wild it was. The cars land \u2026",
          "The rollercoaster is great when it's  working.  Ghirardelli ice cream and chocolate is fabulous. Soaring ride, drizzly peak, Cars all great! Not as fabulous as Disneyland... but still a fun park.",
          "A wonderful festive holiday experience for the family. My daughter and I took amazing holiday pictures by an outstanding photographer. Thank you Disney we will cherish the memories!",
          "Food and wine festival was good and decent food selection in the park for once, and family times are always good fun.",
          "Absolutely loved the experience coming here. Fast pass really helps though to get on the rides fast.",
          "It's a fun place.  More for adults compared to Disney.  The rides are awesome too.",
          "So much fun. The swinging ferris wheel was an experience. Guardian of the galaxies was a thriller. All around fun fun fun!!! Kept a smile on my daughter and husbands face.",
          "Disney done good! First time ive been for a holiday season and its nothing like you ever imagined! The beauty of the sights and sounds cant be explained. Im not normally one to gush over the sights either! Id love to come back and spend a whole week at either park!",
          "Thought the admission was a bit over-priced. Trust me, it was worth it. I really want to go back so badly. It was my wife\u2019s first visit and she literally cried when she eventually met her fav Disney character ;-). Wish we can go back in near future!! Enjoyed every single moment.",
          "I love going to Disney California Adventure this place has fun rides to go on and also meeting the Disney Pixar characters",
          "For more adventure and some more good show.. don't miss it .. to creat more fun and enjoying moments with family ...Must visit place for all.",
          "Great workers, really nice! Michael is one. Super fun and magical",
          "Love California Adventure! It's my fave park at Disneyland and will go as often as I can!",
          "Admission price is steep but you should get the Max Pass and it's worth it. Lots of fun. Bring a backpack with all the food you want to avoid buying food.",
          "Not much of a park.  A couple of creative rides but that is all.  however. best thing going is the 60 min live performance of Frozen.  Absolutely Broadway excellent!  A must see.  Singing great and Disney special effects fantastic.",
          "It is truly the happiest place on earth!!!! I absolutely LOVE it their!!!\nBest place EVER!!!",
          "Much improved since I was here 10 years ago. Worth a whole day or two alone - no park hopper needed.",
          "Five stars for rides!  Restaurant reservations are a problem though: you drop what you're doing to go check in at the restaurant for your reservation, and the host then informs you it will be ~25 minutes until you're seated (it was actually 40 minutes).  Not a good experience, especially with kids.",
          "The food festivals they have are fantastic! I love the rides and the atmosphere. The Frozen show is my favorite! I could watch it all day! The animation academy is very fun, too! Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite ride, along with the incredicoaster. Every experience is just magical!",
          "Super fun times. If you buy a dolewhip you can use a churro as a straw! \ud83d\ude03",
          "It's a magical place. Get there early. Invest in paying for preferred parking and make the most out of it \ud83d\ude0a  \nI have a 5 year old and we enjoyed the Frozen show (super professional pure  excellence in production) Disney Jr dance party , Carsland and Pixar pier.",
          "The park was amazing, and I definitely appreciated the seasonal festivities and menu options. My only critic is that I would like to see a lot more of a Halloween presence in the park at this time of year! I cannot wait for my next adventure at Disney.",
          "This is my family's favorite place! The roller coaster was super fun and it's not so crowded. I would recommend a fast pass for Radiator Spring racers. The line can be super long. The World of Color was awesome!",
          "I love this place. The Cast Members are always sweet. Especially at Toy Story Midway Maina and the Incredicoaster",
          "Amazing park! It has improved greatly since its opening.",
          "I had a great time.  Really enjoyed the corn dog",
          "Amazing! My only word of caution is if you dont like big  rides or have little ones you may want to just stay at Disneyland. But if you love big rides like me this is the place to be.",
          "I really love this place. It has gone through a lot of different changes and a lot of growth. It is really nice to see it grow and become better. The new additions and changes of rides have really improved it. I am glad that Disneyland it's making more stuff after their movies and not just California.",
          "Love this park, lots of adult options along with the children, this is a need to visit place. We go here two plus times a year.",
          "People say California adventure is amazing. 25 years ago when it first came out it had very few fun things for kids. People say now it's as awesome or even better than Disneyland. So I trusted them. Came. And my conclusion is theres very few things for children to do. No change.",
          "They have a lot of fun stuff and rides and it's not crowded a lot like Disney. You can enjoy yourself without bumping in to other people.",
          "We enjoyed our time here just as much as Disneyland! Seems smaller and less crowded, which were both pluses. Fun character viewing that are different from the ones you get at Disney. Really great ride varieties!! We love the Guardians of \u2026",
          "Festival of Holidays..... great food items. Always a crowd, but relax and focus on the food. Shrimp and  grits are great. The pork belly was good, but the rice a bit salty. Could be me, as I dont do heavy salt.",
          "The park was so much fun.  I love that it's clean and has wide open spaces.  It feels more spacious than Disneyland.  However thre Good this time,  from the Asian cuisine on the wharf was awful.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken with a side of \u2026",
          "Very fun for all ages. A recommended ride is the imcredicoaster. The fast passes recommended and very useful.",
          "Same as Disneyland but they serve alcohol. It's a preference thing. I prefer Disney.. better rides and features but both offer first class experiences.",
          "Better then the Florida theme parks in my opinion we had an ultimate experience and it was so fun I didn't wanna leave the park",
          "So nice and big, literally spend a entire day and still not finish to explore it completely.",
          "Love the California Adventure Park and all the rides there. The thing I love that they do in Disney parks that they don't in Universal is all the rides are actual authentic rides not 3D simulation rides. Simulation suck and Disney doesn't \u2026",
          "The magic of Disneyland California Adventure is great!!  Love the rides, games and activities.   The park is vibrant, offers good food choices and variety of parades.",
          "Wow! This is our first time here!  World of Color was so cool!  Drawing characters with Disney animators was one of our favorite things. The Frozen performance was like something you'd see on Broadway.  Radiator Springs Racers were amazing at night!  Wonderful park!",
          "So much fun packed into one place. We love it!",
          "Had a great day with my family. Rode some fun rides, ate good food and watched an amazing nighttime show. Would love one more day.",
          "This place is great but lacks rides. Needs less shops and more rides. Right now they have 2020 Chinese New Year merchandise available.",
          "Everything is really spread out. The new guardian's ride is amazing, probably the best one at the park.  But the wait lines are killer.",
          "Wow! The Frozen show, the rides, character greets, and the world of color makes this park amazing! Definitely not as good as Disneyland, but still very fun!",
          "I love this park! It's a great park in its own right with plenty of great rides (Tower of Terror, California Screamin', Soarin, Midway Mania, Cars Racers, etc.)  and great food (with alcohol!).\n\nCompared to Disneyland, it's much more open \u2026",
          "It's a magical and fun place to be, it feels like my childhood movies coming to life.",
          "Philip the host tour guide at Disneyland was amazing. He nee everything about Disneyland.  He really made our experience like no other. I hope he can see this",
          "Beautiful place good layout. Clean good rides but 3 dod keep shutting down",
          "This is truly the happyist place on earth. \n\nI wish I could live here forever. \n\nI have a legal weed vape pen and I got my sense of wonder. \n\nDisney <3",
          "Disney puts on a top notch park experience and makes every day amazing! Lines a extremely long and the fast pass is worth it!",
          "Great adventure park. Would definetly go again, got lots of shops and food and fun rides!",
          "The park,  the rides amazing.    $300 per person  for a Saturday at the park.   Disney... too expensive for your own good.",
          "Adventure Park is good for every age group. Some of the rides are thrilling",
          "Fun for the whole family!!! Came right after christmas and was not overwhelmingly busy. You can get on rides without a crazy wait time except for Incredicoster and Radiator springs. With radiator springs if your not there first thing in the \u2026",
          "The cars land its just like being in the cartoon. Radiator spring racer, omg ..Its amazing. Got on like 3 times, you can get enough.",
          "I loved the ride Ariel's Grotto because it's like, the whole Ariel movie but not watching it. Also, Cars Land was great, we came early so I saw Lightning McQueen, and when we came back to go on the main ride he was still there so maybe he \u2026",
          "I love it \ud83d\ude0d but I think you need to work more and the quality of food is not that good\ud83e\udd14",
          "I love California Adventure Park.  I'm not crazy about the drinking going on there.  This should remain a kids friendly park without kids parents getting buzzed.  I'm a regular top annual pass holder and am not happy about bringing liquor to the park.",
          "So much to do you'll have fun no matter where you go. Fun fun fun please. The happiest place on earth.",
          "Amazing! Relevant to a younger generation with pixar and marvel. Out of this world light water show.  Staff is friendly per Disney custom. Rides are great, lights are beautifull at night, its bright and fun.",
          "Outstanding as only Disney can do it.  For the first time in my recollection we encountered on at least three occasions during my two days there, three or more staff chatting together unconcerned and indifferent about asking to be of \u2026",
          "Such a fun place to bring the family! Has exciting rides, great food, and fun activities such as learning to draw cartoons. The shops are also very fun and have cute Disney, Pixar, and Marvel stuff. The Pixar and Marvel themes are present here.",
          "Fun for everyone!! Staff is wonderful,  and actually helpful.  Only Tue cost of everything is a downer.",
          "Cars Land was decorated So fun for the Halloween festivities! We felt like at this time of year we got more value for our money because it was a smaller crowd. Fun atmosphere!",
          "All of DCA was wonderful but boy, we LOVED Cars Land! The most incredible and magical time for our family. The rides were all fun (although Radiator Springs was definitely the favorite \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d). The entire atmosphere was wonderful and we \u2026",
          "Tons of fun, loved the Incredicoacter!  Not too crowded today.  Still has Holiday decorations up.",
          "DCA is a really fun park that keeps getting better.  All of the recent changes have been great, and the Marvel area will be a fantastic addition.  \n\nThe Incredicoaster is one of the best rollercoasters anywhere!  Cars Land is like walking \u2026",
          "Very crowded but a lot of fun.   Make sure you take advantage of Fast Passes.",
          "It's definitely Imagineered with Incredible detail. Cocktails, craft beers and wine are a favorite part of my California Adventure and certainly improve this park. The food is really pretty exceptional from the stands to the restaurants, \u2026",
          "From the thrill rides to the shows to all the hidden little gems in the park it's a must visit!",
          "Magical place. My kids loved New Year's Eve in the park. Wonderful way to harken in 2020.",
          "A more relaxed environment.  Great restaurants,  with adult beverages,  Cars Land was amazing.",
          "Awesome experiences for the whole family.  From the incredicoaster, to soaring over the world, there is something for everyone.  Maxpass makes it even better to get the fastpass on mobile and schedule one every 90 min or so.",
          "Love It! Best rides. Great place I liked Disneyland but this was better",
          "Love the food festivals and the overall Disney experience. Great for people watching.",
          "The place is clean and beautiful. What made it great was experiencing it with my family.",
          "Nothing to say!  I love Disneyland and California Adventure Park.   Make sure watch the disney movies before you go .   Especially the kids they get more excited !   Its truly the happiest place !",
          "It's an adults \"Happiest place on  Earth!\" As long as you can afford it! cheers\ud83c\udf7b oh... With some pretty cool rides too! Lol!!!",
          "What a complete nightmare nothing like I remember when I was a kid. There way too many lines was shoulder to shoulder all day long Florida\u2019s experience is much better. As much as I hate to say it.",
          "Absolutely an amazing experience.  The kids loved the rides and the lady and I had a nice cold one.\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "This is an incredible place but we were waiting for the magic night show and it was cancelled  :/",
          "Super expensive. Dont open food services till 11am. Lots of walking . Good for kids only.",
          "Great fun all around and the Cars race ride is one of the best rides I have been on.",
          "Absolutely incredible!  Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite ride, but they are all so awesome!  Soaring is life altering.  Get here and don't be one of the few who are self centered and rude!",
          "What can I say? It's DCA, it's great, always have a great time. I really enjoy all the festivities they have year round.",
          "It's pretty, but not many rides for the price - and they shut them all down for a 30 minute fountain display. Twice.",
          "Awesome time. Expensive bit that's what you get at a place like this, it's not worth upgrading to fast pass as that was always long.",
          "It would be much better if you could take a stroller through the waiting lines. This is very normal in the larger european themeparks. Most staff was very friendly but a few should do some sole searching on if they want to work in a park \u2026",
          "It's better than OG Disneyland because the workers seem happier here and more eager to please. They seem to enjoy helping customers. It really makes a difference when the people not only are willing to help, but are happy to. It's easier to \u2026",
          "World of color\nThe show lasts 30 minutes and if you get the fast pass access you can get right up on the rail next to the water. The signs say you will get wet which deters some people at first but it's only mist. Go for the wet zone it's \u2026",
          "Coming all the way from Philadelphia to Anaheim, Disney Califorina Adventure was for sure the best part of our California vacation. Unlike Disneyland, California Adventure provided a upbeat, Hollywood vibe with the main center and a \u2026",
          "I like the ambiance.  (Disneyland is better.)  Have an ice cream at Clarabelle's.",
          "To be honest, I twisted my ankle and bruised my hip here because some surfaces are just too smooth when it rains.\n\nThat aside, there's no way to have a bad time here!",
          "Went in January. Really not enough rides to spend all day there. You can easily ride them several times.",
          "it seems like everytime I go they've changed the rides a little. It's a living park, not a shrine.  I love that!",
          "California adventure has changed a lot. It isn't the simple wholesome park that I use to know and love. Soon Avengers will take over, and this place will be busy. Way more busy that Disneyland. Which means prices will rise, and I will miss the old days",
          "Fun time with family.  I don't think it is worth the 149 per ticket as we were able to see all attraction and ride almost all rides before 5pm.  But the photo people were amazing when getting photos with cast members",
          "Love California adventure.  Definitely recomend the rides here for older children that are tall enough for all rides. Incredacoaster, ferris wheel & radiator springs are all amazing rides. Love that you can purchase alcohol in this park as well",
          "It's great I love Pixar Pier and they have cars land and awesome stores and places to eat!",
          "Food and wine festival is a great way to snack and take a walk down Route 66.",
          "Awesome for everyone. Way too expensive but I get it.  Must go.",
          "A fun alternative to Disneyland. It has more of an  amusement park feel with the same quality of care to the details. The incredcoster is my favorite ride in either park.",
          "Went to the Oogie Boogie Bash. It was awesome. We will go again next year. The treat trails were fun. The Halloween decorations and lights really set the mood. Villains Grove was a unique experience.",
          "Brief visit this morning. Look forward to having more time soon. \nWent again today for a couple of hours. Had a great time!! Less crowded. Faster to get on rides too. Incredicoaster was amazing!!!!",
          "Great rides that are thrilling. Loved cars land! And we also really enjoyed Pixar Pier! People around us were some times drunk and we did see a few people vaping which was annoying.",
          "We love going here, the wine and food festival was good but very small portions and super long lines. We love the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride \u2661",
          "I am a big fan of Disney Parks. The weather is great yet there were delay during their pareds where the sound come first that few moments later the ppl show up and dance . I liked the Florida one but still I enjoy my time",
          "Magical place , had soo much fun, the number of you age is not important you\u2019ll automatically be -10 years old when you enter the gate \ud83e\udd23",
          "ADVENTURE IS OUT THERE! GREAT HOTEL ROOMS AND MANY MORE!\nDon't ask about the photo",
          "Absolutely amazing! The attractions are super fun, and the park is a great place for families!",
          "We didn't really know what to expect from Disney's California Adventure as we are seasoned Disney World visitors but haven't made it to the west coast until now! We weren't disappointed though as we managed to ride all of the rides we \u2026",
          "Winter time is awesome! It's not too hot and if it feels cold you just throw on a jacket. The lines are still busy but we opted for the max pass and it was a fantastic idea.",
          "A great addition to Disneyland. Love the cars ride and Guardians of the Galaxy ride. But most of all, I like the art deco, early 1920s feel of old Hollywood at the entrance of the park.",
          "Small amount of rain and half the rides are closed. Including indoor ones. Disney gave us a partial credit because we couldn't stay at the park with a cold 2 yr old and wait to see of things opened back up.",
          "Fastpass know how is essential for a one day visit.  Careful Fastpass planning will assure one the ability to hit all the high notes before World of Color closes the park.",
          "I haven't been since 2018, but like all Disney areas, this one great too!",
          "California Adventure is an absolute ball! A little more mature and spread out than Disneyland, but new locations like \"Cars Land\" and \"Pixar Pier\" are an absolute treat. \n\nI would still recommend Disneyland over California Adventure, but with Park Hopper passes it is definitely not a spot to miss!",
          "It was less crowded than Disneyland. But my family and I had fun.",
          "A great place for everything. California adventure has awesome rides!! The I credicoaster is awesomely !\u2019",
          "Just like Disneyland this place is just as fun and exciting! The vibe is different in this park as there are more things for older kids to do and see. Loved the rides!!",
          "I go mainly go for the cars ride and guardians ride. Like any park, there will be lines but fast passes are available.",
          "Clean. Friendly. Long lines. Overpriced meals. Good place to vacation but be prepared to pay.",
          "Very fun during the holidays. Incredicoaster, mission breakout, toy story midway mania, and goofies flight school are thrilling.  Cars is a fun take on a cruise and then a race.  Marvel land is progressing,  can't wait to see what the new \u2026",
          "The food here and the atmosphere is spot on. Seasonal dishes and shows are the best and during the evening the atmosphere is even better. My family loves just walking around and getting some ice cream.",
          "There is a VIP lounge at alfresco's for season pass holders besides that the wine and sip tour made the place very crowded an inconvenience for non wine and sip passholder carriers. Smokejumpers Grill by the Grizzly Peak ride is the most \u2026",
          "Pixar Pier is one of the greatest places of imagineering that Disney have ever created. From incredi-rides to breathtaking shows, this by far is a work of genius. The night time show is how you do a water display - it puts certain shows in \u2026",
          "One of the best amusement parks my family and I have been to. The rides aim towards the older crowd (ages 8 and up) but there are definitely rides available with a short wait time that can be appealing to younger riders. A must do is the \u2026",
          "Star Wars was great. Kids had a lot of fun",
          "Always a great time. The reason for 4 out of 5 rather then 5 is 99% of the rides at Disneyland and Disney California have the ability to do fast pass through the app by scanning your digital ticket at the Fast Pass locations. However Toy \u2026",
          "Incredicoaster is really amazing. I would pay dollars to have an all day fast pass just for that ride alone",
          "Not anywhere near as good as Disneyland, especially for adults. The Incredicoaster, Radiator Springs, and Little Mermaid attractions were fun, but most of the other rides were really short (15 secs) that you had to wait over 30 minutes to ride.",
          "It's a cherry on top if you can get this park included with Disneyland entry, so check the block dates. A lot of fun.",
          "If you are a Pixar fan or love the atmosphere of a bustling place like Hollywood, I would recommend you give the Disney California Adventure Park.",
          "If I could give California Adventure 10 Stars, I would! What an amazing place. Watched the Water musical: \"World of Color\" all I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I am sure Walt is proud! Thanks for a near perfect day!",
          "I love this place! The music in the Hollywood area is cool, the buildings and details are amazing! Cast members are nice. There are plenty of places to go cool off and sit down. Food choices are plenty!",
          "Traveled from Colorado and had a blast with my family. Do recommend getting their early to obtain the fast pass tickets if possible, lines are pretty long but worth the wait. In my opinion, the rides at Disney California Adventure are more thrilling than Disneyland.\nMy favorite ride was Guardian of the Galaxy! First timers. Good luck!",
          "Enjoy that they have beer on this side. Lots of options. Even Michelob for the keto people like me. Try it with the spicy rim. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "It was amazing! The details are incredible. The lines on many of the rides are so thought through that they become part of the ride rather than just the line.",
          "The perfect compliment to the original park.  Guardians of the Galaxy and the Incredicoaster are amazing rides.  Watching the sunset over Paradise Pier is also beautiful.  Plus there are wine and beer stalls.",
          "Date of visit : December 19, 2018\n\nDCA is an underrated theme park. So it was not as crowded as Disneyland.\n\nThe Frozen live show was a world class performance. It basically cover at least half of the day rates price. Singing was tops. \u2026",
          "This part of the resort is different,  in that I can enjoy just walking around or sitting to dine. Have a great and enjoyable time and forget it's supposed to be a theme park.",
          "Great for the whole family. Definitely get the hopper for this park. You will  want to go to Disneyland after spending halve your day here. I don't think is worth spending the whole day at this park. You will be able to see more of the \u2026",
          "Not a big fan of this place. It appears to be filled with eateries and beverage places. A few rides that are far apart. A plus, if you're an alcoholic, you can buy a $10 beer. And you're probably an alcoholic if you're buying ten dollar \u2026",
          "It is awesome mostly for older young teens and adults, theres alot of height recommended for young kids.",
          "We loved the food and wine festival and riding soarin over California again!",
          "Amazing place for people of all age groups. It is fun even if you don't like rides. Just experience the world they have created and live in the movies like Cars, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and many more. Totally worth it. Exorbitant price for souvenirs. You can take snacks and water with you in the park. Thanks.",
          "My first visit to Disneyland California and I had a blast! My favorite ride was Hydro space Mountain! So exciting! The Castmembers were friendly and very helpful. Already planning another visit!",
          "Like it cause lines are not as long and have beer and liquor  and people are more happy and respectful",
          "Maybe it is because I'm a Florida native and been to Disney World so many times. California Adventure was neat, but a bit underwhelming. I'm not sure what we expected, but it was not quite the Disney theme park we have grown used to. \u2026",
          "Love all that is Disney!! Transforms me into a little kid again everytime we visit... I'd quit my job and move to California if we could afford to live there and work for Disneyland.",
          "Rita's margaritas,  incredicoaster,  guardians of the galaxy and soaring over the world. The best!",
          "We always get a park hopper pass because each park (Disneyland and California Adventures) offer something unique and different. We bounce back and forth all day which makes our experience so much more fun!!",
          "It was indeed magical, but I was disappointed that most stores closed at 9 pm.\nLooking forward to seeing the Avengers stuff and coming back during the day!",
          "I was sad when I thought they closed the cove bar, but they actually re-opened it with new drinks! Great little lounge/bar overlooking Paradise Bay",
          "Amazing. All my dreams came true. Can't wait for Marvel Land",
          "Probably my favorite Disney park in the world. Cars land is amazing, the best themed area. Everything is absolutely incredible in terms of theming.",

          "Magical place indeed! Carsland is a mist see at night! beautiful!",
          "DCA was fun.  We arrived early and were escorted as a group to guardians of the galaxy ride in the morning.  The only downside was the lamplighter lounge.  The food was average.  A little disappointing considering the rave reviews.  Might \u2026",
          "Love it! A GREAT place to escape life for awhile and have fun. Something for everyone, great food, shows, characters, and emersive rides. Disney magic is the BEST magic.",
          "This was my first time here, though I've been going to Disneyland for 25 years now. It was pretty amazing. A lot better then I expected and much bigger. When I was a kid this was a giant parking lot. \n\nThis is quite a bit different then \u2026",
          "Great Experience, however if it's your first time to the parks, I'd say go to Disneyland, it's an overall better experience, however with a Park Hopper, it makes an unmatched experience as a family vacation",

          "First time at Disney California Adventure Park and it was loads of fun! I will say this park is more adult than Disney Land... Disney Land is more for the little ones, as all the rides are kid friendly. Disney California has more adult \u2026",
          "Disney California is so much fun. I highly recommend the park hopper to do both parks.",
          "I prefer this side of the park. It's Disney so expect lines but if you're there what do you expect. Lots to do but I wouldn't waste time on food. Snacking is ok and plenty of overpriced treats for the kids. Can't wait for marvel land.",
          "First, Gaurdians of the Galaxy is the coolest ride ever!!!  And for the 21+ crowd, you can drink here!  Not that you need to but its definitely more relaxed at this park than neighboring Disneyland but same great service and exceptional experience!",
          "Cars land makes me feel right at home in the American Southwest! It is stunning!",
          "Aloha! This is the best theme park ever. My kids love it and they have the most friendliest staff. The food and drinks are the best. Expensive yes but worth it. I always buy a turkey leg always whenever I\u2019m here. I love Disney!!! \ud83d\ude01",

          "Honestly, with the redo of Pixar Pier, CA adventure is arguably just as good as Disneyland these days. My 2 yo preferred it to Disneyland, but most of her favorite movies are Pixar (Monsters Inc, toy story, etc). Small note that there's not \u2026",

          "Great for kids and adults. Every area is very festive and there was alot of characters walking around. We really enjoyed the world of color christmas water show but there was a staff member that was very rude to our family about where we \u2026",
          "Fan place first time and I love  we definitely going to come back soon",
          "10/10 can recommend this. The immersion is insane. Would definitely recommend 2-3 days for both parks while using the fast pass. Using the mobile applications enhances the experience further, though they're pretty 'crash' heavy.",

          "This certainly is a magical place. So much fun.",
          "Love this place almost as much as Disneyland but still love Disneyland more. ;)  Anyway, I would suggest a park hopper for 3 days then you can enjoy the best of both worlds. Or better yet, a season pass is great!",
          "Well, Disney California has never been my favorite but since we had 4 days this time we decided to go. It\u2019s changed a little. I don\u2019t remember there being beer the last time I went, which was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the music that was playing and it was actually quite relaxing compared to the crowds at Disneyland.",
          "Beautifully designed theme park. Spacious and vibrant.  Makes you feel like you're walking into a live version of your favorite Disney animations...  Great Rides and attractions...",

          "Just like my Disneyland Park review, Where do i even begin with the awesomeness of this park. First off, this is a park that is changing a lot, so expect to see some rides in one time and then others in another. Plus, every ride is awesome \u2026",

          "There attractions are very exciting, especially the Incredicoaster. They are enjoyable for kids and adults alike, and the food is absolutely phenomenal. However, the FastPass system is not very great; it was unavailable for a few rides and had a long wait time for the others.",

        "wiki": "Anaheim () is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th-most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second-largest city in Orange County in terms of land area, and is known for being the home of the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, and two major sports teams: the Anaheim Ducks ice hockey club and the Los Angeles Angels baseball team.\nAnaheim was founded by fifty German families in 1857 and incorporated as the second city in Los Angeles County on March 18, 1876; Orange County was split off from Los Angeles County in 1889. Anaheim remained largely an agricultural community until Disneyland opened in 1955. This led to the construction of several hotels and motels around the area, and residential districts in Anaheim soon followed. The city also developed into an industrial center, producing electronics, aircraft parts and canned fruit. Anaheim is a charter city.Anaheim's city limits extend almost the full width of Orange County, from Cypress in the west, twenty miles east to the Riverside County line in the east, encompass a diverse range of neighborhoods. In the west, mid-20th-century tract houses predominate. Downtown Anaheim has three mixed-use historic districts, the largest of which is the Anaheim Colony. South of downtown, a center of commercial activity of regional importance begins, the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city, which stretches east and south into the cities of Orange, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. This edge city includes the Disneyland Resort, with two theme parks, multiple hotels, and retail district; Disney is part of the larger Anaheim Resort district with numerous other hotels and retail complexes. The Platinum Triangle, a neo-urban redevelopment district surrounding Angel Stadium, which is planned to be populated with mixed-use streets and high-rises. Further east, Anaheim Canyon is an industrial district north of the Riverside Freeway and east of the Orange Freeway. The city's eastern third consists of Anaheim Hills, a community built to a master plan, and open land east of the 241 tollway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAnaheim's name is a blend of Ana, after the nearby Santa Ana River, and German -heim meaning \"home\", which is also a common Germanic place name compound (compare Trondheim in Norway and many place names in Germany).The city of Anaheim was founded in 1857 by 50 German-Americans who were residents of San Francisco and whose families had originated in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Franconia in Bavaria.  After traveling through the state looking for a suitable area to grow grapes, the group decided to purchase a 1,165 acres (4.71 km2) parcel from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros' large Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana in present-day Orange County for $2 per acre.For $750 a share, the group formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company headed by George Hansen. Their new community was named Annaheim, meaning \"home by the Santa Anna River\" in German. The name later was altered to Anaheim. To the Spanish-speaking neighbors, the settlement was known as Campo Alem\u00e1n (English: German Field).\n\nAlthough grape and wine-making was their primary objective, the majority of the 50 settlers were mechanics, carpenters and craftsmen with no experience in wine-making. The community set aside 40 acres (16 ha) for a town center and a school was the first building erected there. The first home was built in 1857, the Anaheim Gazette newspaper was established in 1870 and a hotel in 1871. The census of 1870 reported a population of 565 for the Anaheim district. For 25 years, the area was the largest wine producer in California. However, in 1884, a disease infected the grape vines and by the following year the entire industry was destroyed. Other crops \u2013 walnuts, lemons and oranges \u2013 soon filled the void. Fruits and vegetables had become viable cash crops when the Los Angeles \u2013 Orange County region was connected to the continental railroad network in 1887.\n\n\n=== Helena Modjeska ===\nPolish actress Helena Modjeska settled in Anaheim with her husband and various friends, among them Henryk Sienkiewicz, Julian Sypniewski and \u0141ucjan Paprocki. While living in Anaheim, Helena Modjeska became good friends with Clementine Langenberger, the second wife of August Langenberger. Helena Street and Clementine Street are named after these two ladies, and the streets are located adjacent to each other as a symbol of the strong friendship which Helena Modjeska and Clementine Lagenberger shared. Modjeska Park in West Anaheim, is also named after Helena Modjeska.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Anaheim was a massive rural community dominated by orange groves and the landowners who farmed them. One of the landowners was Bennett Payne Baxter, who owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of Angel Stadium. He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners. He was not only successful, he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well. Ben Baxter and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community before the opening of Disneyland transformed the city. A street along Edison Park is named Baxter Street. Also during this time, Rudolph Boysen served as Anaheim's first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950. Boysen created a hybrid berry which Walter Knott later named the boysenberry, after Rudy Boysen. Boysen Park in East Anaheim was also named after him.\n\nIn 1924, Ku Klux Klan members were elected to the Anaheim City Council on a platform of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day. The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1200 members in Orange County. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were the majority of their opponents; however, the opposition to the Klan also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County who joined the Klan did so out of a sense of civic activism. Upon easily winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.The opposition to the KKK's hold on Anaheim politics organized, bribed a Klansman for their secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries, defeating most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed; its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.\n\n\n=== Disneyland and the late 20th century ===\n\nConstruction of the Disneyland theme park began on July 16, 1954, and it opened to the public on July 17, 1955. It has become one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, with over 650 million visitors since its opening. The location was formerly 160 acres (0.65 km2) of orange and walnut trees. Hotels and motels began to spread and residential districts soon followed. By the mid-1960s, the city's explosive growth would attract a Major League Baseball team, with the California Angels relocating from Los Angeles to Anaheim in 1966, where they have remained since. In 1980, the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams relocated from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the Angels' home field, Anaheim Stadium, playing there until their relocation to St. Louis in 1995. In 1993, Anaheim gained its own National Hockey League team when The Walt Disney Company founded the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. \nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported Anaheim's population as 9.3% Hispanic and 89.2% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Anaheim grew rapidly in population. Today, Anaheim has a diverse ethnic and racial composition.During the large expansion of the Disneyland Resort in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the city of Anaheim recognized the surrounding Anaheim Resort area as a tourist destination. It includes the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, the Honda Center, and Angel Stadium.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, Disney's California Adventure (renamed Disney California Adventure Park in 2010), the most expansive project in Disneyland's history, opened to the public. In 2007, Anaheim celebrated its sesquicentennial.In July 2012, political protests by Hispanic residents occurred following the fatal shooting of two men, the first of whom was unarmed. Protesting occurred in the area between State College and East Street, and was motivated by concerns over police brutality, gang activity, domination of the city by commercial interests, and a perceived lack of political representation of Hispanic residents in the city government. The protests were accompanied by looting of businesses and homes.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAnaheim is located at 33\u00b050\u203210\u2033N 117\u00b053\u203223\u2033W and is approximately 25 miles (40 km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The city roughly follows the east-to-west route of the 91 Freeway from the Orange-Riverside county border to Buena Park. To the north, Anaheim is bounded by Yorba Linda, Placentia, Fullerton, and Buena Park (from east to west). The city shares its western border with Buena Park and Cypress. Anaheim is bordered on the south by Stanton, Garden Grove, and Orange (from west to east). Various unincorporated areas of Orange County also abut the city, including Anaheim Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 50.8 square miles (132 km2), 49.8 square miles (129 km2) of which is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) of which (1.92%) is water.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city recognizes several districts, including the Anaheim Resort (the area surrounding Disneyland), Anaheim Canyon (an industrial area north of California State Route 91 and east of California State Route 57), and the Platinum Triangle (the area surrounding Angel Stadium). Anaheim Hills also maintains a distinct identity. The contiguous commercial development from the Disney Resort through into the cities of Orange, Garden Grove and Santa Ana has collectively been termed the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city.\n\n\n=== Communities and neighborhoods ===\n\nDowntown Anaheim is located in the heart of the Colony Historic District. Downtown is the administrative heart of the city where City Hall, Anaheim West Tower, Anaheim Police Headquarters, the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce and the Main Library are located. Anaheim Ice (formerly Disney Ice), the Downtown Anaheim Farmer's Market, a food hall in a historic 1919 Sunkist packing house, and the Center Street Promenade are also located in Downtown Anaheim. In late 2007, The Muzeo, the newest major museum in Orange County, opened its doors for the first time and is located next to Anaheim West Tower. Pearson Park is also located in Downtown Anaheim, and is named after Charles Pearson, who was Mayor of Anaheim during the time Walt Disney opened Disneyland in Anaheim. One of the major attractions located in Pearson Park is the Pearson Park Amphitheater. In the Colony Historic District just west of Downtown Anaheim is the Mother Colony House, which was built by George Hanson and was the first house built in Anaheim, the founder of Anaheim. Today, it is Anaheim's and Orange County's oldest extant museum. The Woelke-Stoeffel House is a Victorian mansion located next door to the Mother Colony House. Originally the Victorian Home was occupied by the Stoeffel family, early pioneer residents of Anaheim. The home served as headquarters for the local Red Cross until the early 1990s. In 2010\u20132011, the Woelke-Stoeffel house became refurnished and is now part of the Founder's Park complex. Founder's Park includes the Mother Colony house and a carriage house, which serves as a museum of Anaheim's agricultural history.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many other South Coast cities, Anaheim maintains a Subtropical Mediterranean climate Csa, enjoying warm winters and hot summers.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Anaheim had a population of 336,265.

Team spokesmen pointed out that from its inception, the Angels had been granted territorial rights by Major League Baseball to the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino in addition to Orange County. The new owner, Arturo Moreno, believed the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County. The \"of Anaheim\" was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that \"Anaheim\" be included in the team's name.\nMayor Curt Pringle and other city officials countered that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises, Inc., then the ownership group for the Angels. They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation, but provided very little revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball LP in Orange County Superior Court, and a jury trial was completed in early February 2006, resulting in a victory for the Angels franchise.\nAnaheim appealed the court decision with the California Court of Appeal in May 2006. The case was tied up in the Appeals Court for over two years. In December 2008, the Appeals Court upheld the February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of Angels Baseball. In January 2009, the Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case any further, bringing an end to the four-year legal dispute.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\nAnaheim was, at one point in time, one of the most politically conservative major cities in the United States. However, in recent years it has been moving leftward. According to the California Secretary of State, as of October 22, 2018, Anaheim has 141,549 registered voters. Of those, 58,411 (41.27%) are registered Democrats, 39,885 (28.18%) are registered Republicans, and 37,877 (26.76%) have declined to state a political party/are independents.\n\n\n=== City government ===\n\nUnder its city charter, Anaheim operates under a council-manager government. Legislative authority is vested in a city council of seven nonpartisan members, who hire a professional city manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The mayor serves as the presiding officer of the city council in a first among equals role. Under the city's term limits, an individual may serve a maximum of two terms as a city council member and two terms as the mayor.\nUp until 2014, all council seats were elected at large. Voters elected the mayor and four other members of the city council to serve four-year staggered terms. Elections for two council seats were held in years divisible by four while elections for the mayor and the two other council seats were elected during the intervening even-numbered years.\nIn response to protests and a California Voting Rights Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and several residents, the city placed two measures on the November 2014 ballot. Measure L proposed that council members be elected by district instead of at large. Measure M proposed to increase the number of council seats from five to seven. Both measures passed.The current city council consists of:\nMayor Harry Sidhu (since 2018)\nDenise Barnes, District 1 (since 2016)\nJordan Brandman, District 2 (since 2018)\nJose F. Moreno, District 3 (since 2016)\nLucille Kring, District 4 (since 2012)\nStephen Faessel, District 5 (since 2016)\nTrevor O'Neil, District 6 (since 2018)\n\n\n=== Federal, state and county representation ===\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Anaheim is split among three Congressional districts:\nCalifornia's  39th congressional district, represented by Democrat Gil Cisneros,\nCalifornia's  45th congressional district, represented by Democrat Katie Porter, and\nCalifornia's  46th congressional district, represented by Democrat Lou Correa.In the California State Senate, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  29th Senate District, represented by Republican Ling Ling Chang,\nthe  34th Senate District, represented by Democrat Tom Umberg, and\nthe  37th Senate District, represented by Republican John Moorlach.In the California State Assembly, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  65th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Sharon Quirk-Silva,\nthe  68th Assembly District, represented by Republican Steven Choi, and\nthe  69th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Tom Daly.On the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Anaheim is divided between two districts, with Anaheim Hills lying in the 3rd District and the remainder of Anaheim lying in the 4th District:\n\n3rd, represented by Donald P.

To minimize the impact on customer bills, undergrounding is taking place slowly over a period of 50 years, funded by a 4% surcharge on electric bills.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nIn 2003, Anaheim reported nine murders; given its population, this rate was one-third of the national average. Reported rapes in the city are relatively uncommon as well, but have been increasing, along with the national average. Robbery (410 reported incidents) and aggravated assault (824 incidents) rank among the most frequent violent crimes in the city, though robbery rates are half of the national average, and aggravated assaults are 68% of the average. 1,971 burglaries were reported, as well as 6,708 thefts, 1,767 car thefts, and 654 car accidents. All three types of crime were below average.

The Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), and the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 241) also have short stretches within the city limits. Also, SR 90 and SR 39 run through the city as regular streets.\nAnaheim is served by two major railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Knott's Berry Farm is a 57-acre (23 ha) theme park located in Buena Park, California, owned and operated by Cedar Fair. In 2018, it was the twelfth-most-visited theme park in North America and averages approximately 4 million visitors per year. The park features 40 rides including roller coasters, family rides, dark rides and water rides.\nThe theme park began in the 1920s as a road-side berry stand run by Walter Knott along State Route 39 in California. By the 1940s, a restaurant, several shops, and other attractions had been constructed on the property to entertain a growing number of visitors, including a replica ghost town. The site continued its transformation into a modern amusement park over the next two decades, and an admission charge was added in 1968. In 1997 the park was sold to Cedar Fair for $300 million, just two years after the Knott's food business was acquired by Conagra, Inc. in 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nThe park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning in the mid 1920s, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.\" The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \"summer-long county fair.\"\n\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico Log Ride (the original name of the Timber Mountain Log Ride) opened in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there. According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00e9fense:\n\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes, Roaring Twenties rethemed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales. Then with the northward expansion of a 1920s-era Knott's Airfield themed area featuring the Cloud 9 Dance Hall, Sky Cabin/Sky Jump and Motorcycle Chase steeplechase roller coaster above the electric guided rail Gasoline Alley car ride.Sky Tower with the illuminated \"K\" in logo script at the top was built to support two attractions, the Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. The Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. Its ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. It is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+ mph or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\nMotorcycle Chase, modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together. One or two riders straddled each \"Indian motorcycle\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \"the road\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value. Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be rethemed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles themed to look like soap box racers, each seating two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980.\nMotorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed in 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Calico Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \"Urban Cowboy\" era. The \"Calico Barn Dance\" was featured in Knott's TV commercials.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\n\nKingdom of the Dinosaurs (1987) (primeval retheme of Knott's Bear-y Tales)\nCalico River Rapids (former Bigfoot Rapids, 1988), a whitewater river rafting ride as the centerpiece of the new themed area Wild Water Wilderness.The Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\nMystery Lodge (1994), inspired by General Motors \"Spirit Lodge\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper's ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia. Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests \"move inside\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\n\n\n=== New owners ===\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.In 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Inc, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.In 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\n\n\n=== Cedar Fair era to present ===\n\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed. Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.On May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gliders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Coast rider and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gliders and Pacific Scrambler. The HangTime roller coaster was also celebrated for apart of the Boardwalk expansion.\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major six-month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.\n\nDuring the fall of 2019, Knott's Berry Farm announced the return of Knott\u2019s Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair 4D dark ride.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Annual park events ==\n\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from a Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough. He dressed up in a gorilla suit and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly. During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \"haunted house\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \"scare zones\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scattered\u2014often hidden out of view\u2014throughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer. Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal, although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years. During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.Season of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \"solace\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\nA Christmas event known as \"Knott's Merry Farm\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented for many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n== Current areas and attractions ==\nThe park consists of four themed areas:\n\nGhost Town\nFiesta Village\nThe Boardwalk\nCamp Snoopy\n\n\n=== Ghost Town ===\n\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Calico River Rapids (former Bigfoot Rapids), still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \"Twenty Mule Team\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainments\u2014during \"Knott's Merry Farm,\" two small productions of \"The Gift of the Magi\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \"genuine illegal hitchin'\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History \u2013 Ghost Town \u2013 Calico' section above. The park formerly featured a 5th area called the Wild Water Wilderness. Formerly known as Wild Water Wilderness, now part of Ghost Town, that features two major rides: the Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008 and Calico River Rapids which opened in 2019. Nearby Pony Express is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\n\n\n=== Fiesta Village ===\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci\u00f3n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\n\n\n=== The Boardwalk ===\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the place of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.\nThe world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550 m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\n\n\n=== Camp Snoopy ===\n\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children's rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \"Peanuts\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Rapid River Run, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilling rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relatively tame.\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy received a makeover for its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm opened up new rides in Camp Snoopy.The 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge Grand Sierra Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet. As part of the 30th Anniversary makeover, the train ride received a series of Peanuts vignettes made by Garner Holt Productions) along the track and narration by the character Linus.\n\n\n=== Indian Trails ===\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance.\n\n\n=== Public area ===\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.\n\n\n==== East property ====\n\nThe east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.\n\n\n== Former attractions ==\n\n\n=== FearVR: 5150 controversy ===\nFor Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm introduced FearVR: 5150, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness. The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients. The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined \"a danger to themselves or others\". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\". In response, Cedar Fair removed \"5150\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut. A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\".\n\n\n== Knott's Soak City ==\n\nKnott's Soak City is a water park. It opened in June 17, 2000 as Soak City U.S.A. It requires separate admission from Knott's Berry Farm. In addition to the water park across the street from the main theme park, Cedar Fair also formerly owned two satellite Knott's Soak City Parks, in Palm Springs and Chula Vista.\n\n\n== Private police force ==\nFor much of the park's early history, Knott's Berry Farm had a unique arrangement with the Orange County Sheriff Department where the park's security officers were sworn special deputies vested with full police powers. The Security Department, however, did not answer to the county sheriff, but rather to the park's Chief of Security (who for many years was Steve Knott, the grandson of Walter Knott). Knott's Berry Farm maintained a completely private police force, vested with full police powers, and overseen by park management.\nBefore the City of Buena Park was incorporated, Knott's Berry Farm's Security Department even provided police services to the nearby unincorporated area that would eventually become known as Buena Park, including writing traffic tickets. Then, in the early days of the incorporated City of Buena Park, Knott's Berry Farm Security provided vital mutual aid assistance to the Buena Park Police Department (formerly Buena Park Public Safety) during emergencies since Knott's Berry Farm's 34 sworn Special Deputies outnumbered, and were better equipped than the city's four-man Department of Public Safety.The Orange County Sheriff Department discontinued this arrangement in the late 1980s but Knott's still maintains its own private (albeit un-sworn) security force, and its \"Station-K\" public safety radio designation.\n\n\n== Food products ==\nThe J.M. Smucker Company continues to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family; however, other products, such as the syrups, have been discontinued due to low demand.In November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their \"Berry Market\" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all-natural. They are unable to use \"Knott's\" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.\n\n\n== Public transportation ==\nKnott's Berry Farm can easily be accessed by public transportation. Service is available by the Los Angeles Metro, the Orange County Transportation Authority, and Anaheim Resort Transit. Bus routes serving the park include Metro Express Line 460 which provides direct express service between Downtown Los Angeles and Disneyland OCTA bus routes 29, 38 and 529 and Anaheim Resort Transit route 18.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSummer School starring Mark Harmon and Kirstie Alley. Mr. Shoop (Harmon) takes his band of under-achieving students on a field trip to Knott's Berry Farm (among other places) instead of teaching them.\nIn episode 13 of The Big Bang Theory, \"The Bat Jar Conjecture\", (first aired April 21, 2008) character Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) informs the group that seasoned physics bowl competitors Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, and McNair won't be forming a team for the year's competition as the group had formed a barbershop quartet and \"got a gig playing Knott's Berry Farm\", thus paving the way for the show's characters to achieve victory.\nKnocked up starring Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl. The film's opening sequence shows several shots of Knott's Berry Farm and characters in the film riding several attractions in the park.\nFuture entertainers: Christian author Stormie Omartian, comedian Steve Martin, the creator of Las Vegas \"Legends In Concert\" and the worldwide impersonation empire; John Stuart, and Kathy Westmoreland (back-up singer for Elvis Presley); actor Dean Jones all worked at the Birdcage Theater.\nIn Season 4, episode 18, of the sitcom, I Love Lucy, Fred asks if they are still going to Knotts Berry Farm that day. \n\n\n== Attendance ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOld Maizeland School a California Historic Landmark (No.729) at Knott's Berry Farm\nDisneyland\nSix Flags\nWalt Disney World\nSeaWorld\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKnott's Berry Farm at the Roller Coaster DataBase",

          "This place is awesome. Great rides for both kids and adults. Not too crowded, and not too pricey to get in. First came here as a kid, and now as a 35 year old man with a 9 year old daughter, we come here every year for the past 4 years and it holds a special place in my heart.",
          "Knott's has always been a favorite amusement park of ours. It was the first time we've been able to ride all the big stuff with our daughter. Once they are tall enough, it sure is a wonderful game-changer. We were there for Knott's Merry Farm and stayed from open to close. The",
          "You spend the day in long lines handle by not well trained employees that take their time loading people into the rides. They do it so slowly that you want to just leave, kids get bored and frustrated, the ride is fewer than 5 minutes and they wait in line for at least 50",
          "Visited here in August and it\u2019s the best theme park I have ever been to. Friendly, lines not to long. Reasonable food prices. The best ride is the wooden roller coaster but I am old school. Next is the x celebrator. Any fantastic place not to be missed in LA",
          "We planned a trip to California and wanted to start with a good theme park with some good rides for teenagers. Knotts Berry Farm certainly fit the bill. There's a great mix of rides, from the gentle railroad to the very wetting log flume and rapids. A real highlight was the",
          "We took our 11 year old son and he loved it. There are lots of rides and trains for toddlers and young children. Yes, it was crowded and food is expensive, as in all other amusement parks in CA. We paid $20 for parking which is a little bit confusing trying to find the parking",
          "At first our experience with Customer Service over the phone was bad. But eventually, we were assisted by someone there named Sabrina. She is a true professional. I hope her bosses see her value. Any future referrals or business that Knotts recieves from me and my family will be",
          "Fun place to take the kids. The prices are a lot more reasonable than Disneyland and the food was less expensive. The rides had signs which help select the rides that were appropriate for the kids. The only downside was the lack of signage to access the parking lot.",
          "Full of Christmas spirit!! The shows are all about the holidays. The music and costumes are just beautiful. Surprisingly, Christmas Eve day has less crowd. Shorter lines on the rides.",
          "Knotts Berry Farm was the clearest memory of mine when I visited as a child. Returning almost 60 years later, I still like it. We had 5 adults and 13, 9, and 3 year olds. While the atmosphere might be geared towards younger children, some of the rides are pretty wild. Prices are",
          "We have loved Knotts for 50 years. During the Christmas season, the park pulls out all the stops with beautiful decorations, festive shows and meaningful heartfelt acknowledgement of faith and the nativity. It is a breath of fresh air to enjoy all the fun of the holiday season",
          "My husband and I have been going top Knott's berry farm for about 20 years. It's a Pre Christmas getaway for us. We always have a great time at Knott's. We love Christmas & enjoy all their beautiful decorations, holiday lights/events, the rides and the staff's politeness,",
          "From the beginning, don't use the google maps to get there. Figure out where you will park first. Or park nearby and walk. Took us over an hour to go through the park around the back to all-day parking. Once inside the lines were very long so we did not go on any. We did enjoy",
          "If you are a fan of amusement parks this one is one to check out. I prefer this experience over Disneyland for price and crowd size. The rides are fun, the atmosphere is festive. It's a smaller park in comparison to some but for the limited space they pack a lot in.",
          "I loved it, mainly because the rides are much faster than I am used to in the UK. Would be great if they incorporated a single rider lane.",
          "Fantastic place to visit for extreme rides. Lots to see and do, even if you don\u2019t like the rides. Cool historical buildings and information throughout the park.",
          "Knots is by far the best value for the money compared to other SoCal amusement parks. The ability to enjoy time with family and experience the rides is perfect for those with young families.",
          "Good luck trying to get a live person because their customer service sucks! It is in need of upgrades and cleaning! Food all over the place. All I have to say is time for a remodel of the place! That same spider web is there from when I was a young child!",
          "We brought our kids ages 3 and 1 here with family over Thanksgiving weekend and had a great visit. It was nice that stroller rental was offered, which we did partake in. We arrived around 4pm and got to take advantage of a price reduction on tickets after 4pm by $30. The lights",
          "It was an excellent ride. It's very extreme so if you don't like extreme things it;s not for you but it is a great ride.Sorry for people writing bad comments it was not an amazing ride.",
          "We took our two friends\u2019 kids 8 & 11 for their 1st visit - over 50 years since our last visit. You can still pan for gold, ride a stage coach and old train (with bandits) as well as many rides for kids of all ages. Best of all was almost no lines, beautiful Saturday weather and",
          "We spent a hot Sunday afternoon here. Plenty to see and lots to ride. Phenomenal roller coasters, my hubbie loved everyone. Not nearly as crowded as Disneyland nor as expensive.",
          "Not crowded. Knotts scary is great. Love the characters. During the day was able to ride all rides. No lines. At night longest line was 30 minutes for a haunted house",
          "It was nice to see that there weren't too much changes to the park and it more or less stayed to its origins. The Halloween decoration was quite nice and the lines were not so bad that you had to wait a long time to get in a ride. Things and places change with the times but it",
          "Very happy with Knotts Berry Farm, great park for a birthday of any age and very decent hours. Well laid out and ample rest areas for the parents. Knotts is laid by and very inviting. We very much enjoyed our visit and will return for Merry Farm and other trips in the near",
          "There is so much to do for everyone. It\u2019s good for cheap thrills. (Relatively cheap, when compared to its neighbor Disneyland) However with that being said, you definitely get what you pay for. Christmas season is my favorite, it snows and Santa is there.",
          "The day we went, there were few queues and getting on to most rides was quite quick and easy. We were able to ride some rides a couple of times and just enjoyed ducking from ride-to-ride. Staff were great, including helping us when there was an error in our tickets. The bus",
          "I have a season pass which also has the parking added. I have an all season souvenir bottle which means that all my drinks are free. The rides and shows are very good. You can have a great time alone or with family and friends.",
          "We went to Knotts for Labor Day weekend. (Yes, it was super busy, but we knew that going-in on a holiday weekend with a fireworks show that evening. Even with it being busy, we still had fun and the service was great) I haven't been to Knotts since I was a kid and lived closer,",
          "We decided to go here as my wife loves a theme park. They have rides for all ages. If you stay at the hotel like we did you got the park tickets for less than original. Has some of the best rides I have ever been on. Would highly recommend this place.",
          "It is ok, nothing super special in my opinion and a little overcrowded. The price of the ticket is ok. What I liked mostly was the snoopy area. Food is ok, a little expensive maybe.",
          "We went the last week of October and tickets were so much better value than Universal or Disney. The weather was lovely and we didn\u2019t have to queue all day. Food was a bit pricey but the staff were all really friendly. There are some great roller coasters but we also had fun on",
          "My 17 year old son was threatened and mugged in a less populated area (Ghost rider and guest services) at knotts scary farm, 11:30 pm He was still stunned and in shock when he made it to information, where a stranger told him to find security. He told the front desk lady , \"I",
          "I last visited Knottsberry farm in 1985 and there were a lot of animals there and now there are none. The buildings and attractions are the same. The food was rather ordinary and had the worst Hot Dog in my life. Most of the people were very friendly and we had a reasonably good",
          "Great staff , good environment for the kids , tickets are affordable . Ghost town grills best place to eat . Currently theming is for Halloween and great during the days for kids",
          "The Hangtime Coaster is a must, it literally dangles you over an edge with only a lap constraint. Montezooma's Revenge is a classic, also with only a lap constraint. I highly recommend trying both.",
          "We've been to Knotts several times, during non-events and always found the Fast Lane to be a tremendous value by how many rides we're able to do. I saw reviews that the Scary event is very crowded, so purchased the Fright Lane pass. We were able to get on some rides with a",
          "I had a great experience at Knotts during a quiet visit. Food is ridiculously priced! Rides are great and I still enjoy this park compared to larger more commercial offerings!",
          "What a fun place! It is larger than I expected with some CRAZY thrilling rides! I did not purchase the fast pass, but on a weekend or popular day would definitely be worth it. I used my hotel parking and walked to Knott\u2019s which was a great choice because the parking was PACKED.",
          "We had been attending Scary Farm for years but moved away and had to come back for the adventure again, and being my granddaughters. We were not disappointed, I dont think you can just call them mazes anymore. Each one is such an experience. They are so creative and did there",
          "Visited SoCal with a small group of teenage Girl Scouts. We planned to visit several venues and Friday was reserved for Knotts. I haven't been to this park for over 30 years, growing up with Knotts primarily as a berry farm and Mrs. Knott's restaurant with a ghost town and train",
          "Took grandsons to Knotts for weekend and paid $90 each for fast lane passes only to discover some rides DONT offer fast lane. Many of the fast lanes were as backed up as the regular lines. They over sell and fail to explain some rights dont offer fast lane. $90 rip off",
          "Don't go to their Halloween event, it's over priced and over sold, making for an unpleasant experience in the park. Compared to the scare mazes you find across Europe, the ones at Knotts were below average. Great by day, but just avoid their Halloween event.",
          "What a great scary time we had - lines were long but manageable. Mazes thrilling and quite long so lots of time to get some good scares. Street scares were great, add to this lots of smoke and the darkness makes for a really entertaining evening. Best scare park we have done",
          "Highlight of the park is definitely the Ghost Rider. This wooden coaster has been refurbished and is now faster than ever. Another not to be missed ride is Hangtime. The newest addition to the park, this ride is amazing.",
          "What a blast! We went there not having a clue about what to expect. It had been years since my last visit, and it was a completely different amusement park back then. We were two middle aged couples, just looking for something different to do in Southern California. We had no",
          "We spent three hours here until closing on a Sunday night, plenty to see and do, loads of food and drinks options. Not to many queues. Or at least the night we went, I think one roller coaster we waited 15 minutes, that was the longest wait. Worth a look, we stayed next door and",
          "We decided to take a family trip and came here. We were lucky as it was not crowded and we didn\u2019t have to wait in long lines. We were here during the Halloween festival, but didn\u2019t get to enjoy scary farm. We had a great time though.",
          "We went to Disney, however looking for other options, we find this park, we were surprised.... amazing facilities and games, nothing to envy to other parks. Excellent ratio quality-price. Less crowded = more fun.",
          "I went here the day after Disneyland and was already on a high. In truth, this park is more of an adrenalin thrill with its rides than anything and I absolutely loved it. I think I went on every single level 5 ride multiple times. Again, the wait was very minimal, the park was",
          "i loved going there we had the time of our lives would go again. one of our favorite rides was the ghost ride.",
          "This was my first visit here. The park was very quiet today. Most rides were a walk on which could be because we are coming off a holiday weekend. This park has some incredible coasters! These coasters are intense but the ride is smooth. My head did not knock around. My two",
          "cool spooky environments - fun scary mazes - scary zombies- lines for rides were a bit too crowded during halloween",
          "We visited mid week late August and we had a blast!! My 2 older boys, 12 and 9 loved all the roller coasters, while my 3 year old really enjoyed the lil kids area. Since the local schools started, we had the park to ourselves. No line ups for any of the rides. We will be",
          "We have visited KBF numerous times over the years. However, it seems to get better as the kids are more teenagers. The rides are adventurous and fun. The California history is a hoot and not anywhere as crowded as D-land",
          "Knott's has family fun for all ages and abilities. The biggest drawback is waiting in line for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and no shade canopy or misters. The shops are full of fun gift ideas and even some affordable trinkets. We recommend this as a family outing but",
          "I went with my daughter, son in law and two grandchildren (ages 5 and 7). There was something there for all of us, especially the children. The park was beautiful and immaculate. There were flowers everywhere and plenty of wide spaces for walking and using strollers or",
          "Knott's is a fun time with many great rides but when you compare it to \"D.L.\", there is no comparison. Yes it is a special place to take the family which I advise you to do but some areas they need improving is their staff. They were not the friendliest and parts of the park",
          "The park is super nice and generally well run, except for Fast Lane. Imagine paying a whopping $90 to cut the lines. I had one day to go to Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, and was determined to hit as many rides as possible so I coughed up the extra $90. My day coast $175, before food, Just",
          "We have annual passes and love it. Great place to visit and affordable. Everything is close and they have good food.",
          "We had just planned on having dinner and had reservations but figured since we were there, we might as well take our granddaughter on a few rides. We managed one ride before dinner in Camp Snoopy. The dinner at Mrs. Knotts Chicken Dinner Restaurant was good but very expensive.",
          "Have visited numerous theme parks but none felt as genuine as Knott\u2019s. The place appears very authentic and it shows that the place wasn\u2019t put together overnight but has been done so with love for decades. We are visitors from Asia and Knott\u2019s is on a must visit every time we",
          "Another great day at Knott's with my babe. Awesome time, an unbeatable value, and quality time with my love. See you in Sept/Oct for the Haunt!",
          "Lines where long i was sorta impatient but i was able to go on some rides. The scariest ride was supreme scream and the xelerator that i did not go on. Very fun there you should go there some time.",
          "We bring friends from other states and foriegn exchange student. Great theme park for all ages. Have been going for over 30 years with my family. A must do while in Ca",
          "Not our first time there, though I noticed that each time I've been there, the overall cost has increased at a faster rate than my income (though not as badly as the nearby house of the mouse). Still. no one should go to a big amusement park expecting not to pay top dollar for",
          "A relatively small amusement park (still full of things to do). There are some good roller coasters. Wild West Complex is lovely. Opposite a good and relatively large water park with lots of facilities. Overall worth the ticket price, recommend doing a ticket to Los Angeles from",
          "I haven't been here in years, but still a lot of fun. They have a quite a bit that is no longer the Wild West, but still enjoyed exploring the old town, talking with Sad Eye Joe, visiting the school house and blacksmith. It's an interesting recreation. The rides were a lot of",
          "Now just a discounted version of a theme park. Knotts has not kept up with the higher tech and themed rides at Disney and Universal.",
          "We visited as a family of 6. Three teenagers & one 5 yo. We had a great day. First Monday of back to school so not too busy. We all stuck together for first few hours... did thrill rides & parent swopped which worked well. We then took little one to camp snoopy whilst teenagers",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here. Lots of rides, and with the fast pass we did everything multiple times. They do tend to attract a lot of school groups, which can add to the crowds. But what theme park doesn\u2019t? There\u2019s something for everyone, from the little ones, to thrill",
          "If you are going for the day and not from the area, consider upgrading to fast lane passes. You get to ride most rides while others are waiting in long lines. The rides are more tailored for above 48 inches height. There is are two rides that you need to be 52 inches to ride.",
          "Definitely something for everyone! We were unlucky that some of the rides were closed the day we were there and this was extremely disappointing. That said, the rides that we were able to go on were brilliant. As expected, food was extremely expensive as were the beverages.",
          "This is a pretty awesome place to go if you love roller coasters. I would say if you don't love roller coasters, don't go. I would also say don't go if you can't afford a fast pass. The lines here are very very very long. I don't mind waiting for some things, but waiting in line",
          "Easy park to get around. Great variety of food locations. Very clean park. Great rides for little kids and bigger kids. Lots of roller coasters. Great deal on all day pop refill bottle. Friendly and helpful staff. Great shows.",

          "Recently visited Knott\u2019s for a birthday. Waiting times for lines for coasters were good. Staff was friendly. Lots of fun.",

          "Accidentally bought tickets online for the water park, but bought food voucher for the theme park. Visited customer service to make the exchange but they gave us a hard time. This was no cheap day trip! Tickets for a family of 6, plus meal plan for 6 was not worth it. We went",
          "Great value...lots of great rides for my 12 year old Grandson. He enjoyed the rides more than Disneyland. A very clean park with domething for all ages.",
          "My grandson, age 16 and my granddaughter age 10 both have season passes and love to go here with friends. Grandson is old enough to drop off with his buddies in the morning and pickup when the place closes. There is a line of parents cars every night at closing picking up",
          "Not a lot for our kids. We were super disappointed. There were Three different times that the rides broke down on us, after waiting over an hour in line. I could be biased because we are a Disney loving family, but we will not be returning with younger kids. There were very few",
          "Had a great time with family at Knotts Berry yesterday... we splashed out for the fast-passes. If you are to visit whilst on holiday with your family, I strongly suggest you invest in a fast pass, yes they are expensive, BUT, we managed to get on every coaster at least twice.",
          "Perfect Theme Park! You could easily spend two days here if you visit the water park as well. We just went back for our second visit - only one day, but it was a full day. We showed up before park opening and waited for rope drop. At opening, I took the younger kids (6 & 12) to",
          "I loved it there, but it was super crowded the day we went. It was hard to do anything and hot. We went back the next day and was better but still crowded. Enjoyed it other than the crowd.",
          "Loved Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. Although it is a theme park it was not as overwhelming as most are. The lines were not ridiculous although they do offer fast passes. It was truly family fun. They have rides for adults and teens as well as rides for toddlers and small children.",
          "This is one of the spot to hit if you're driving from SD to LA and love thrill rides. We were so lucky that the day we went, there was no line up at all. We were only there for the afternoon. We went to LEGOLAND in the morning and drove to Knott's after our visit and we still",
          "Before yesterday, it had been nearly a decade since I'd visited this park. What a difference ten years makes!! This was by far one of the most beautifully landscaped parks I've been to in a while. The theming was outstanding, and the park was FILLED with live actors interacting",
          "Me and my wife have been coming to Knotts for the past 10 years. Always enjoy it and always have fun. Best time of the year for us is during the boysenberry festival. But it\u2019s still a fun time all year round.",
          "If you love rollercoasters then Knotts Berry Farm is ideal. Large kids area for those not big enough to ride the coasters. We really enjoyed Knotts Berry Farm with 7 kids from 3-15yrs old and will definetly go back. The hotel is awesome if you get the chance to stay, good",

          "This place is bigger than I thought it would be with a good selection of rides of varying thrill levels. There are plenty of food outlets etc, at premium prices, however the initial entry price was reasonable. The queues were very long in places sometimes as long as two hours",
          "Not worth your time or money! We had the worst experience ever at Knotts Berry Farm. We have a 5-year old daughter, so we purchased 3 fast lane tickets to skip the long lines. Unfortunately (unless you search for it yourself), the website doesn't mention that you can use fast",
          "Kids had fun on rides, lots of choices, the staff interaction with the kids is really great. The show we saw Snoopy Beach Blanket was very fun and entertaining. Plenty of places to eat, shop. Good time for everyone. Perfect weather. Price is great for a theme park.",

          "Fun park, rides wait times were a little long and park employees don't seem to be very efficient with getting people on and off rides, however the park is smaller so it's very easy to get around in. Could use some more food options in the park.",

          "This park was not on our due list while in California but I can tell you it was worth every penny. I have three kids ages 4,6,14, and they all enjoyed it. The only thing I think was a negative is that the park appears to be old and needs a lot of cleaning and repainting as some",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is the best. It is adorable and well taken care of we enjoyed everything, the food, the rides, the shows and the atmosphere. I totally recommend going and I can't wait to go again.",
          "I attempted to purchase tickets online two days prior to arriving to the park. Because I will not be arriving, I called the admissions number to pay for the stay in full ... two days at the hotel and two day/two park admission tickets ... and I was told that it would be a two",
          "This is a great amusement park, especially with small kids. Disneyland is really difficult to truth all over the park because it is so large and lots and lots of people. I feel that small children get lost easier and busy early. Knottsberry farm is a smaller park with a healthy",
          "I haven't been here before, so I decided for my birthday this year to try something new and chose Knotts Berry Farm since the price was perfect ($53 a ticket) and they do have some adult roller coasters that are on par with competitors. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a great time here,",
          "It\u2019s an ok park. Staff doesn\u2019t seem to want to work or enjoy being there. Good selection of rides, but wish they had the wait times by the lines. You can download an app, but when the park is crowded, service is a struggle. Good food throughout the park.",
          "This has gone from one of our favourites to a nemesis frankly !!! Why ?? we visited with the family ranging from 15 to 8. We waited in line for five separate rides at over an hour and 15 minutes for each one. Once we\u2019d got to the front of the line yes you guessed it !! The ride",
          "I like Knotts Berry Farm! It\u2019s a cute amusement park, geared to the younger children / teens! It\u2019s fun! But I LOVE Knotts Scary Farm! It\u2019s is a great Halloween amusement park addition! No it\u2019s not that scary, has scary parts but for the most part it\u2019s just creepy in the",
          "We were pleasantly surprised at the park. The cowboys roamed the western side of the park, interacting with the park goers. Rides catered to teenagers who would love thrill rides to pre-teens to younger kids. All-day dining was worth the money. \"Fastpass\" very expensive, so",
          "This is the best theme park my family and I have been too! We have been season pass holders for 2 years now and we willl be coming back for many years to come !",

          "Knott's berry farm is a great place for all ages! I went on memorial day and it was crowded! It was a monday and ghost riders line took 4 hours to get through. I went once in a Thursday and in the line for Jaguar there was 12 people in front of us! We got through that tunnel so",
          "This theme park has great rides for teens....the have a good amount of rides and roller coasters. Also the old west theme is very much appreciated thru the park. There is also a good selection of rides for toddlers. Food selection is also good at this park, burgers, chicken",
          "On one of the Hottest days and at the very first few days of Summer nights we went to the Park around 6:00 after work. Great not crowded, Very HOT HOT HOT.. Had our Season passes and drink cups and... NO ICE. it was 88 degrees and NO ice !!!!",
          "The rides are great, but there should be lines for \"singles\" - There are many empty seats because when groups of people want to ride together, it often leaves a seat in a row empty and there is no effort to fill it. Meanwhile, the lines are very very long and kids are often",
          "My first time to this amusement park It was such a nice change from the other park in that area Fun rides and great food The fried chicken is a must and their smoked ribs awesome Great band playing during Summer Saturday nights",
          "We first visited here on our 1st time to the States over 35 years ago, and we were very disappointed, this was Memorial Weekend and a 3/4 attractions were not working and the Ghost/Western Town side looked jaded and dated. It was a real let down as we had happy memories from",

          "We made our first visit to Knotts Berry Farm and we had a great time. We loved the layout of the park and although it was crowded, it had a pleasant safe, fun vibe to it. We loved the Ghost town and all the period actors and we loved riding a real stagecoach. The teens loved the",
          "Didn\u2019t really get to enjoy the park due to massive number of groups of up to 50 kids in matching t-shirts overwhelming everything. Nearly an hour on the ticket line waiting for people picking up tickets for groups of school children. No Group Sales Office.....??? Bad start but",
          "If you want to go here, don't go in late May. Every 8th grade class in Los Angeles seemed to have an end of year field trip here and we got stuck in the middle of herds of misbehaved pre-teens. Definitely pay the extra money (you thought you could save) and buy a fast pass for",
          "On the day we chose to go to Knott's Berry to celebrate my son's birthday it was absolutely packed. In an 8 hour period we were able to ride 3 rides and the last one we waited over 3 hours. If you can afford the fast pass then I would suggest it. I could not as would've had",
          "It is good place to go not feel like you have to rush to get it all done. It is just relaxing and fun for the entire family, with rides for all ages.",
          "We took our 6 year old and he loved it. It was a smaller theme park than Disney or universal. They have a special section for the younger ones with smaller rides. We got the cup where you can get refills every 15 minutes.",
          "Went here with my bf in December. It was so lovely and there's so much to see and do. We had a great time and I want to go again to see more",
          "Most amazing ride Knott's BF has made to date. We did an opening day video on my YouTube channel Louinator59. It does not get you too wet. I hope they get to crank up the water features this summer",
          "Knotts Berry Farm is a good option if you are trying to save money, compare to Disney California Adventure, this park is more cheap and has a lot of variety of rides for teen Ages. If you buy your tickets online you save $30 compared to gate prices.",
          "My brother is a big fan of roller coasters. I don\u2019t care for them. So I wait at the exits for him. Knott\u2019s Berry Farm has a great western atmosphere. I recommend eating at the Fireman\u2019s BBQ near Birdcage Theater. The food is good and plentiful. The birdcage theater has a show",
          "If you are looking for a truly transformative premium fantasy experience like Disneyland, then this place will be disappointing. If you a looking for a small park with some unique character and no insanely long lines that does not break your budget, then this is a great place",
          "Went to Knotts on a Wednesday, place was pretty much empty... the fun was turned to 10! Barely anytime waiting in line for rides. Hangtime, Excelorator, and Ghostrider were awesome! Definitely a must see in Southern California. Great for kiddos too.",
          "I was an annual Disney Pass holder and gave up on my pass last year and decided to try out Knotts Berry Farm instead for 2 reasons 1) Lower Price Point 2) I was bored to death standing in long Disney Queues. Long Queues as a worry here as well - I guess just cant get past them.",
          "Long long long waits. Some of the rides shut down. If you visit this park after you have seen disney land this place will seem like a dump.",
          "Snoopy & the Ghostrider could almost be a crossover comic. We've been here a couple of times but I always love Knott's Berry and am happy to come back. It's got the Peanuts theming plus a good range of coasters and rides including the new Hangtime. Plus the Ghostrider is one of",
          "We found this was one of the best theme parks we've visited. We arrived when it opened, and were able to get on a lot of rides in the first 2 hours with minimal waits! The rollercoasters were awesome, and the log ride was amazing. The park was clean, staff was friendly and",
          "It was probably the right time of year to go as it wasn\u2019t school holidays but the weather was warm. If you have small children or teenagers allow a whole day but if you are a young adult probably 4 or 5 hours is enough. I got discount tickets through Ares so it didn\u2019t cost the",
          "Brought entrance ticket and fast pass combined online saved by doing this. SO pleased we did, the Fast Pass is BRILLIANT! We only had limited time and we did all the big rides only because of fast pass as it was Easter Sunday and it was busy! Ghostrider had a 120 minute wait and",
          "This was our first visit to Knott's. We arrived at 10 just as it was opening. It was already very crowded so I was considering getting fast lane but it is so expensive that I decided against it. We got in line for Ghost Rider first which was already at a 45 min wait, which",

          "What started as a small berry farm soon began to grow into a family theme park destination thanks to famous fried chicken dinners, boysenberries and an Old West Ghost Town. Knott\u2019s Berry Farm now bursts with attractions and entertainment for all ages. This was our second visit",
          "Had a good time but rides kept breaking down causing longer lines then normal, park was clean and staff was great...Patrons were nicer then past experiences.",
          "Great place for little ones and big ones! Buy the refillable cup, we got a great deal on tix through their app. Though connection was spotty once inside the park.",
          "I was really excited to visit Knotts Berry Farm but felt so let down. Queue times were rediculous which was to be expected but 80 minutes plus with some rides having a single train wasn't good enough. Rides one after the other breaking down and staff rediculously slow at loading",
          "I usually don't like to do big rides or go upside-down so I was iffy on the park at first. It turned out better than I thought. Ghost Rider and the Sierra Sidewinder were some favorites. There were also some good shows. The Boysenberry Pot Roast was to die for.",
          "We visited Knotts Berry Farm on Wednesday April 10th. The good news was the lines were all very, very short. The bad news is we blew $300 on 4 fast pass tickets, hence the regret. I could have lived with not needing the passes because lines were so short. After all,",
          "We had a great time, but after a few hours the wait times for the rides were too long. And their fast pass is pricey.",
          "this park is hardly ever crowded, has rides for all, and it\u2019s just cute! we get our passes every year. the kids love it.",
          "I don't think anyone can compete with Disneytown. However Knott's has all those great roller coasters. Knott's has Snoopy! Knott's has the Boysenberry Festival! If you want to send a fun day riding coasters, mixing with the Peanuts gang or just snacking out on some great food,",
          "Went here for their Boysenberry Festival. So much fun. All the Boysenberry eats were delicious. The park is always decorated so beautifully. Ride lines for wait time were not bad. Most of them you could get right on. This place is so much more enjoyable than Disneyland. We",
          "Was so surprised by this amusement park. Wasn't expecting much and was amazed. Park has lots of crazy roller coasters. Also plenty of rides for young children. The day we went the most we waited on a line was a half hour. Most were only 15-20 minutes. Plan on going back next",
          "It's ZERO stars for us. First, do NOT buy fast lane unless you experienced at least 1/2 an hour wait . DO NOT BELIEVE representatives if they advice you to buy Fast Lane. We visited the park on Thursday. We had our entrance tickets already (because of the package we purchased",
          "I haven't been to this park since I was a wee lad, way too small to ride the thrill rides. I took my 11-year-old son on the trip of his life, and Hang Time was the highlight. Unreal rollercoasters, clean and tidy park, great food (Boysenberry festival!!). Can't wait to be back.",
          "Bought season passes and added fast pass this visit which was worth the extra cost. Ride wait times were average 1hour, but the fast pass trimmed that down to 2 minutes or less for most rides. Last went to Knotts in 1996, a lot has changed in a good way. Tons or fun rides and a",
          "Sometimes I love places and after they have had time to gain popularity, their services decline - this is never, ever, ever the case at Knott's Berry Farm (KBF). They continually strive to improve and invest into the park, the rides, the entertainment, the food, and the service!",
          "My family and I have been using a Go card around LA and it\u2019s been terrific. Knotts was on the list so we thought we would go there late in afternoon after spending most of day doing other things Well we didn\u2019t get off to a great start. After paying $20 to park we walked over to",
          "It was my first time at Knott's Boysenberry Festival, a seasonal event at the park, and it exceeded expectations. For $35 you can purchase a tasting card for any 8 food items. You can have multiples of a specific item as well, detach the \"ticket\" each time from your tasting",
          "Had just a few days for a quick vacation so decided to come to LA. Would have given 5 stars except with the all day dining package doesn\u2019t include a drink....wish we had know that, lady at info said it would. Getting the unlimited fast lane is a MUST!!! We would have only gotten",
          "This is particularly a review of the Boysenberry Festival, currently on until April 26, 2019. I have never seen Knotts look so beautiful. The flowers and boysenberry displays everywhere were gorgeous. We had a tasting card included with our hotel stay, so we got to have 8",
          "We had only 1 day; knowing it was peak spring break we bought the online ticket plus fast-pass early on. What I paid I feel compares to a Disney ticket; but we were able to bypass all the long lines and hop on each coaster with less than a 20 minute wait! Like any theme park;",
          "During the Knott\u2019s Barry Farm Boysenberry Festival there is an abundance of Boysenberry themed food and treats. There is the option of buying a card with 8 tabs and you can choose which foods you want to use the tabs for. We tried many but our favorite was the Boysenberry",
          "What the crap??? DO NOT GO TO KNOTTS BERRY FARM!!! My wife and I came here when we were younger and loved it so we thought it would be a great place to bring our teenage kids. This place is so ghetto now! I'm writing this as I'm standing in line for the Jaguar ride and there is",
          "Knott's Berry farm is officially my favorite place ever! The rides were very fun, especially The Ghost Rider. I would do those rides over and over again. The Ghost Rider did have some technical difficulties so we did had to wait an extra 30 minutes which made the wait time",
          "This family friendly park has something for all ages. There are kudos friendly rides all the way up to thrilling rollercoaster. The park is well maintained and ckean.",
          "I've been coming here as a kid and have always loved it. The rides are great, just would be nice to have more options for younger children. The prices are great and the food is good.",
          "Have not been here for about 8 years and had great memories of the place. Unfortunately, we did not realize some of the main thrill rides would be closed (including Silver Bullet and Xcelerator). Thankfully Xcelerator opened for a little bit and we were able to ride it, but",
          "For my birthday I decided we should spend it as a family at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm since it had been years since we had been. We lucked out as the day called for rain but it ended up staying clear until evening time. We had a great time experiencing the park with low attendance.",
          "We chose Knott's over Disney or Universal because we have young children (8 and 6), and we thought they would prefer less walking, less line time, and more rides available to them. This definitely fit the bill, and was much more affordable. Our family all enjoyed the log ride,",
          "We visited on March 22. I had bought the tickets in advance online, so that was a big savings. Also bought a meal in advance which also turned out to be a good deal (had the chicken and rib combo and received a generous amount of food). We entered the park and saw that two of",
          "Staff very polite and helpful. Great family fun, plan full day to enjoy all that is offered at the park. Plan to get there early for best parking.",
          "Was looking forward to this park for a good family day. Admission is expensive and then they want another $375.00 for fast pass, you will want it if you want to ride more than 4 rides. Three of the roller coasters were down, ghost rider when we were 65 minutes into a 2 hour",
          "My family of 7 from Arizona visited Knott's Berry Farm on March 20. Me, my husband, 18 year old daughter, and 5 boys aged 13 and under. We all loved it! There were enough child rides for the younger ones, and thrill rides for the older kids. Wait times weren't bad at all. While",
          "Lots of fun for families. However long waits in lines for the rides. No indication of how long you'll be waiting. Wait to ride time ratio must be 50 to 1.",

          "Hadnt been since i was a kid, way more rides that were very fun. Wasnt crowded which was good. Would have given an excellent rating but a tour guide pulled a really stupid move. While my family, and only my family of 5 was walking through the line to get on the log ride, a guide",
          "Was not expecting it! Great great great coasters. Waiting lines were great, no more than 30 min tops. I would really recomend this park if you want to enjoy yourself and dont spend that much time and money than other parks. SurenI will go back!!",
          "Interesting place to stroll around without taking a ride. Learn about how the park was started by Walter Knott and his wife. Spend time in the Museum and visit the replica of the Liberty Bell across the road from the Market place.",
          "Knotts berry does not disappoint. Great rides for all ages available. So happy Ghost rider was running today. Love the live shows too!",
          "Went with a 12 year old. Had a blast. Great value and ended up getting the yearly pass to come back again. Some really outrageous rides that we didn't go on, but if you are a thrill seeker this is a good place. Even without those rides we found plenty to keep us busy. Arcades",
          "We visited Knotts Berry Farm on a family trip over Spring Break. We were pleased that on a Tuesday there were not many long lines. Good facilities, clean bathrooms, decent food. The biggest draw is that there are more than 30 different rides for kids of all ages. Very fun trip.",
          "Fantastic park! A must if you\u2019re in Anaheim/Los Angeles area! Ghost Town is wonderful, the actors walking around are just incredible. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

          "Overall,fun time. However all rides were closed in the Ghost Town and there were sporadic closures throughout the park during the day. Fortunately, we went during the week so there was little or no waiting for the rides that were open. Just needed to let the guest know in",

          "Our family from 4 years old to 13 had a wonderful time. only disappointment was that a couple rides were not working that they wanted to go on, but other then that was great. Also, the boysenberry bomb pops are super yummy.",
          "Visited for the first time and I would definitely go back. If you are a coaster fan this is your place, but it has something for everyone. This park is owned by Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio, the coaster capital of the US. The lines may be long on the big attractions but that\u2019s",
          "Where else can you go with thrill rides that match the best at Magic Mountain, character and history that comes close to Disneyland and even includes stunt shows like Universal Studios? The answer is Knotts Berry Fam! We went on a Friday the longest we had to wait in line was 15",
          "So impressed how clean the park was. We did buy the fat track pass and definitely worth it! The kids had a great time. Totally suggest hitting Knott\u2019s Berry while in the area! We were in the area for hockey so that time of year the water rides are closed. Would plan a mini-vaca",

          "Our high school band performed in the morning and then played the rest of the day. Most noticed by mid afternoon they had ridden about everything. So, closing at 6pm and 1 day was perfect. They try to be accessible but somethings are still challenging. Shop doorways. And ramps",
          "This was the 1st theme park to open in the United States, and was an inspiration for Walt Disney when he built the nearby Disneyland. The park is laid out very well, and has a TON of rides for both thrill-seekers as well as many kid-friendly ones. They really have a good mix of",

Many rides didn\u2019t have a wait time posted which was odd. What appeared to be a short line turned out to",

          "Great place to go with your friends, as a couple or family. There\u2019s something to do for all ages or just people watch. They have several good and fast roller coasters and other rides also. The price is a whole lot cheaper than Disneyland especially if you can get discounted",
          "If your looking for an amusement park to visit, Knotts Berry Farm is where you should go. Lots of things to do for the young and old. They have good hours, great food, and plenty of rides and shows. If you have never been, try it! Enjoy!",
          "We were pleased to learn that Knotts Berry Farm was open during the Christmas \ud83c\udf84 Days!! We enjoyed the full day with our teenage and young adult children and our grandchildren. The day was warm and sunny and the park was not as full as usual\u2014so, the lines were short and we rode",
          "I always enjoy Knotts. The pricing is great (way better than Disneyland). The have fun rides. The crowds aren't overwhelming. The food there is really good, too. It's just an all around fun place to go for all ages. Knotts Merry Farm right before Christmas was when we went. I",
          "While Knott's Berry farm is by far my favorite amusement park in sounthern California, I was disappointed. There isn't a whole lot to do for younger kids that are too short for camp Snoopy. My 2 year old wasnt tall enough to go on anything. We just watched her brothers do it",
          "Our kids, 6 and 3 at the time, had a wonderful time! This park is smaller and has less traffic in comparison to Disneyland so it was much easier and quicker to get in. The lines to the rides were much shorter, even the lines for pictures with Snoopy and co. We only stayed within",
          "Perfect park for teens and tweens. Date night? Also great for that. We\u2019ve got passes and we got back a lot. Never too crowded, the shows are good, holidays are pretty there. They don\u2019t quite have the \u201cmagic\u201d that Disney has, but it\u2019s a much easier, less stressful day. The food",
          "From young kids to teens lots of different rides. Games to win prizes very goo also. Live shoes throughout the day. My negative is we tried coming in with Paid Go San Diego Passes but were 15 minutes late with traffic coming up from San Diego and they wouldn't honor them. Not",
          "My family and I were SO excited to visit the park on New Years Eve. That was the WRONG day to go. Had we gone any other day, the park would have been fantastic. We managed to stay for 7 hours and only made it on 4 rides. The rides we did go on were amazing though! If the park",
          "Without the Fast Lane Pass the day wouldn't have been as fun. Example: We went on GhostRider 4 times in a row in under 20 minutes. We went on Sidewinder 6 times in a row in under 20 minutes. BANG for BUCK! We enjoyed the small, home-town feel of Knott's for a 1-day trip more",
          "Had a wonderful time as they had plenty of attractions and events to accommodate children of all ages! Had never been for a holiday and would definitely visit again!",
          "This is the land of the mega-coasters. The ones that make your stomach turn in knots, and your mind bend. The screams get stuck in your craw as the G-forces make your insides turn somersaults at odds with your skeletal system. We chose to do the Silver Bullet first, and it was",
          "My biggest problem was no outside food is allowed and it\u2019s VERY expensive to eat there. 2 hotdogs, 1 fry, 1 drink $29 at wilderness broiler, and it took 40min to get that, the girl in front of us took 2 hour to get her 2 hot dogs and 1 hamburger and it wasn\u2019t even busy.",
          "Rides like The Calico Mine Train and Timber Mountain log ride make Knott's Berry farm one of the best theme parks in the entire world! Camp Snoopy is great for kids! The Calico Mine Train is great for everyone and a must do. Timer Mountain log ride is a classic! Voyage to the",
          "This trip was AMAZING!! The park/staff did a complete 180 from our last visit to now. We had such a wonderful time at the park we went back for a second day. Everyone was engaged and made our stay awesome!! The rides were great! Last month we went and it was horrible. The staff",
          "We bought our tickets online in Australia for Knotts Berry Farm in Anaheim which was a lot cheaper and also added the carpark and one all day all you can drink Souvenir cup which you could refill every 15 minutes. $149 Australian for 3 Adults. We went on Thursday 31st October",
          "We visited from the UK to go to Disneyland but noticing this park was close by with good ticket prices we decided to buy a day ticket. The park was fantastic we had a great day and regretted not having time to come back for a second day as the park had so much to do with many",
          "Always entertaining. The lines were too long for the kids to wait, but there is so much entertainment going on all over the park that they didn\u2019t miss going on the rides. It was very cold.",
          "This is a very fun and unique theme park. It was extremely crowded when we went which was a little frustrating but it\u2019s to be expected with Christmas break. My main complaint would be with the wristbands for food. We\u2019re from Florida so we\u2019ve been to Sea World and other amusement",
          "Like any other attractions long lines and busy. 45$ to get into the park and once your inside there\u2019s nothing but crafts tables to buy over priced treasures. You should skip this place and go to Disney. I\u2019ve been going to Knots Berry since a child and finally brought my kids but",
          "Our young adult and teenage kids have outgrown Disneyland so we tried Knotts Berry Farm today. Everyone had a great time and the roller-coasters are amazing!!! The fast lane pass is an absolute must and we walked right onto the rides where everyone else was waiting for 2 hours",
          "For those who have younger kids, 36 inches or taller, Knott\u2019s is great and cheaper than Disneyland. We purchased online tickets and using AAA membership promo code \u201cAAA\u201d for Xmas eve tickets, and it came to be $47 per person. The food is not great but expensive. I would suggest",
          "We went on Saturday so it was crowded but a great place to take the kids, loads of food and fun with some long lines in snoopy town - the vendors and decor in calico village were fantastic ! We ate at the fried chicken restaurant outside the park and while the service was great",
          "I have not been inside the park for 4 years. Went for the Christmas stuff and it was very nice. Not overcrowded like Disneyland. My 28 year old wanted to do Hang Time a new Roller Coaster and he loved it so I will have to go back for him. For Christmas a lot of people selling",
          "Our family was thinking about Disneyland for an end of summer trip, but then we remembered an old favorite Knottsberry Farm. We decided to change things up and gave Knotts a try. As much of a Disney fan as I am, I am glad we passed on Disney this year. For one, the ticket",
          "Went to Knotts Merry Farm to get in the holiday mood, had so much fun on Saturday..went back for more on Sunday..The place is decked out in holiday decor, with the best being the huge Christmas tree..hang around til it's dark ..what a treat to see the tree all lit up, felt like",

          "We signed up for an annual pass, and really enjoyed our first visit on it. Great rides and mid week the lines were almost non existent.",
          "We had a great time at Knotts berry Farm. The rides were majorly great. The food was good. My favorite part was the overall aesthetics of the park. Had great themes and different styles throughout the park that stayed true to California",
          "5 of the major rides were down, the entire time (they didn't have posted anyplace at the ticket booths that these rides were down so we could decide if we wanted to pay the $85.00 per ticket) which made the lines even longer, every ride had a 60-90 min wait. Our family was only",
          "I went to Knott's Berry Farm to ride roller coasters and it certainly filled the bill there, but I found myself also enjoying the old west (ghost town) historic area and the shows. I enjoyed the train around the park and the mine train ride (which is not the usual mine train",

          "So many rides, so little time to do them in. Its much better if you come here midweek when queues are much much shorter. There is no age limit to this place. Ive seen 8 year olds get out screamed by 68 year olds. So much fun for everyone. A great day out for you... and your",
          "Took two girls there to celebrate their birthdays. Both had a great time. The park has a lot of diversity in attractions. But I found the Park was poorly lit at night. Also one member of our group was handicapped and went to customer services and got a blue pass for having less",
          "We were staying on Beach/Ball so Knotts was very close to us. We visited on Halloween and it was fantastic. We went in the daytime as the scary farm would've been to scary for our daughter. It was amazing! Our first visit to a theme park lived up to and surpassed expectations.",
          "THIS IS THE KING OF HALLOWEEN AGAIN. Welcome back to the top of the mountain. Great talent, great decor and great new mazes!",

          "My family has the best day at Knott\u2019s Berry! My boys wanted to ride coasters and boy did they ride! Hardly any wasted time waiting in lines for anything, many different styles of coasters and so many other attractions to keep you entertained all day long. I really loved to old",
          "Loved this place out of Knott's Berry, Disney or Californian Park. Knotts Berry was family focused and had great activities and rides. The best out of the three. Definitely worth the visit. Has the biggest wooden roller coaster in the world. Incredible. Because of the time",
          "I told my nephew he could choose between Universal Studios, CA Adventure Park or Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. He researched all of the parks and chose Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. I was thrilled because it was less expensive and the park seemed to be manageable to get around in one day. They had",
          "I remember going to Knott's berry farm many times as a kid when it was free to get and you paid for rides you wanted to go on. It was a very cool place to visit back then. Now there are several roller coasters and many other rides. Knott's is half the price of Disney and not as",
          "Visited Knotts Berry Halloween Horror on a Saturday night. That was my first mistake. The Park was full of screaming teenage girls. Honestly, it spoilt the whole experience. They seem to oversell these events in America, probably greed, but it does distract from the whole",
          "What a cute theme park. We were there during a boisenberry festival. Not something you get in Florida often. Two teenage girls found lots to do and see. Loved this cute theme park.",
          "Knott\u2019s Berry Farm is a real gem!! It\u2019s full of great rides, shows and entertainment. It\u2019s a good value for the cost of a ticket",
          "Visited on a Wednesday late August , no queues at all , walked on to all rides straight away , kids loved it. The only reason i can\u2019t mark as 5 stars is that it cost $20 to park the car when we visited during the day and a further $25 to park again at night when we returned for",
          "We spent a week in the Los Angeles area the last week of September. We visited Universal's HHN, The Queen Mary's Dark Harbor, Mickey's Halloween Party and Knott's Scary Farm. We were so impressed with the mazes and scare zones at Scary Farm. We loved Special Ops Infected!! So",
          "If you go early enough when this place opens you can get all the rides done. You also get a nice discount on an entry ticket if you are a AAA member. The roller coasters are amazing including the new Wave Rider!",

          "Talking my teenage twins into skipping Disneyland in favor of Knott's Berry Farm wasn't easy but, they loved it. Short lines and unique attractions make this a wonderful day at the park with food, fun and memories. Loved, loved, loved the train ride and log ride. The stagecoach",
          "This is the first park to open. They also were the first to have Knott's Scary Farms. You can not miss Scary Farms if you into Halloween!!!! During the day the park is not very busy on these days; but you have to purchase a new ticket for the evening Halloween. Another one",
          "Get a fright lane pass or dont go unless you want to wait for each attraction for 90 minutes or more. Trust me on this one. Its pricey and you have to buy in advance. If you want to ride Ghost Rider take advantage and go on a couple times in a row when the park opens. Later in",
          "Fun place to take kids and some fun adult rides as well. A lot cheaper then Disneyland as well but not as nice either. Kids love seeing Snoopy and riding all the kid rides. They have some neat shows as well.",
          "We went for the \"Scary\" Farm after dark. There are \"scare zones\" which are certain sections of open space where you are walking where monsters will scare you, jump out at you, scream at you, run in front of you and/or stalk you. Definitely not for the faint of heart!",
          "We went on a Wednesday. We saved money by getting tickets online. Wait for rides was less then 10 minutes. We ordered lunch tickets online as well and ate at Panda Express. That line was a little long but if your hungry like everyone is you just wait on a line. The only ride",
          "Let me start by saying \"WOW\" for years I heard Knotts was incredibly great. I finally took a trip to experience the Knotts Scary Farm event. It was by far the highlight of my entire Halloween adventure in California. I felt I had gone back in time to an old western town.",
          "Knotts Berry Farm is just packed with real roller coasters. Not the poor 3D and 4D (what is that?) false roller coasters you experience at Universal Studios, but real, sometimes quite terrifying roller coasters. There's no queues if you're out of season and (I'm told) not very",
          "We went right after it stopped raining. Crowds were very light. We have a great time. Super fun rollercoasters. Nicely done up for Halloween.",
          "Family of 4, two kids 8 and 10 had a great day. Really fun rides and a good way to avoid the ridiculous prices at DW and US. Lines were okay this Monday. Only reason I'm not giving a 6 is the line app which wasn't working at all.",
          "Took my family to Knott\u2019s on a Tuesday and there was hardly anyone there. Longest wait in line was maybe one or two rounds of the ride or even staying on and going again. Cost is much cheaper than Disney, which is good if you are more focused on the rides than the name of the",
          "I was in the OC for a couple days & had 2 options for theme parks. Disneyland or Knott\u2019s. I choose Knott\u2019s figuring it\u2019d be maybe less busy & they have more \u201cAdult\u201d rides. Am I so happy i choose Knott\u2019s. I had ZERO clue they had that many Extreme Thrill Rides like the Silver",
          "My boys ages 8,10,12 thought that Knotts Berry was the best we visited 7 parks on our 2 week vacation to the states and they loved it.They are very much thrill seekers and the level 5 rides there absolutely did it for them,I loved how they rated the rides 1-5 wa speed ect so you",
          "Thank you Knott\u2019s for helping provide our family with an incredible day. On a personal note, we had a child with Autism who required special assistance. Knott\u2019s is the perfect place to visit if you\u2019re in a similar situation because they generously accommodated our requirements",

          "So I've been going to Knott's Scary Farm for many years and this year was an improvement over the last few years. There's fewer mazes but this they have were overall pretty good, with The Depths and Dark Entities (two new ones for 2018) being among my favorites. Trick or Treat",
          "Just a great park. Staying at the hotel is worth the price. All the Peanut's characters were dressed in Themed Costumes. I posted on of Schroeder as Phantom of the Opera.",
          "Went on last Sunday in September and it was only open 9 to 5 which was a shame but we managed to ride everything anyway!! Lines were not long at all though not everything open at first. River rapids ride had me absolutely saturated, be warned! Teenagers loved hangtime and",
          "We are normally Disneyland people, but decided on a smaller vacation this year. The best thing about Knotts is there is no crowd. There were people, but never any line/wait over 10-15 minutes, most in the 5-10 minute range, some under. No hoards of people to work your way",
          "We visited this park a few times during our 2 week holiday, this park is easily the best theme park in LA, the ghost town is so amazing and ghost rider is the best ride!!! There\u2019s such a family feel about this park, I feel like a lot of effort and thought has gone into it and",
          "We added a few days to our vacation plans specifically to include Knott's Scary Farm. This is the absolute best haunted house experience ever (well haunted maze). I live not far from Universal Studios in Orlando, and this blows away Halloween Horror Nights, by leaps and bounds.",
          "Worst experience ever. 1. Lines lines lines. Too many people let in at once. Greed. 2. Paid for tickets and parking online then charged another 15 dollars at the booth 3. Poorly marked. Hard to navigate as a result 4. Ran out of maps. What? Either printed too few or more",
          "Went on a Friday in October - no crowds and got on all the rides very easily (after walking thru some of the lines, I can't imagine going on a busy day). Pros: Ghostrider, Hangtime, La Revolucion. It's not Disneyland or even Magic Mountain in terms of number and quality of",
          "Lot of coasters and a lot of rides. Nephews had a great time. Nephews parents kept track of them and the Uncle/Aunt followed around laughing. Eat before ... Food is super expensive and not worth the money. Overall would return",
          "We visited Knott's Berry Farm on a Saturday in Mid September. 3 adults, and 1 late teen. The last time we were at Knott's was midweek, early December and the crowds were excessively light. This time, we arrived right when the park opened at 10 and stayed until 7. The crowds",
          "My boyfriend and I bought tickets two hours in advance, without really knowing what we were going to, but it was absolutely amazing! It happened to be a \u201cKnott\u2019s scary farm\u201d night for Halloween. The mazes were beautiful & scary, and were also of great variety. The thrill rides",
          "So much better than universal. Great rides for adults and children. Multiple rides for adults. Great themed areas and liked the halloween themes. Only complaint is food is expensive and it's junk food. Need proper sit down options that's not fries and burgers.",
          "Decided to give Knott's a go despite seeing plenty of poor reviews. Pleasantly surprised and for $46 a person, incredible value compared to other parks. We visited on a Monday in September. All rides were open. Lines were basically zero. There was a 10-15 wait once on Hang",
          "Knott's Berry Farm has rides you wouldn't find anywhere else! The wooden roller coaster is amazing! The park in general offers entertainment for all ages and preferences!",
          "This amusement park is as good as it gets. There are rides, food, entertainment, rest areas, souvenir shops and shows for everyone. The class A service is delivered via happy helpful employees. And the cost of tickets and food are dramatically less than nearby parks such as",

          "Stayed in Knott's Berry Farm Hotel previous night (after a long slog at Disneyland Park) walked 10 mins to park entrance, opened 10.00am on the dot. Walked around with ample ease, no queuing for rides, great selection of rides for all ages. Park is set out beautifully,",
          "I visited mid-week in September and the park was not busy. It was amazing, I did all the rides, some multiple times, with no queues. KBF is a great park. It's not too big, so you don't tire as much walking around the park, the attractions are quite close to each other. There are",
          "American schools holiday had ended when we visited so it was nice and quiet. No long queues and plenty of room to walk around and enjoy the Wild West theme. Particularly enjoyed Sad Eye Joe who only 'borrowed' the horse he was accused of stealing, he was really funny. Liked the",

          "Many themes, good rides, nice shows, less queues, cheaper if you use go-card, reasonably priced Indian restaurants nearby. If using the go-card, do go to the Knott's Soak City. It's much more fun, particularly in the lazy river.",
          "We visited Knots over the 4th of July break and it was ok. Between the extremely long lines, hot weather and not great parent swap ride options we actually left earlier than expected. The food stands are basically the same throughout the park offering standard fair food without",
          "This seems to be a forgotten park in the world of Lalaland, the forgotten swan behind Universal Studios, Disneyland, and Six Flags. But it shouldn't be. The park is well laid out (although a few more signs would make it easier to find some entrances), a lot of trees and",
          "We traveled there with the family this summer. We wanted to try something new and boy were we impressed. This place has rides for the kids which were on the same level as many other parks. There are also a lot of roller coasters for the big kids too! the food was great an there",

          "Having been to California adventure, Legoland and universal studios we were half expecting this to be a yawn fest. I am happy to say that my family fully enjoyed our visit. We managed to go on dollar days which was an added bonus. There are far more rides here than all the",
          "Visited with family. Was a fun day with lots of attractions and things to do. I\u2019d give this a 5 rating, except it was a little too expensive for my liking. Otherwise we had a day of fun and the kids were overly excited about the surprise trip. We hit the rides, played games,",
          "Obviously I don\u2019t remember much of my previous visit, however took my family on a trip while visiting other theme parks. We purchased the soak city/Knott\u2019s combo with a fast pass. Fast pass probably wasn\u2019t needed as it wasn\u2019t terribly busy but it was great to be able to not",
          "We thought we'd go take a visit to Knott's Berry Farm last Saturday September 8, 2018. It was my wife's birthday and wanted to go celebrate it at Knott's. Now we both had Season passes plus parking passes which cost's $65 this year, however, when we got there we drove through to",
          "Great experience all round. Clear theme, good rides for all age groups, excellent staff. Highly recommend.",
          "This park is perfect for families with kids 12 and under. We always go the last week of August before school starts. Park closes at 6:00 pm and not much wait time for rides. Kids have a blast. Stay at the hotel and book in advance for special deals.",
          "This is a fun place but I do miss when they had more attractions that were not so intense. It feels like they have lost a bit of their magic just to add shock value. That stuff is not for everyone though.",
          "We live locally and have passes so we come here often. Way way less then Disneyland passes..like 10% of the price. My kids are teens now, so sometimes I just drop them off. I bought them the food pass, so I dont' have to worry about giving them extra money for food. We usually",
          "We did a dual admission price with Soak City. It was crowded, as is to be expected in the middle of summer, so didn\u2019t get to ride a whole lot of rides, but it was a blast and worth it in my opinion. I\u2019d prefer this park to Disney any day.",
          "We visited here on a trip to California whilst experiencing theme parks and rollercoasters. This is an inexpensive park which is deafly worth visiting with many thrills for the price. You will find that this park will only take one day to visit however you may want to visit",

          "This park is not Disneyland, it caters to thrill seekers but still has plenty for the whole family. Of the Cedar Fair parks I've visited, it is one of my favorites. In addition to the latest rides, Knott's has retained its character with the extensive ghost town and live shows.",
          "A great time can be had at Knott's Berry farm. We enjoyed the Ghost town, the real stagecoach ride, the Peanuts characters, camp snoopy, the boardwalk and so much more. There are plenty of rides for 42\" and under to ride with a parent. The shows were a little cheesy, but fun. We",
          "We had a fabulous time at Knott's...all of the employees we dealt with were so courteous and nice, it was a joy to experience Knott's again after so many years!",

          "We all had a wonderful time at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm! There are rides for all type of family members. My youngest son of 8 years old enjoyed the kiddie rides & attractions and my teen & young adult children got to ride the more attention thrilled rides. I love that the Knott\u2019s",
          "I personally like this better than Disneyland. Still some old fashioned parts and great for young kids. They do have roller coasters for the teens. Food is good. We eat at the Chicken dinner restaurant. Always good.",

          "Being a platinum season pass holder with Cedar Fair I have always wanted to make the trip to either he LA or San Francisco area parks. We had the opportunity to stay a few days at the park hotel and visit this last week. It was great and I must say much nicer atmosphere than",
          "All in all if your coming to So Cal..maje sure to go to Knotts...You absolutley hands down get the best bang for your buck...way less than Disney and the rides and atmospheres are 100 times better",

          "I've been twice, once as a teenager and again as an adult. I had a blast both times and can't wait to go back. It's definitely not as crowded as some of the other California theme parks, which makes it more enjoyable not having to wait in lines as long and getting more ride",

          "So that's what my daughter thought! Lmbo. Boy was she surprised! We had a great time in the park.. This was her first experience on roller coasters because of her age. Its the perfect springboard to coaster life. Just enough to get the juice flowing without scaring her for",

          "The lines were short times were fast had no problems getting in and off of rides. The weather was perfect,  not too hot, calm winds. Our grandchildren and us had wonderful time",
          "Amazing experience, very fun for the whole family. But it gets pricey. Having a large family or gets hard to do things like this. But it was doable. Thankful they do offer annual everything pretty much. Other then game passes.",
          "It's the most family oriented park in the U.S. It's not overpriced and the rides are just the right size that parents and their kids can ride together but still get a major thrill. I have loved Knott's all my life and now I get to share the experience with my son.",
          "Such a fun park. Peanuts characters and no lines. We walked on to all rides and thought this was a great alternative when we were tired of the Disney crowds. Fun Americana themes as well and huge fast roller coasters.",
          "We came here for Knott's Scary Farm, and decided to come back for Knott's Merry Farm; as they had Military Discount Days for member and their spouse FREE, and discounted tickets up to six members.  We enjoyed the show!  The food is great, \u2026",
          "Always wanted to come here since 1980.  Living the dream now.  Beautiful amazing fun place.  Staff is just amazing.   Brought my wife and her family up.  Everyone loving it.",
          "Got the pass $99, food pass for $115 and parking for $75. Covers the whole year, no blackout days. Great deal for those of us that can't afford the most expensive place on earth. I strongly recommend Knott's.  But please not on the days I go , shorter lines you know. Ha, ha, ha.",
          "Great pricing and all the holes were so fun to play! Went there on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy. We were able to play with not a lot of waiting \ud83d\ude01",
          "I had a really good time here. I went with some friends, went on some rides, ate some food. Good stuff. Highly recommend. I'll admit it was my bad, but I don't like their refund policy, or lack therefore of. I bought a ticket for the wrong \u2026",
          "Very unorganized and a lot of time being wasted between the ride . Some rollercoasters would take an average of 6:20 from unloading and loading passengers.  What really bothered me was one particular coaster. My kid was tall enough to ride \u2026",
          "It's an amazing experience for the whole family! Everyone will love it there, although I do have to say that the wait time for food there, is very much too long to stand in line for, I feel there's need to be more and faster service for the \u2026",
          "Loved it! We had a blast! Perfect weather and no crowds. My kids were able to ride many of the rides several times! Knotts Berry has very similar rides as Cedar Point but not as many. However, we had a much better time here because it was not crowded. Awesome time! We will definitely be back!",
          "I really enjoy coming here. The passes are super affordable, and there are plenty of options for every thrill level. They also have SUPER BOMB boysenberry foods and an awesome chicken restaurant.  You dont even have to go into the park to enjoy the food. Way cheaper than disneyland, and just as much fun.",
          "Cheap and easy to pay annual pass.  Fun for the whole family.  I don't get tired of going to knott's all year long.  Best cost benefit among California parks.  Knott's Still has free fast pass.",
          "Great place to visit. Was here as a chaperone on a school field trip and it was terrific. Kids loved it, chaperones loved it, EVERYONE loved it basically. The souvenir shop had awesome deals and the food was reasonably priced. Obviously \u2026",
          "I have been coming to Knott's Berry Farm since I was a little girl. It's one of our families most favorite places to go to go. You absolutely have to go on the newest roller coaster called Hang Ten it is an absolute blast. The whole experience is a must while here in Southern California.",
          "You will have a blast at Knotts. The rides are amazing. And the food as well. When you plan to go there. Make sure you get on rides on a empty stomach. Or else you could throw up. But another cases.... You will have the best time of your life.",
          "Knott's Berry has AMAZING roller coasters. Wooden, modern, high speed, drops, etc. It's hard to pick a favorite - there are so many. Kid friendly, great for Snoopy/Peanuts fans. Definitely an amusement park to check out! \nThe funnel cake is also delicious and a great sugar rush when you need some quick energy.",
          "Wait times were not worth the short riding times.  The park layout was confusing, none of the maps labeled the rides or how to access them, let alone a basic \"You are here\" sticker.  When we weren't taking up time in line we were taking up \u2026",
          "An absolutely awesome theme park. We loved everything about it. Well, everything but the fact that basically every ride was out of order repeatedly for half an hour or so. So we spent quite a lot of time with waiting unnecessarily. But other than that the experience was great.",
          "Love this place! Always had fun as a kid and now as an adult. Definitely a cheaper alternative to Disney or Universal Studios.",
          "Knotts was perfect for a Tuesday night. Just a little chilly but awesome! Watched the tree lighting in Calico. The best part though was the wait times... longest we waited was 15 min that's unheard of were got to do everything!  Amazing... Always beautiful around Christmas!",
          "Such a fun family theme park! Can't wait to go again!",
          "Love it here! Kids don't ever want to leave. Many options for food and drinks. You can easily spend all day and not have enough :)",
          "Veteran discounts and free entry on veterans day. Couldn't get more American than that. My family had an epic time. We will always remember. Thank you",

          "This small park boasts numerous rides for all ages. For a fraction of the price of Disney - and a fraction of the waiting time for rides - you can have a very memorable day. Camp Snoopy kept my younger kids entertained for hours, while the \u2026",
          "Easy to get in to parking area, but took awhile. Also took a while to purchase tickets... expect lines especially in Camp Snoopy area during the holidays & LE days..still a great time if you get there early during those times",
          "Had a great time, we went on a Tuesday morning and we didn't have to wait in any lines and we were able to stay on a few rides until lines started to form for a couple of turns. Staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "Lines aren't that bad. There's the kid section. Peanuts theme(Snoopy, Woodstock, Charlie Brown etc), big kids section scary rides. Western theme through out. Lots of different coasters. Carnival type rides and games. Parking was $20.",
          "Soooo much fun!!! It's a mix of Disneyland and Six flags. It has games that are fun for adults and kids. Don't need to have kids to enjoy it.",
          "I had a great time going here recently I just have a problem with how the park is laid out. I felt like was in constant danger just walking around. The rides seem oddly close to those who are just walking around the park. Also the ghost \u2026",
          "We brought our daughter here to celebrate her 5th birthday and had an awesome time! Great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. We look forward to coming back when she is older and can do some of the bigger rides.",
          "Knott's is always a blast and great value for the money, but I had never been there during the holidays before. It truly is merry!! We had a wonderful adventure, it was our daughters' first time at a theme park and they had an absolutely awesome time. We ate at Mrs. Knott's too, always the BEST!!",
          "The rollercoasters were the best. I loved supreme scream because when your at top, you can everything. I mostly liked sol spin, la revolution, and silver bullet. I loved this play and hopefully I come here again.",
          "Great place to get away from the crowds.\n\nI've visited Knott's on multiple occasions and have not been disappointed. Admission is much cheaper compared to others, including season passes. Knott's is regularly adding new attractions which \u2026",
          "Really, Knott's Berry Farm is the funnest...... it has the widest range of age appropriate rides... best roller coasters best kiddie rides a water park for everyone best food best parking and great inexpensive hotels and great restaurants in the neighborhood as well as other things to do within walking distance... Go often have fun.",
          "Freaking love this place. Rides are amazing, food is great with the meal plan. Pass is a solid deal. Have fun every trip.",
          "We spent most of our time at Camp Snoopy. We brought two 3yr olds and a 4 year old and they all had a great time. We adults had fun too. No lines anywhere on a Thursday.",
          "If I lived around the area I would so come here everyday, this is a cute theme park and theres lots to do and see, you might have to visit at least 3 days to get a full experience but other than that its awesome and I suggest trying there boysenberry and eating at there chicken restaurant. It's a wild wild west.",
          "The best then park I've ever been to, and I've been to them all!\n\nGo on the weekdays. We were doing 3x rides on an hour on Thursday, 2x on Friday, and maybe 1/2 of Saturday. The park is maybe 20% of the size of Disneyland, but significantly \u2026",
          "Knott's is unlike other theme parks, but it's hard to put in words how it is unique. Maybe it's the scenery, the way the huge trees make it feel like you're someplace else. The food is tasty. I feel like the food at most theme parks is \u2026",
          "My husband, my son in law, my daughter, and myself enjoyed free entrance today because they are veterans.  Thank you so much!  Our almost 2 year old grandson loved it!  Loved seeing and hugging and kissing Snoopy!  The food and service throughout the park was great.  Ended our day at Mrs. Knotts.",
          "Amazing! Super fun and family orientated. Food is awesome. Rides are exciting! And the shops are super great! Definitely good for almost all ages!",
          "It's been at least 5 years since I went to Knott's Scary Farm and there have been major changes that I can tell. They've definitely stepped up their game and color me impressed!\n\nFirst of all, never go on a weekend or holiday. That's a \u2026",
          "Lions Club dinner & guests. Buena Park Hotel. Food & services were exceptional. \nBuffet was very good. Salad, pasta, vegetables, chocolate Cake for dessert.  Their coffee is fantastic!! Even decalf is good",
          "Something for everyone.  We were a group of 8 ranging from ages 2-34yrs old and we all had a blast.  The \"big kids\"enjoyed the major rides and the \"littles\" enjoyed camp Snoopy.  They even offer nursing rooms for moms and I was thrilled! Way to go Knott's :) genuine FAMILY friendly fun.",
          "If the garlic fries weren't enough reason for five stars, Knott's Merry Farm definitely put it over the top. From a wonderful abridged A Christmas Carol at the Birdcage Theatre to the new and indescribably enjoyable Home for the Holidays \u2026",
          "My family and I went on 2/17/20, which in hindsight was a bit of bad choice, because it is a holiday. It was Presidents day. Well it was busy, very busy in fact. So the lines had very long wait times. And their App was has a cool feature, \u2026",
          "im so sad  ;(  I love the rides  and their funnel cakes and I wish knotts will be open sooner because me and my friend we have been wanted to go  but I kinda missed a lot activities from knotts berry Fram and even.  brought  my season pass to go but I hope knotts berry Fram will be open soon as possible  I really miss going there",

          "Rides are great.\nFood is awful. Need more choices for healthy eating. The restaurant in Ghost town across from the old fashioned photos...food was fine, but the tables are so old, the tops are sticky...and they are wiped down! Just yucky. \u2026",
          "I have always enjoyed Knott's Berry Farm's rides, food, and various California themed park areas. My boyfriend and I are season pass holders because it is so affordable and worth it! I'm very pleased with Knott's Berry Farm's decision \u2026",
          "Amazing historical and educational activities. The Native American dancers and the train were our favorite. There are lots of rides that are family friendly too.",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is such a great place. We recently went back to Knott's Scary Farm and were very impressed by the amount of detail and depth that went into the entire park. We also love going to Knott's Merry Farm, again a great level of \u2026",
          "Delivering on the fun since the 1940s and still going strong. Moderately priced as compared to other major theme parks. Historical and modern rides. Camp snoopy for the kids. Lots of shops and food choices. If you live in the SoCal area the \u2026",
          "Pretty good. They require ID if you use your card to park. Very annoying when some families SHARE an account under one name. However, this was not the case for me. Crowds were medium, and I got to ride the attraction the replaced boomerang. Food was pretty good and the gold mining ride still gives me nostalgia",
          "Always a really fun family park! There's so much to do here with little kids and for adults. There's so much that goes on here. I love all the events and themes they have for every season and holiday. Inexpensive and well worth spending the day here!",
          "I love knots, this will be the 4th year in a row getting year passes and it's always been worth it. whether you're going to eat or going to ride rides there's always something to do and have fun with.",
          "This was a wonderful place full of Peanuts characters, rides, thrills, shops, and even some culture. The lines weren't too long, the park was clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Also the souvenirs were fairly priced such that a \u2026",
          "Great park but can get crowded during peak times. The season pass is the best way to go...a much better bargain than Disney. Head there after 8 for a less crowded experience.",
          "Getting through the first two gates was extreme crowded and took forever even though we prepaid for tickets. The first hour or more was all booths selling products. Once past that it was cute decor and eventually found a few rides that the \u2026",
          "Had a great time. Weekday is amazing as you are able to just get on rides. Food and drinks are expensive as expected at an amusement park. One thing I don't agree with is that there were some things that weren't open because of was a week \u2026",
          "If you go during the week the lines are very short and you will enjoy every ride. Also i enjoyed the dill pickle corn dog.",
          "This was part of our last family trip to California. It was an incredible day! Beautiful park, fun rides, not crowded, perfect!",
          "Its was super fun! So many cool rides and delicious treats. The only thing that I would change is there should be most places to get popcorn. I found popcorn eventually but it took awhile and there was only one place",
          "Great place! wish they had water bottle refill stations, coming from AZ we drink lots of water and refill throughout the day. I like the baby station in camp snoopy it was very helpful when changing our infant. We love visiting Knotts!",
          "It was my 1st time going to Knott's Berry farm and I truly enjoyed it. They had a Winter festival going on. I was there when they opened and closed. Some lines for the rides were ridiculous but it was totally worth it. Better than Disneyland lines.",
          "It was nice to go during the week with my toddler so he could run around freely. We were disappointed that a lot of the stuff was close. I was told they only open everything on the weekend not cool. If that's the case why not have a \u2026",
          "Knott's is a great alternative to the other theme parks in the area. I may be easily over looked compared to Disney but don't. This is a very fun place. We spent the second half of the day after a noon flight. It was way better priced than \u2026",
          "Even though it was crowded today, we still had fun.  Food was pretty good for an amusement park.  Definitely looking forward to using our annual pass this year!",

          "We absolutely love coming here as a family! So much less crowded than Disneyland and way more affordable! Ever since Cedar Fairs bought them they completely given the place a facelift! The Christmas decorations are so beautiful with snow and everything!!",

          "Best theme park ever!\ni really like knotts berry farm, we have season passes and like to come as often as we can. i like how how all the food is cheap (and good) and how there is something for everyone. all the little kids can go to camp \u2026",
          "I consider that paying $22 for parking is too much. It could be better to park somewhere around a mile and take an Uber. Entering the park was fast, considering that you have to go through the Security Screening. They give you a map when \u2026",
          "So for Halloween we decided to give Knott\u2019s Scary Farm a try. We had never  been to Knott\u2019s at all. Let me tell you, it was the BEST DECISION! As former scare actors we don\u2019t scare easily so we\u2019re more in it to look at the sets/decorations \u2026",
          "We were very grateful to be able to enjoy Knott's Berry Farm as courtesy guests during Fire and Law Tribute days.\n\nI had not been to Knott's in about 25 years. The park has a much more intimate vibe than Disneyland. There is more of a \u2026",

          "Love this park. Not too big not too small. My older kids can have fun and go with their friends while I ride the smaller rides with my youngest. Hes still not brave or tall enough for the big kid rides yet.",
          "Oh my gosh we went on a perfect day. Weather was lovely and lines were short!! Nothing better than that! We all enjoyed ourselves so much!! Take a day off work like I did and go before the kids are let out of school and you will love it at Knotts!!\ud83d\ude01",
          "Food was good & they gave you alot more than you could eat! Everyone who worked here were helpful & answered all your questions. We had a great time!! We are pass holders & we're going to come often! It was a beautiful warm day & it wasn't too crowded , they also hire great ppl to work here!",
          "Went here 5 days ago after not going for like 17 years. It was amazing how they've transformed this park. Especially with how little room they have to work with. But some how it seems so much bigger. It's worth every cent to visit. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcb0",
          "Great place! Heavy duty extreme rides. Not too busy so lines were great. Only thing that was annoying is they were running half the roller coasters and sending half through empty. They said it was because it was not crowded but there were \u2026",

          "I haven't been to Knott's Berry Farm for many years.  We got a good price for our tickets through AAA.  Overall a great park and great value.  I would have liked less graffiti scratched into the bathroom walls. They have a lot of kid rides \u2026",

          "Went for the first time in Christmas 2019. You will not be disappointed. It\u2019s a must visit place!",
          "Good Fun,  decent amount of thrill rides. Ghost rider was a pleasant surprise considering the age of the coaster. They should have the single rider lane for all the coasters,  so much more efficient. Really Annoying that one of the places \u2026",
          "I feel that Knotts is reasonably priced and is good fun for the family. I am bothered that they think the name Knotts gives Customer Service a right to treat you horribly and can say what they want. It is fun. Just hopefully you don't need help..",
          "The Holiday Skating with Snoopy was so Great!!  The Skater's in the Show were Outstanding!!   Also saw Krazy Kirk and the Hillbillies!! Very Funny!! Have Loved them since they were at Disneyland!!   So Happy to see them at Knott's!!",
          "Best amusement park I have been to. Service is top notch. Rides are excellent for adult thrill seekers as well as small children. Shows are great. Different seasons throughout the year bring new shows and food with each one. Food is amazing. Staff is helpful and friendly. Cant be beat.",
          "Fun family outing and saved some money with a promotion Knott's had. The place was pretty empty so the kids went on all the rides multiple times. Check the website for promos.",
          "It may not be the MOST magical place on Earth, but for the much smaller price tag, much shorter lines, and the absence of major crowds, it's worth it. We have a season pass because the littles are still very little and we're often in and \u2026",
          "My family and I have enjoyed our Knott's passes the last two years and now we are on for year three.  Both of our kids are under three so we only need to worry about us adults.  The kids still have a blast and enjoy all the rides and holiday deco along with treats for kids.",
          "This amusement park doesn't get to overcrowded, so you can enjoy your day. I usually make it a weekend in the summer with my family and stay at the knott's hotel so we can go to the waterpark the first day and the amusement park the next \u2026",
          "Since Disneyland has absorbed all human life on a daily basis, Knott\u2019s is a great place for the family to go to get out of the house. Get an annual pass with a meal plan and one annual refillable cup, and you\u2019re set. You\u2019ll spend 1/10th the \u2026",
          "Awesome experience. When\u2019t during the off season between Halloween and thanksgiving. No wait time and no crowds and perfect weather. Heaps cheaper then the overpriced park down the road. We had the bbq pork ribs for lunch, perfect. Could have ate more but didn\u2019t want to get sick on the endless rides.",
          "Knott\u2019s Berry Farm is so much fun! I went for my birthday and had the best time. My boyfriend and I ate at the italian buffet and it was so good! The whole park is set up so cute and I enjoy going so much!",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is always worth it. While the food is expensive they give you a hefty portion and it's always good. I recommend going all out with the boysenberry stuff, it's all good. Especially the boysenberry icecream, it's my \u2026",
          "Look, Knott's Berry Farm is enjoyable and has some crazy fun roller coasters! Plus Knotts Scary Farm is tons of fun! (Buy your tickets online before you go!) But the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it's really not \u2026",
          "Great amusement park that has many good attractions and it the prices are much more fair than other amusement parks while still retaining the entertainment value. The passes are much more worth the price than others. Overall probably the most convenient and open amusement park that has everything a park can offer.",
          "Restaurants weren't open when park opened. There wasn't any sign in the windows Saying when they would open. I asked other employees when the restaurants would open and all they could say was they think they opened at 11 a.m. They work \u2026",
          "I had a blast! Went there as a chaparone for my school and had fun every second that I was there. From all the rides there to the amazing shows that happen throughout the day. I couldn't think of a better field trip and I'm sure the rest of the school would agree on that.",
          "I love Knott's berry farm!! The rides are great and the park seems bigger once you are inside. There is something for everyone from thrill rides and kids rides.",
          "Always a good time and the people who work here are nice!! Expect to spend about 4 or 5 dollars for a drink. You must try the funnel cakes they were big enough that the 3 of us couldn't even finish it.",
          "I always visit on weekdays and there's no lines! Small enough to ride every ride in a few hours and big enough to have a wide variety for kids to adults. However the free 3 hour parking with a receipt used to be the best way around paying \u2026",

          "Great time not over crowded.  Was able to get on most rides with out a long wait. Military were honored by free entry. Way to go Knott's Berry  for recognizing those that served.  Please continue this",

          "Cool spot. Very affordable. Some decent rides. Great place for the family. Not many adult rides but plenty of games and places to eat such as panda express and johnny rockets",
          "Always go here with my friends. Bought a season pass and it was so worth it. If you\u2019re looking into buying one, you definitely should. Park is really clean and the rides are fun. \ud83d\ude03",
          "We have been coming to this popular theme park for decades and it never gets old. They keep reinventing themselves and coming up with creative attractions and rides. The walk from the parking lot will add some steps to your Fitbit but it's \u2026",
          "Build a Bear! \u2764 Right before you enter Knotts! \nKnotts is so much fun! If you go during the week you'll be able to get in every ride at least twice!",

          "Fun for all ages 0 to 100... From kiddie coasters to the scariest of coasters... You will find something for everyone to do! Very fun atmosphere! And tons of different themes!",
          "Great place for the family. Reasonable prices. It's probably my favorite theme park",
          "I'll always love knott's and the vintage feelings that come with it. The only complaint I could ever make is improve the parking situation. All parking lots are reasonably close by. But you never know where you're going to park. All they \u2026",
          "On Super Bowl Sunday Knotts was basically all to ourselves. No more than 5 minutes wait time on only one ride all the other we just walked in to the seat. It was amazing and fun.. Didn't even get off of Jaguar and got a second ride. Next year I'm taking advantage of this day again.",
          "My family and I used to have season passes at Disneyland until it became ridiculously expensive and their version of family values has changed and does not match our family values any longer, and so we no longer cared to return again.  We \u2026",
          "Lots of vegan options, which is nice. They make it super easy on their site. And the rides are fun if the lines aren't too long.",
          "An amazing theme park with so much charm and a surprising selection of thrill rides. Don\u2019t miss out on  the Calico Mine Ride!",
          "I loved it so much, this place will be probably my next visit when I get the chance to come by again. I really recommend this place for those that want a good price or a good place to have some fun with their family or for those that are on there special romantic night.",
          "We took my 88 yr old Mom. We had a really nice time. When we left we ate at the Chicken House. Absolutely had a blessed day. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
          "New years was awesome here, had no idea how much fun we would have. I would question the fairness in what I felt was an all white vendor situation. That was not cool. purchased the Fast Past but was still made to wait in certain lines, but \u2026",
          "Incredible! I was there in 1973. In the photos, the one with glasses. In the second with my father. He was the one who took me. How many years and I could not return. The other kid is William, a friend from Los Angeles.",
          "Wonderful vendors, loved the Snoopy on Ice show. Informative also. Jake at the Western Trails Museum was so enlightening. He was very kind. And reminded us to choose to be also to make a change in our world. Knotts has by bring joy and appreciating our past.",
          "I love Independence Hall on Veterans Day.  I'm not certain why the moments in there resonate.   Perhaps it's the cry for unity, the demand for a stance against that which holds back the sheer will of Life Liberty and Happiness.  The \u2026",
          "If you like adult adrenaline rides then this is the place !!! Many high speed, mind blowing, guarantee will make your stomach turn up side down. The also got area for kids (Camp Snoopy) so everyone in the family can have fun there. I give 4 stars due to park is not as clean as others and many attractions are closed that day",
          "Great customer service and food and drinks and they are very friendly to you and your family and friends. The Chicken dinner is very delicious and rest for awhile because, you will be stuffed!!!!",
          "We loved going to Knotts Berry farm, my 3 year old had a blast and the adults had a blast. my only negative was google had the opening time as 9 when they actually opened at 10. However, this allowed us to get great parking and get on rides easily instead of dealing with long waits. :)",
          "Love   Went for our ten years anniversary. Played like kids at the park and picked up our favorite jams on the way out.  Heading back there in the spring fun day",
          "Fun and affordable park. Specially if you get the annual pass you Dave a lot of money . They added a lot of new ride and at Christmas The decorations and The ambiance is very nice. The food is a little pricy but it is like this in every park.",
          "My kids prefer this park to Disneyland. Great rides with shorter lines, cheaper, and great vibe: family run feel! We loved the old school wooden roller coaster. The log flume ride is one of the best, and the games are more winnable.",
          "We love knotts. That's why I decided to get season passes so the fun never ends.every week we go and ride all the roller coasters the only downside is the wait times but that's a given",
          "Something to do. All western themed, and fun! Lots of coasters! Coal mine train interesting! Camp Snoopy fun for everyone! Small ice cream over  $7. A beer $11.00... rent a locker $14.  Be prepared!",
          "It is an amazing time, the rides are great, but waiting 50 min. For a 45-60 second ride is not always the best time. Over all It is a great place if you want to get out of the house with friends and family.",
          "A must visit if you like old western themes",
          "Had a great day at Knott's. It has something for everyone. Even just to walk around the park. Get you day passes on line and save close to $30.00. Or just get an annual pass for just a bit over the regular price, if you live in So. Cal. You get discounts throughout the park with it.",
          "It was my my sisters in my 1st time going enter is very fun lots of things to do and go to the roller coasters where amazing.",
          "Such a great and wonderful theme and amusement park for the while family! Holiday seasons are always the best, especially harvest, Halloween, and the winter season. Great shows, great rides for all ages, and not too expensive.",
          "I love this place!! I know it's no Disneyland, but it's unique in it's own way. I love the fact that anyone could enjoy the park. This could be seen by just walking around, attending shows, playing games, shopping, or getting on rides. Not only that, but the workers are kind and caring.",
          "So much to do, very entertaining. Come on the off season. One needs to stay into the evening to see it at night, loved the lights.",
          "Parking was not very helpful sending me around and around with tiny signs that said \"all day parking\". People were confused as were we as were to go.\nWe just got a season pass and enjoyed the heck out of the park after the parking.\nFood \u2026",
          "Going during the week is awesome. Short lines and a good time! You get to see what the park truly has to offer when you aren't in line most of your visit.",
          "Food is really good. A nice variety of shops. Love the coasters",
          "It is a good place to spend time with family. The food is good and the rides too. One small thing, the rides are sometimes closed but it's not a big deal. The price is good too.",
          "We love Knott's! We get passes every year and always have a great time! They are always doing different shows and events. This last Christmas the Snoopy on Ice show was fantastic! Knott's is very easy to walk and has great rides for kids and adults. It's always a blast when we go! Plus their boysenberry pies are incredible! Yum!",
          "Love Knott's. Who doesn't love an adventure Park! Buuuttt they really gotta upgrade their park and maybe add a few more lights so it won't be so dark while you wait in lines.",
          "So fun and accommodating! Kids want to go every week.",
          "Best place to go on vacation we love going ever year. Staff is friendly food is good the all day eating pass is a great deal and even have gluten free options, the prices of the park is reasonable. They support our military and let them into the park for free 1 time a year.",
          "All the rides were a lot of fun except the second time we went on the log ride. 1 hour before closing we went on the log ride and my feet and socks got soaking wet because the workers don't dump out the water during the day. This made me very upset because I had to walk around with my shoes and socks soaking wet.",
          "Super fun. Full of exciting rides and fun entertainment. Great way to let go of your stress and live in the moment.",
          "This is not a park that\u2019s all full of fun because there are so many people who cut line and they don\u2019t do anything about it. Also the park doesn\u2019t have anymore then one park photographer and there is usually a very long line. If there is to many people you might not get a picture. This is not the best fun park !!!!",
          "Came here with my son for Halloween's eve.  It was a perfect evening and night for us. Lot's of scary attractions. Everything is well organized from parking, to toilettes and food.",
          "Brilliant rides. Food is great. Better than Disneyland by miles!",
          "Great time!!! We went in late January weather was perfect. There were absolutely NO LINES!! Had so much fun for a work outing!!",
          "Kids loved it. I loved the horse drawn stage coach.  Great family outing for teenagers to toddlers. Everyone was worn out at the end of the night.  Only thing I didn't like was the parking is too far and the walk to the park from the lot. They need a shuttle.",
          "Great family place. Yes, no Disneyland. But in my opinion it makes it better. More family centered.",
          "Thank you Cedar Fair for buying this park.\nPrices are very reasonable. Season Passes are awesome. Doing a really good job at adding quality attractions. Park and bathrooms are nice and clean and the quality of the food has gotten better. \u2026",
          "$15 refillable drinks are great. Food wasn't bad and reasonably priced for an amusement park.  Parking is $20, kinda high for how far you have to walk.  I love that you can put in a form for lost stuff. Every time we've come a ride or 2 are out of service. Maps kinda confusing. Friendly workers, very helpful.",
          "The rides were fun enough but the lines... Gosh.... Every ride was over 2 hours. I've been to other parks that were just as packed but they did a much better job of moving people through the lines and onto the rides. Also, everyone that \u2026",
          "Knott's merry farm is amazing. Great place to take your family during the Christmas season for some traditional Christmas celebrations throughout the park. Great holiday music playing throughout the park.",
          "I\u2019ve been going to Knott\u2019s since I was a baby in the 90s. I have so many memories here with my siblings,  cousins and friends. I still go a few times a year and it hasn\u2019t changed a bit except a  few older rides gone and a few new rides but \u2026",
          "There's more for young children than Disneyland. It's a very pleasant place to spend the day even if you don't ride the rides.",
          "Good prices on tickets but they sure make their money off of you in other ways. $4.50 for a bottle if water is absurd to me.  Quality if food definitely does not match what they charge for it. I don't mind paying a bit of money for good food. I would suggest bringing snacks and eating before and after outside of Knott's.",
          "I love this place.  For as much of fun if not more than Disney Land, you pay a lot less. It's been my son and my favorite place on earth for years.",
          "Best experience yet so far. Best place to go with family and friends. May get expensive but worth it.",
          "Like the coaster especially the ghost rider. If you want to ride everything just buy the fast lane it's much convenient and bring water cause the water there is overpriced. And that's me holding a strangers hand cause why not. Nice meeting you renee",
          "Wonderful amusement park. It's the very first amusement park created in the area, and they continually bring in new rides and roller coasters to keep it exciting and relevant. \nThey have fun experiences and rides for all ages. The roller \u2026",
          "Great place for family and friends. Some of the best rides for kids AND adults. Definitely coming back...",
          "We bought our gold passes and had so much fun! Snoopy was so cute lol. The lines were fast and we didnt have to wait too long.",
          "Season pass holder. Great value, especially with a dining plan. Kids enjoy Camp Snoopy (7 and 4). Older child likes riding the smaller roller coasters - Sierra Sidewinder, Coast Rider. Thrill rides for all levels. Events throughout the year \u2026",
          "My daughter had a geologist field trip here and she loved it. We were able to play the rest of the day in the park. My favorite ride is the silver bullet. My daughters favorite ride is xcelerator. We will be going back for an engineering field trip in a few months. Everything was great.",
          "Clean, friendly, affordable and incredible coasters for all ages. Camp Snoopy is so perfect for the Littles and lunch at Mrs. Knotts Chicken should be a tradition...menu changes caused a few lunch issues but was rectified by Manager. Also, make reservations via text, otherwise, long wait",
          "You can't go wrong with a season pass ... Lots of things to do for all ages from heavy coasters to kiddie rides and even shows ... Food prices aren't bad and if you have a season pass there is a small discount on most of the merchandise and dinning ... I would have to say the only down are the lines but that's a given for a theme park",
          "I haven't been here in many years and really enjoyed some of the new roller coasters - especially because it was off-season and there were literally no lines.",
          "Lots of fun but very overpriced. Outdated and behind the times.",
          "We had a blast. We went for my granddaughter's 10th birthday and it was so fun. I rode Ghost rider, scary but it was exhilarating. Good expensive food. We want to go back during Christmas time because it is decorated so beautifully",
          "Dining needs serious help. Tables too high, not enough tables, not enough chairs, not enough high chairs, too expensive, for this price they could at least have a place for families to sit down! It took about an hour just to wait in line and then wait for food.",
          "We go all the time, have a year pass with a meal plan on it. We can go just to eat, ride a ride or spend the hole day. It's a great special to buy and very well worth your money.",
          "Our first time there. Everyone was very helpful and courteous. We had a wonderful day there.",
          "Great place full of fun and nostalgia. The coasters are fun and provide great thrills - my personal favorite is the Ghost Rider. I recommend anything boysenberry!",
          "It wasn't overcrowded. You get discounts with a season pass. And we all have a good time.",
          "Charlatans. They promised, in writing,  a refund of tickets I purchased in error if I bought new tickets and went to guest services while at the park. It has been months and they won't honor their word. I am sure it is great if you don't have snafu and don't mind patronizing a dishonest business.",
          "Knotts #1 \nWhen it comes to family value  you will get more bang for your buck here better food \nClassic rides best wood roller coasters in California  more found memories here\nThan the most crowded place on earth \ud83c\udf0f\nIts just a better vibe here  its real..!\nNot fake like across the street",
          "Tuesday February 19th was the perfect day. Perfect weather + not too crowded = a lot of rides without waiting in line all day!",
          "I remember this being much more fun when I was younger! We went to Knotts Scary farm and it seemed like EVERY parent in the area dropped off all their teenage kids. The lines were very long and honestly, within 2 hours, we were ready to go \u2026",
          "A super fun family place to come either with the kids, your partner or even with just friends. I recommend getting the pass. It's worth it for California residents",
          "I went to Knott's on 1.25.2020 I bought a season pass with the drink,  food pass . I went this restaurant in the park ordered our food and wanted.to sit down and eat , but.this place was filthy , food alongside the trash can, food and trash \u2026",

          "My favorite theme park.  My 3 and a half year old loved camp snoopy.  If you go off season, hardley any lines.  I liked the ghost town, i felt like john wayne as i walked around.",

          "Knott\"s Berry Farm has always been a good place to visit when you have the time. If you live nearby, (like I do) you get to personally connect with the park. As a young boy, I loved Camp Snoopy as well as the various family attractions. Now \u2026",
          "First time here and im already in my 50s. Lol. And yes i even live in Orange County CA. Thanks to my Granddaughter's for dragging me here now I can't wait to come back. So much fun and the food is off the hook. Yes its very pricey \u2026",

          "One of the finest theme parks anywhere. Rides run to capacity with friendly staff. The park itself is immaculate and has a great selection of attractions. It's compact too - you won't spend more time walking around than riding. Park food is in a different class to Six Flags etc.  Along with Disneyland it's a must visit.",

Love the atmosphere there put out for halloween also!",

          "Less character experience, but more rides then Disneyland. Love how it's focused on fun rollercoasters. Wild west portion is great place to eat, especially the Fireman BBQ.",

          "Always great. Fantastic fried chicken and boysenberry product selection. Rides for all types.",
          "I think this place is better than Disneyland is way lesser money and way better attractions at least I think so. We like this place so much that my wife and I got season passes.",
          "Worth every dime! Recommended for all ages especially 10 and up",
          "The pass holder Holiday Party was very good.\nA bit crowded,  but good. The 'snow' falling with holiday music playing was very festive - people dancing and singing in the street.\nThanks Knott's.",
          "Much nicer than a Six Flags. Knott's has a unique charm that makes it an easier, cheaper, but lesser experience than Disneyland if serious thrill rides aren't your thing.",
          "Its really a great place to visit.my girls love going to camp Snoopy. Its not as crowded as the other amusement park in the area. And not as expensive. Its the 100th  anniversary of Knott's and they SOAK CITY right nextdoor. So there's 2 parks to choose from during the summer.",
          "Took my kids to Knott's Berry farm. Son is 22, daughter is 16.\nNice weather. Many kids from summer camps. Only line that was over an hour was free-fall. \nSnoopy is awesome. \nAll amusement parks will have waiting lines. After 4 pm, the park \u2026",
          "I love Knotts berry farm. The rides are really a thrill, and they are always adding new rides and changing old ones. The shops and restaurants are pricy but the food is good. There are plenty of days throughout the year where you can go to \u2026",
          "This place even though is small for teenagers is fun. I always come here and enjoy just walking around and eating the delicious funnlecakes that they serve all over the place.",
          "Perfect for ther whole family.  It has entertainment and rides that cater to all ages.  Restrooms are always clean and workers are extremely welcoming and friendly.",
          "Favorite pass holder worthy thrill park. I come here all the time with my hubby. Sometimes we just walk around without getting on rides. I love the vibe here!",
          "Is a great place for all ages. Lines can get crazy but there's am app you can use to plan your day there. The shows age fun and the food is great! My family loves going",
          "Went late in the day and there were no lines! It was great. Only a couple of hours before closing but it worked out well! I will be back with the family.",
          "Have great memories of Knotts with the family. Small enough to kit exhaust you, big enough to spend the whole day.",
          "I have always loved going with my son we have been going since he was a child he is 26 now and we still find time to go.",
          "Peanuts theme and snoopy show was really good, a little loud, kids rides are really good, enjoyed our day, highly recommend the 3 course chicken dinner restaurant",

          "Roller coasters were amazing, too scarry for me but my fearless kids  loved them.",
          "Knott's delivers a consistently fun theme park experience that has kept our family coming back for years. Staff are helpful and friendly, and the over all feeling of the park is warm and inviting.",

          "Exciting rides filled in the whole park! Love it. Night view is beautiful too. #Knott\u2019s Berry Farm",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is no longer the place I grew up with. I can deal with all the new rides and whatnot. But the fact that they now let about four times as many people into the park is absolutely ridiculous. On a busy day you could wait \u2026",
          "Makes me glad to be living in the good old land of the red white and bousenberry.  Loved the short lines and maximum elbow room.",
          "The lines are really long but they try to put shade in a lot of places which really helps. Lots of places to sit and more rides for disabled people. I also like that they hire many disabled people such as the people accepting tickets and \u2026",
          "Had a really great time all the employees are very friendly parking is easy food was good would suggest",
          "Always fast moving lines. They've added some great coasters. Camp snoopy is a blast for little ones and you can get through all rides in one afternoon, unlike other more expensive amusement parks.",
          "First visit of the new year! A little packed, but par for the course when it's a holiday weekend. Got our favorite rides in (still mourning the loss of Iron Reef) and picked up the new unlimited soda bottle to get juice drunk on Berry Punch.",
          "Love this place best prices good place for some family fun or even just a date ! \ud83d\udc95 the food here. And the jams and cool shops u can walk around and see shows and not get on rides if u didnt want to.",
          "It was nice and fun I was a bit scared at first but I went and believe me you will love it",
          "I haven't heard about this place, but it was so worth it. It is as good if not better than Great America and Six Flags. Even if you don't like big rollercoasters, there are plenty of stuff to do.",
          "Great amusement park. Great rides. Not very long wait for rides. Great food and shows.",
          "Knott's Merry Farm is the best!!  We met the crew of 104.3 MYFM,  for a private event that we won tickets to go.  What a fun and AMAZING night!!  We danced with Snoopy and rode the rides!  So much fun!",

          "Nice park with more thrill rides than Disneyland or Universal Hollywood. The park is quite convoluted so you might need to search around a bit for the ride entrances. For a day well worth it.",
          "2nd only to Cedar Point in the Cedar Fair chain. Beautiful, well themed park with lots to do. Had a great time, can't wait to go back!",
          "Like a discount Disneyland.  It was a fun day.  I have a 5 year old who loved the park, my family had fun all day.  Get there early, in the afternoon the place gets crowded with people you don't want to be around.",
          "Knotts Berry Farm is a great place to take your family or friends. The lines are way shorter than Disneyland Universal Studios and Six Flags. Knotts is not like a typical theme park it\u2019s not as crowded as other Theme Parks. The food is \u2026",
          "Love Knott's! Affordable and fun for the whole family. Plenty of bathrooms and water fountains..",
          "I fricken LOVE Knott's Berry Farm. My husband and I go every time we find ourselves near the area. We like to go during the weekday, especially when it'd not during school holidays. We went on a Monday in November this year and the longest \u2026",
          "Great theme park and awesome rides for adults and kids. Reasonable prices on many food options.  Thank you Knott's for the free military days!!!",

          "Great place to bring the family. My son and I loved it! Great rides and great food!",
          "Just another favorite. It really is what I feel is one of the last great theme parks in California. Between the shows that they have throughout the day the wonderful rides the kiddie park there's something for the entire family to do all \u2026",

          "I liked Knotts as a follow-up to Disneyland. Great rollercoasters. Short lines. Smaller park. Great food. Less expensive.",
          "Knott's Scary Farm: for kids? My review: The employees are honestly not trying to scare children. Our 6, 9, 11 and 13 year old enjoy the ambiance and the potential of being scared, but are generally left alone. The mazes can be very \u2026",
          "The park is pricey, as with all parks now. But it's a great place to take the kids to. Small children can hang out at camp Snoopy, and if they have a liking for thrill rides there are a few bigger rides they can get on. I took my 9 and 6 \u2026",
          "Place to go for small lines and a variety of thrilling coasters...lots of fun things for younger kids too!",
          "After 25 year absence the park is still fun and I still recommend going but a few rides seem down for renovations.\n\nStill a good day trip for family and friends.",
          "It was so fun!! That was my 1st time and I went with my class. The rides were fun and scary. Also the food there is good and they have Starbucks so if you go you know and can get some but the thing is the lines are so big and you have to \u2026",
          "It might be better other times of the year, but do NOT go the week after Christmas.  The lines for the rides are bad, but bearable. And I understand those get long with crowds. What is really horrible is the food lines.  We were there a few \u2026",
          "The theming here is phenomenal, the cozy atmosphere near camp snoopy beats Disneyland in my book.\nFun rides for the whole family, and some great ones for coaster enthusiasts. \nAll the rides are very smooth and never hurt, really such a blast to be here.",
          "Great family fun, food pass is greatly recommend one pass could easily feed a couple for the whole day.",
          "I went there twice and both times for the Scary Farm. It is pretty busy but very fun. I would advise to get the fast pass. It will spend more but you will also get to go to more mazes and rides. Last year I got the normal pass I only saw 3 \u2026",
          "Great food, fun rides...lines can be long but what amusement park isnt that way. Some of the games are expensive, food is decently prices. Just became pass holders, cant wait to visit all year long!",
          "The Independence Hall is a hidden gem. Wonderful piece of American History. Highly recommended to visit with the kiddos as they study our History. They also sell various books about the presidents, and replicas of the Construction. Must check the surroundings for hidden educational surprises. It's like walking in a time machine.",
          "We attended knott's Spooky Farm for the first time this year. It was fun! So many different shows to watch, costume contest, decorate your own cookies and pumpkins station! Kaylee at the face painting station was awesome and very patient! We will be back soon for the Christmas season!",
          "Knott's is my absolute favorite. I can bring my whole family for a day and everyone can find rides. They have great roller coasters but I truly enjoy the western town. It's the only theme park you can get into without breaking the bank and \u2026",
          "I've loved this place since before they added all the rides. Great place for a day of family fun.",
          "Best deal in Ca!  Season/year pass, meal plan and parking... worth every cent!  For less than half of other amusement parks.",
          "I went here for my birthday for the first time and it was so fun! It was an amazing one time experience and the rides are so fun and the food is so delicious! I highly recommend going here for family time.",
          "Never seems to disappoint. This place has been my go-to over Disney many times over. One just needs to go early or rather late to avoid the crowds. Also would like for healthier options for food. I'm plant based and the options are very few and far in between. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",
          "Great place. Like it better than D-land. Rides are bigger and faster and place is less expensive than Disneyland.",
          "It's like Disney for the lower middle class! LOL.  In all seriousness, it's rarely crowded when we go.  Parking is a little weird, but this place is great.  APs are very affordable.",
          "One of the greatest theme parks I have ever visited! I very much loved the Ghost Rider and the Silver Bullet, unfortunately my time was cut short could never ride them again.",
          "We attended \"Knott's Scary Farm\" during the Halloween season. It was really well done! They definitely need to work on crowd control outside the gate. That was a little too scary. But inside it was a ball!",
          "This is a fun place we went early around 10 am  on a Wednesday we got a good parking spot and there was not many people me and my husband had a lot of fun there is rides for small children and for teenagers and adult they have a bakery and \u2026",
          "Love having a pass. I can go for a few hours during the week and enjoy the short lines",
          "Excellent place for a family to have fun... It's inexpensive compare to Disneyland the kids had fun and it was overall an awesome experience will definitely go again",
          "I loved the Veterans discount that was given. Two free tickets plus my kids tickets for $42 each. That was a lot better than my wife's discount at $52 a ticket. I will definitely come next year for the awesome deal. The park wasn't as \u2026",
          "This amusement park was so much fun! Add in the app to find wait times and it made the experience even better. The app wasn't always accurate, but it was close enough that we still knew what we were in for. The food was amazing, a good \u2026",
          "Day after Thanksgiving fun. Beautiful weather and day spent with my family. Love Love Love this theme park; the best around. Wish I could stay here all weekend.",
          "I love this place! So much fun!",
          "Definitely for the kid at heart. Many coasters and nice area for smaller kids in peanuts section. Has a cowboy western theme but does have a surfer part also.",
          "I went to Knott's scary farm I honestly recommend this!!!! I sort of wish it could have been open all night. To be honest like when you have you highschool grad night. Can't wait to go back next year but this time I will be doing the pass and fast track",
          "My first impression of Knott's Berry Farm as we entered was amazement at how shockingly clean and well kept the park is as a whole. \n\nThe rides are a lot of fun. They're not  the biggest in the nation, but the lines didn't surpass an hour \u2026",
          "Wife hit 182 bpm on a ride. That should be enough said for the thrill seekers. Awesome roller coaster selection here.",
          "Always go for military days! Had the best day ever. Wasnt too hot, not crowded. First time we went with out it being Christmas time. Missed the crafts, but worth missing the crowd! May go again to see the crafts! :)",
          "Still a favorite!.....\n\nNot over priced, very clean, great staff and good value for your $.\n\nIf they would heed one suggestion?, More bathrooms, specially ladies rooms, long lines for them, not fun for anyone!.\n\nStop by and check it out!, Still a very good place to visit!....",
          "A great mix of rides and attractions that would appeal to thrill seekers and sane folks alike. \ud83d\ude09",
          "Awesome park. Super nice employees too. No complaints at all!",
          "I don\u2019t know if they want to be in business or not. They do not operate on hours for normal people. Still a great place to go",
          "My favorite local theme park! There's rides for all ages, the food is great, and the staff is friendly! The water park is great too! The season passes are a good investment if you live close.",
          "Super stoked to have the park to ourselves, not really but sure felt like it! Not hot not cold, everyone was nice. Like an amusement park should be!!! Was the icing on my daughter's fifth birthday!",
          "Love Knott's Berry Farm in the winter time I tell you you guys really put on a great show I really enjoyed the food and festivities and you ended it with a bang with the snow I really enjoyed myself very family-orientated not too many \u2026",
          "We really enjoy the cross-section of rides. There's literally everything to ride, from the thrill-seeker, to an infant, something for all the family. I also LOVE that there actually is an off season, when things are a little less busy and you truly can ride everything in a day. This park is a better value for the coaster junkie in me!",
          "We had such a great time here today. we've been all the amusement parks in southern California but we haven't been to Knott's Berry farm for years and years. we were planning to go to universal but friends tipped us that it's been really \u2026",
          "Really cute place to go. We got family passes but the only down part are the restrooms they smell very very bad. And now I am pregnant and it is even more dreadful to go in there. We moms in line were talking about how bad it smelled all of the time. Would have given 5 stars if the sanitation part was in place.",
          "Love this place. I cant ride any of the coasters because they are way to crazy for me but still fun.",
          "So much fun.  Lots of history and so much to do.. lines move fast and people are all super friendly",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is a great family trip for everyone & anyone..  I like the rides that I can go on..  But, it would be nice for the food prices to be a little bit lower..  I don't eat a lot, but the fast food areas are O.K..  I did have a great day with my family....   \u2600\ud83d\udc6a\ud83d\udc6a\ud83d\udc6a\ud83d\udc6a\ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf71\ud83c\udf72\ud83c\udf72\ud83c\udf72\u2615\u2615\u2615",
          "I went to scary farm, let me tell you I scare very easily, now with that said this was the best time I have had at an amusement park, it was scary but it was fun scary. It is so much fun I can't wait to go back all through the season, and \u2026",
          "I have to say that Knott\u2019s Berry Farm is an enjoyable amusement park. First off, it\u2019s way cheaper then Disneyland and has good quality food. I had Chicken to Go and my god,\nwas it good! I ordered the Mrs. Knott\u2019s bucket with mashed potatoes \u2026",
          "Gotta say this place has stayed true to its roots, prices are reasonable, and its always fun to shop at the little stores",

          "Lots of fun and food at reasonable prices. Season passes are a great deal for your dollar.",
          "We love knotts for a entire day of family fun!\nDefinitely recommend annual passes with the meal plan! There are various food choices and Entertainment has gotten better this year. Hopefully they bring back parades.  They can definitely \u2026",
          "I always have a good time. The key is ride the ghost rider first.. then after any ride. It does have strict rules on weather so be conscious of how the day is looking because, they will shut down some rides.",
          "So many lovely snoopy! Try their fried chicken before you go home.",
          "Always a perfect getaway, to be a kid .. good food at the many restaurants, season passes always a big plus . For us adults alcohol on tap \ud83c\udf7b, to enjoy the day . And towards the end of the night don\u2019t forget the Funnel cake \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\uddc1.",

          "Great rides, not crowded, great variety of rides. Would love to go again.",
          "We love going when we can afford it, however the employees are so unhappy there, they must really hate their jobs most shops or ride attendants are Pretty Rude and nothing at all is even cheap or affordable for American people. So much of a \u2026",
          "Amazing amusement park. Tickets are way cheaper compare to Universal. I went here for Halloween and had such a great time. I didn\u2019t go to all the mazes because wait line is quite long. It might be worth it to buy the vip tickets. Parking is a little pain in the buns since they don\u2019t have great directions. Still highly recommend tho.",
          "I love Knott's Berry Farm and going to the amusement park this time of year. The weather is perfect, not so darn busy and I am a dog guy!!! I love SNOOPY and the PEANUTS gang! Awesome people and very clean.",

          "We had disney lite on a Tuesday afternoon. It's like the fair, but it's clean and there are legit thrill rides. It doesn't feel low budget, it does feel small, which is kind of fun. It's cheaper and less glamorous than it's neighbor, it's \u2026",
          "It's good fun family-friendly place with many activities: including many seasonal shows, food, shopping, rides and crafts.  I especially enjoyed Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Caroland Marley's Wings performances that involve audience participation.",
          "Good old fun place to visit. The price is reasonable compared to other amusement parks and the size of the park was just right for one days trip. Make you want to come back.",
          "It is great for family fun but most if the rides if not all \"extreme\" which may not suit all members of your group. Financially though it beats Disneyland.",

          "My family and I love this place. The employees are fun spirited and helpful and the rides are a blast! I grew up going to Cedar Point and found out they also own Knott's. Also, the price is much more affordable than Disneyland or any other theme parks in LA.",

          "Always a great time here we have had a season pass for 2 years now. My 5year old daughter loves it. So does my 10 month old.",
          "THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. we go almost every year all the family together! the rides and food are the best part of it all",
          "Really fun rides, I had a blast here with my family. I was expecting shorter lines, but they're all pretty long.",
          "Very fun park and honestly pretty inexpensive; the prices are a lot lower than some other amusement parks in SoCal. Knott\u2019s Scary Farm is always great. They have great rides here for everyone. Mrs. Knott\u2019s Chicken Dinner Restaurant (right outside the park gates) is FANTASTIC, probably some of the best fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.",
          "Whole family had a blast. The fast pass was super helpful but expensive. Great coasters.",
          "I have a family of 8 that went. We had half a loaf of bread, peanut butter and jelly for a snack and security told me I could go through unless the sandwiches were made, which took 10 minutes. Then when we get to the ticket both with our go \u2026",
          "Family get together for first time and it was fun. We can't wait to do it again",
          "If you ever need a theme park fix, this is an affordable one to go to! Attractions are fun and food is good. They're always trying to improve the park so they will add/remove/renovate rides frequently which makes infrequent visits refreshing. Shows are fun and worth the trip for as well!",
          "Knott's Berry Farm is and has been a fun place to go with friends and family. We went during the 2019 Christmas season and was (like every year) decorated nicely. Check out my Instagram I'm a commission painter. @bigguynoir thanks",
          "Go to guest services and say you have conditions that dont allow you to stand in line for too long and they give you like a fast pass so you can just come back and get on"

        "wiki": "The Disneyland Resort, commonly known as Disneyland, is an entertainment resort in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and Products division and is home to two theme parks (Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure), three hotels, and a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex known as Downtown Disney.\nThe resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s. When it opened to guests on July 17, 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its 100-acre parking lot (which had 15,167 spaces), and the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather. After the success with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Disney acquired large parcels of land adjacent to Disneyland to apply the same business model in Anaheim.\nDuring the expansion, the property was named the Disneyland Resort to encompass the entire complex, while the original theme park was named Disneyland Park. The company purchased the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather Company and the Pan Pacific Hotel from the Tokyu Group. The Pan Pacific Hotel became Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel in 2000. In 2001 the property saw the addition of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, a second theme park, named Disney California Adventure, and the Downtown Disney shopping, dining, and entertainment area.\n\n\n== History of Disneyland ==\n\n\n=== Concept and construction ===\n\nWalt Disney's early concepts for an amusement park called for a \"Mickey Mouse Park\" located adjacent to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank (presently the site of the West Coast headquarters of ABC). As new ideas emerged, Walt and his brother Roy realized that the Burbank location would be too small for the project, and hired a consultant from Stanford Research Institute to provide them with information on locations and economic feasibility. The consultant recommended a remote location in Anaheim, adjacent to the then-under-construction Santa Ana Freeway. The consultant correctly predicted that the location \u2013 covered by orange groves at the time \u2013 would become the population center of Southern California. Since the location was far from Southern California population centers in the 1950s, Walt Disney wanted to build a hotel so that Disneyland visitors traveling long distances could stay overnight. However, the park had depleted his financial resources, so he negotiated a deal with Hollywood producer Jack Wrather in which he would build and operate a hotel called the Disneyland Hotel across the street from Disneyland.\n\n\n=== 1955\u20131998: one park, one hotel ===\nDisneyland opened on July 17, 1955, with a televised press preview event on ABC. Despite the disastrous event, later dubbed \"Black Sunday\", during which several rides broke down and other mishaps occurred, Disneyland became a huge success in its first year of operation. The hotel, which opened three months after the park, enjoyed similar success. Walt Disney wanted to build more facilities for Disneyland visitors to stay in Anaheim, but since his financial resources were drained, entrepreneurs established their own hotels in the area surrounding the park and hotel to capitalize on Disneyland's success.\n\nTo Walt Disney's dismay, the city of Anaheim was lax in restricting their construction, eager for the tax revenue generated by more hotels in the city. The area surrounding Disneyland became the atmosphere of colorful lights, flashy neon signs, and then-popular Googie architecture that he wanted to avoid (and which years earlier had caused the city of Burbank to deny his initial request to build his project in Burbank). The Anaheim Convention Center was built across the street from Disneyland's original parking lot, and residences were constructed in the area as part of the city's growth in the late 20th century. Eventually, Disneyland was \"boxed in\", a factor which would later lead Walt Disney to acquire a significantly larger parcel of land for the construction of Walt Disney World. The Walt Disney Company gradually acquired the land west of the park, notably the Disneyland Hotel in 1989 following Jack Wrather's death in 1984, the Pan Pacific Hotel (now Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel) in 1995, and several properties north of the Disneyland Hotel in the mid to late 1990s.\n\n\n=== 1990s: planning an expansion ===\nAfter Walt's and Roy's deaths in 1966 and 1971, respectively, the Walt Disney Company would go on to achieve success with the multi-park, multi-hotel resort complex business model of Walt Disney World in Florida, which opened in 1971. In the 1990s, Disney decided to turn Disneyland into a similar multi-park, multi-hotel resort destination. In 1991, Disney announced plans to build WestCOT, a theme park based on Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center, on the site of the original Disneyland parking lot. Its estimated cost was US$3 billion, largely due to the cost of land that Disney would need to acquire. With the new Euro Disney Resort, which opened in 1992, becoming a financial and public relations albatross for the company, Disney was unable to finance the project, and cancelled WestCOT in 1995. That summer, Disney executives gathered in Aspen, Colorado for a 3-day retreat, where they came up with the idea for a California-themed park, dubbed Disney's California Adventure Park, to be built on the same site slated for WestCOT. $1.4 billion was budgeted to build the park, a retail district, and hotels.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132019: Disneyland Resort complex ===\n\nIn January 2015, Tom Staggs, Disney Parks chair, and Steve Davison, VP of Park Entertainment, announced upcoming changes to the park to celebrate the park's 60th anniversary. The changes began on May 22, 2015, and ran for sixteen months. The updates included an updated World of Color water show, Paint the Night parade, and a new fireworks show titled Disneyland Forever. Disney California Adventure also received a makeover, with Condor Flats remade into Grizzly Peak Airfield and Soarin' Over California equipped with a new laser projection system. Peter Pan's Flight reopened on July 1.\nIn October 2017, Disney announced a new Pixar Pals parking structure for the resort, which includes a 6,500-space parking structure, and a new transportation hub, which opened in July 2019. The parking structure opened in June 2019 and is now used daily.\nIn August 2015, it was announced that Disneyland Park would receive a 14-acre Star Wars-themed land scheduled to open in 2019. It opened on May 31, 2019. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is home of two attractions, Rise of the Resistance and Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run.\n\n\n=== Future expansion ===\nIn March 2018, it was announced that A Bug's Land would close in September 2018. It will be replaced by Avengers Campus which is set to open July 18, 2020.Disney announced plans to build a fourth hotel at the resort in 2016, slated for an opening in 2021.  In August 2018, the hotel was placed on hold indefinitely because of a dispute with the city of Anaheim, which concerned a tax rebate that would have subsidized the hotel's construction. Later, the hotel was cancelled as Disney and Anaheim could not come to an agreement on the tax rebate.\nIn April 2019, Disneyland announced that Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway would be coming to Disneyland in 2022. The attraction will go behind Mickey's Toontown in a former backstage area, but much of Toontown will remain the same.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Disneyland Resort is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, in an area branded by the city as the Anaheim Resort near the border of neighboring Garden Grove. The resort is generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north. Interstate 5 borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner.\nNot all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north-south route and provides access to the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey & Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney.\nSpecial offramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit access into and out of the Mickey & Friends parking garage during peak morning and evening traffic times. The official address of the resort is 1313 South Harbor Boulevard; the address number is a Hidden Mickey.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nDisneyland Park, the original theme park built by Walt Disney, which opened on July 17, 1955.\nDisney California Adventure Park, a theme park based on the history and culture of California, which opened on February 8, 2001.\n\n\n=== Shopping, dining, and entertainment ===\nDowntown Disney, an outdoor retail, dining, and entertainment district located between the entrance promenade of the Disneyland Resort theme parks and the Disneyland Hotel.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nDisneyland Hotel, the original hotel built by Jack Wrather which opened on October 5, 1955, and was acquired by Disney in 1988.\nDisney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, based on the craftsman style of architecture of the early 1900s, which opened on January 2, 2001.\nDisney's Paradise Pier Hotel, a hotel themed after the section of Disney California Adventure it overlooks, which opened in 1984 as the Emerald of Anaheim, later changing its name to the Disneyland Pacific Hotel in 1995 after its acquisition by Disney, and finally opening under its current name and theme on December 15, 2000.\n\n\n== Attendance ==\nThe 2019 issue of \"TEA/AECOM 2018 Theme Index and Museum Index: The Global Attractions Attendance Report\" reported the following attendance estimates for 2018 compiled by the Themed Entertainment Association:\n\nDisneyland: 18,666,000 visits (No. 2 worldwide/in the US, up 2% from 2017)\nDisney's California Adventure: 9,861,000 visits (No. 11 worldwide/No. 7 in the US, up 3% from 2017)\n\n\n== Ticket prices ==\nApproximately 60,000 people visited the park on Disneyland's opening day, July 17, 1955, when park admission was priced at $1 for adults and $0.5 for children. This did not include access to rides and other individual attractions; attraction tickets could be purchased separately for $0.1 to $0.35. Single attraction tickets were permanently eliminated in June 1982; access to all the park's attractions was henceforth included in the price of park admission tickets.\nAdmission prices have greatly increased since the gates first opened, due in part to inflation, the continuing construction and renovation of attractions, and the addition of a second theme park, Disney California Adventure. As of 17 January 2020, one-day \"Park Hopper\" tickets, allowing entry to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure, are priced between $154 (on \"Value\" days) & $199 (on \"Peak\" days) for adults, and between $148 (\"Value\") & $191 (\"Peak\") for children. Visitors can also purchase one-park tickets and multi-day tickets.\nIn addition to daily tickets, in 1984 the Premium Annual Passport was introduced to the public. The Premium Annual Passport granted daily entry for a year at a time for $65 for adults and $49 for children. As of 2020, there are five different types of Annual Passports available for purchase, which are the Disney Signature Plus Passport ($1,449), the Disney Signature Passport ($1,199), the Disney Deluxe Passport ($829), the Disney Flex Passport ($649), and the Disney Southern California Select Passport ($399).\n\n\n== Management ==\n\n\n=== Executives ===\nThe president of Disneyland Resort is Ken Potrock.

They are colloquially known by their radio call signs, which usually contain the manager's department name (e.g., \"Merch\", \"Foods\") and an identifying number. Usually \"One\" denotes the manager in charge of that department for Disneyland Park, \"Two\" denotes the same for Disney California Adventure, \"Three\" denotes the same for the resort hotels, and \"Four\" denotes the same for Downtown Disney.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIncidents at Disney parks\nList of Disney attractions that were never built\nRail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n Disneyland Resort travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "Disney theme parks in general , are what they are, and either you long forthem or absolutely hate them, but the Star Wars land that was created is an absolute must see. The entire area recreated truly looks,feels, and sounds like a different planet,with amazing attention to",
          "A great place to visit. Be prepared to line up for quite a while to get on the rides unless you use fast pass or go on the single rider sections. A must place to visit if you\u2019re in California.",
          "There is a line for security, there is a line to get in, there is a line for the rides, lines to eat food, airlines to take pictures a famous areas and characters, there are lines to get into lines, and massive crowds to see the parade. The only thing that does not have a line",
          "Expected more from Disneyland, was very disappointed with the we the maxpass works because it doesn't work there are areas in the park where you have no cell phone signal there are issues if you buy it later than 10 in the morning and overall just a waste of money",
          "Great place with great service. Staff go above and beyond to make people comfortable and happy. Best experience for the entire family.",
          "It had been 9 years since our last visit, but our first time when it was decorated for Christmas. We were here for two days, which was close to enough time as Disneyland is nowhere near the size of Disney World. The decorations were amazing. There was a pretty good crowd there",
          "Staying in one of the hotels inside the area makes a difference. It allows you to enjoy the parks more and helps when you want to rest for a while",
          "It was great, lots of places to sit if you need to rest. Everyone had a smile, everyone was so nice. I highly recommend for solo or family",
          "Absolutely love Disneyland at Christmas time. So magical with all the Christmas decorations and all the characters dressed up for christmas time. The show of color at California adventure was amazing",
          "Fairly quick to get through ebtrance and Park Hop apart from the Friday when a lot of new families seemed to be arriving. Needed more gates open Christmas parade is sweet. Watch out for the dancing reindeer. Queues for rides were reasonable with fast passes available for most",
          "Couldn't find Disneyland parks to make a review maybe that's intentional from Disney. If you hate to wait in lines Disney is not for you. You have to wait in line for at least 30 45 minutes for security, and then another 10 to 15 minutes to get into the park. And Disney is",
          "I tried to make a simple online purchase of tickets to DisneyLand. I'll make the story short though it was over 4 hours online and on phone and still hadn't resolved. All my attempts to but tickets online failed - App, website...all failed. Multiple times. As I called customer",
          "The best Disneyland we have been too. They do it better than the other Disneys around the world. Awesome atmosphere and friendly staff all around the park!",

          "But I have to admit, it wasn't the magical place I remembered from a few decades ago. And to be fair, it was raining all day (Thanksgiving day) so most of it was viewed through the opening in a rain poncho. It was still very crowded in spite of the weather. Lines were long and",
          "There is a lot here crammed into a small footprint.If you look at the park from above its quite small.I see some people with one or two year olds,dont wast your time wait until they hit at least six for the big fun...oh wait its not the kids you are there for they are just along",
          "I always get the multiple day flex-pass so I'm not limited on moving from park to park. You can see what you like from each park and decide what you want to do from minute to minute. The attention to detail in every aspect of Disneyland is really something to experience!",
          "My husband and I recently visited Disneyland with our adult son and his twin boys. It was wonderful to watch our grandsons experience the Disney magic for the very first time.",
          "What a colossal disappointment: Disneyland was overcrowded, which caused long lines and completely ruined my experience! I will never go back! What a ripoff!!!",
          "Our second time, this time we did November so we could see the Christmas shows and decorations. We loved it, especially at night, as it looks magical when it's lit up. We took it easy this time, wandering in and out during the days. We use Single Rider whenever possible- it gets",
          "I can\u2019t say anything negative. Disneyland always meets my expectations. I can\u2019t help but smile from ear to ear while I am there. It reminds me of so many happy times.",
          "The singles line is often a bit hidden - look for it! Often a couple can get on the same ride together, in much less time than in the standby line. Also, it's a good time to do the water rides in the cooler weather as there will be less people.",
          "Had a great 3 days at the parks. Hopper is the way to go. Maxipass is the way to go for mobile fast pass. Game changer for mobile food pick up. Lines weren\u2019t too bad. Go early and stay late.",
          "We brought our nine year old for his first visit (that he\u2019s old enough to remember) during Thanksgiving week! He was obsessed with Star Wars Galaxy\u2019s Edge and the memories of building his custom lightsaber will last a lifetime. Maxpass is definitely worth the extra fee - being",
          "We visited DL for three days. One day was cold and rainy. Do not ride the Ferris Wheel when cold and rainy. Bad idea. Lines were not too bad but we had Max Pass. Star Wars land was amazing. The ride, Smugglers Rub, was a little under-whelming. We had a good time.",
          "We took our 4 year old son to Disneyland park on a 3 day visit for his birthday. It was a first time visit for all of us and we were impressed, so upgraded to annual pass. On our next 2 day visit during Thanksgiving week it was mayhem. The place was packed to the limit. The",
          "We just love it! The best place to go with kids. All the employees nice and smiling, everyone willing to help you. Nice food everywhere, clean restrooms even on a busy day. Great shopping.",
          "1st time to Disneyland. It was a magical mom and daughter trip. We really enjoyed ourselves and had so much fun. There were things we got to do that Disney World didn\u2019t have. Would love to go back in the future.",
          "My husband and I visited Disney yesterday. Even with Fast Max, we only were able to ride on Hyperspace mountain and Big Thunder railroad. I had a blast dinging Pluto. He was such a gentlemen posing for Photos with me. He even got my husband involved. The weather was great.",
          "Great place to experience if you get the chance. The line ups are incredibly long at times but a great must do experience for families. The fun vibe around the place is awesome. Maxi fast pass is worth it on busy days.",
          "We found the park to be under staffed this visit. There didnt seem to be as many characters this time. Overall, the cast members seemed rather grumpy and that was disappointing. We will stick to Disney world.",
          "Disneyland has lost its mind. The prices Disneyland charges for what can only be classified as crap food with crap service is mind boggling. The quality of the food is way below the prices. I mean McDonalds could double their prices and still be worthy of your money over",
          "This is probably the 50th time we visited Disneyland and it always lives up to the hype every single time!! My daughter absolutely loves Disneyland she just loves it",
          "Recently visited with friends who had not been before, we could be described as senior citizens and the 3 day pass was excellent value. The new Star Wars Attraction should not be missed. Whilst I have been there many times Disneyland is always great entertainment. We had a",
          "Loved Disneyland. Very organized, friendly staff. Get the Maxpass if you want to go on the big popular rides.",
          "Disney is amazing. Great rides, lovely place. Great fun for all the family (8 y.o. girl, 11 y.o. boy and mum and dad).",
          "This was my first time visiting but have been to Disney World over 20 times since we live on the east coast. Definitely utilized the MaxPass to the fullest. I still prefer the Magic Bands vs using my phone all day to scan my passes. 3 of us were using my charger and our phones",
          "I am not an amusement park fan, because I don\u2019t like crowds. There are numerous rules There a lot of rules here and now I know why. This keeps structure and prevents chaos, and for that they should be commended. We got the fast pass and would NEVER go without. I feel like you",
          "My third visit to this park over a number of years and I can\u2019t get enough. Perfect for all ages, there are lockers for storage at the front of the park, plenty of stroller parking, sizeable, clean rest rooms with baby change facilities. Heaps of seating for eating in or take out",
          "We had a great time on our visit. We used the fast pass for the popular rides. It\u2019s just too darn expensive.",
          "We had 2 fabulous days at Disneyland and one day at California Adventure. The experience was great but it\u2019s so busy here. Anytime after midday and the crowds are large and the wait times get long. Just walking around the park can be tough, strollers everywhere and people",
          "Decided o take advantage of our ten night stay in Cancun and pick up five days to visit Disney and undertake some shopping, I must say that In comparison to Visiting Disney in Florida last November, this one is clearly better, we purchased a Hopper pass for this Park. We",

          "Visited on a Sunday in November and had a great day. Galaxy\u2019s edge is superb and really well put together. The only negative I have is that the parades were pretty lame. Having seen the parades in Disneyland Paris I was expecting much more. All in all though we thoroughly",
          "We went in the off season and couldn't have picked a better time to go. The park was never overly crowded, even in the new Star Wars park which was our main reason for going. We definitely used our MaxPass purchase too",
          "We hit the park as soon as the Convention ended on a Friday afternoon. This was my first time at the original Disney Park and I was not disappointed. Food at the restaurants was very good and service was excellent. The new Star Wars Galaxy Edge was fantastic and the 40 minute",

          "Our granddaughters first trip to Disneyland Resort in California. Their ages are 6, 7, & 8 and perfect ages to do rides and all the walking without much trouble. Each of them had favorite rides. Using the Maxpass/Fastpass is great for photos plus the lineups and I highly",

          "My husband, daughter and our twin 5 year old grandchild went for the boys 5th birthday. It was so much fun. The rides , the park, Main Street it was great. We all had an amazing time. My husband especially like the new Star Wars world. The kids loved tune town and the",
          "No matter what your age you can run around like a kid and have a ball. The churros and frozen lemonade are delicious. Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain are my favorite rides. Plus around Halloween and the Holidays the park is even more decorated.",
          "Its great. Crowded?Yes but not as daunting as I thought it would be. Everything is very well organised and there are plenty of helpful staff and cats members. Take advantage of the quick ticketting system for ride called Fast Pass, just for those popular rides. I found the lines",
          "We choose to visit Disneyland at the end of October to experience Halloween and try to catch Christmas as well. All the information told us after Halloween it wouldn\u2019t be busy but for me it was crowded which didn\u2019t make the experience pleasant. The food was average with all the",
          "You can't go wrong with Disney anything. The park is always super clean. Food is a bit pricey but hey, it's Disneyland and California. But I will say the food we had was very good despite the price. We went to the Oogie Boogie night at the California Adventure and it was",

          "Family trip that lived up to the expectations. The park itself is amazing, rides for all ages. The staff always smile and super helpful. The characters are amazing and put smile on so many faces. Starwars area was unbelievable. The shows they put on and engaging with the",
          "I LOVE Disney and Disneyland. It has definitely gotten way more crowded with every passing year. Max passes are your friend and SO worth the extra money! The max passes allowed us to go on the highly popular rides with little and sometimes (rarely) no wait. If you have a",
          "This was our first trip in six years. There were many changes, some old that we missed - like the light parade, some new and great. We went Nov 4 and the crowds were probably as low as they ever were this year. There was still some Hallloween, and just beginning to put up",

It\u2019s also not as good as Disneyworld, it feels quite cramped in",
          "Well, i have been a Disneyland AP holder for many years and the parks here in SoCal, are awesome. Well they are a little expensive yes and a little crowded yes, but the magic and the memories they leave are incomparable to any other park or epxerience.",
          "Get the MaxPass. Look online (YouTube) learn how to use it. Costs a bit extra but worth it. Did I mention get MaxPass? Wait, don\u2019t get MaxPass. I\u2019ve just let slip the secret. Sorry those that have MaxPass. Don\u2019t get the MaxPass.",
          "I prefer Disneyland to WDW simply because of it\u2019s size. Disneyland, California Adventure, and Downtown Disney are all right there together and easily accessible by walking instead of having to wait on a monorail, bus, boat, etc.",
          "We travelled with our son, his wife and 2 granddaughters age 7 and 9. The park was a hoot and sure brought out the little kids in us adults. To watch our granddaughters faces when meeting the Disney characters and on the rides was priceless! The only thing that we felt was",

          "Standardization has hurt Disneyland. All the shops carry much the same things, which limits one's interest in them. It's still a beautiful park - nicer than Orlando - but it's overcrowded, overpriced and the new stuff isn't all that great. Unless you are a huge Star Wars fan,",
          "This is the 1st time I have been to disneyland with my family. (My husband's 3rd time. Went twice as a child) I didn't feel it was anything special. Over crowded. Used maxpass on the 1st day. Felt it was a waste. We found just using fast pass was just as good. Kids",

          "I was very disappointed after my visit to Disneyland. Basically, it is an overpriced shopping mall with a $150+/day admission fee. Almost all of the rides had between a 40 minute and 2 hour (!) wait, and many of them did not even have a fast pass option. This was on a weekday",
          "This was charming and it made me wish for the older days of the Disney World without all the hoopla that you have to go through in Florida now.",
          "You can do this park in a day. Compared with Disney World and Disneyland Paris, this is our least favorite. The atmosphere isn\u2019t nearly as magical. You could tell most of the employees were unhappy. I\u2019m not a fan of having to keep track of your paper ticket for multiple days. I",
          "It\u2019s too hot and too much waiting. The max pass only works for 1 ride at a time. I seriously have no reason to ever go back to this place. They also have elders working the lines to get in, and that makes it super slow.",
          "Who am I kidding? Disneyland is always going to be a fun place to go no matter when you go. But it's really frustrating when you go for a specific ride, when you get there and discover that the ride is closed for maintenance. :-( fortunately my favorite ride, pirates of the",

          "Disneyland is truly a magical adventure! It hold memories for me for practically my whole life. The attention to detail puts you in a fantasyland vacationland. It appeals to those who have happy memories and want to see some of the vintage original rides and those who want to",
          "We had Magic Morning passes but along with others could not find a line to get in. The signage was poor and we didn't get in until 7:30ish. Then we ran right to the ride we wanted and it was a 60 min wait already. We did the fast pass for a few rides we could with our 5 year",
          "Great place to spend with the family. Lines are long but move quickly. Choose you too choice rides for fast pass early since the more popular rides stop giving out fast pass hours before park closes. The Star War section at this park is awesome!",
          "They have done it right for over 60 years; how many businesses can be that consistent. It's extraordinary... I confess I do not cater the park when it is crowed. I just don't enjoy the crowds(which is most of the time), thus my review is based ONLY when there is little or no",

          "Traveled to SoCal with my small group of teenage Girl Scouts. Concierge was over-the-top helpful, as always, presenting 2 of my Girls with graduation plus another special badge to commemorate their last year as Girl Scouts. We opened and closed the park, having a great time.",
          "Disneyland is Disneyland! What can be said, but it is so much fun and wonderful. Lots of people, but the lines were not horrendous. We ate several meals there and several snacks. The Dole Whip was out of this world. The French Market had stew and corn chowder in bread bowls,",
          "Yes, it's sometimes crowded and the tickets are expensive, but there's no other place in the world like Disneyland. We last visited in September 2019 after most kids were back in school and on weekdays, so the crowds were not a problem. Our longest wait in line was 30 minutes",

          "I saved up for a year to take my kids and granddaughters to Disneyland. The day finally got here and I was so disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the smell of Main St. It didn\u2019t have the sweet smell of candy or baked goods. I didn\u2019t hear the fun music that plays while",

          "What more can you say about Disneyland? Even adults can smile all day. We had a two day tickets and still didn't manage to visit every section. We were fortunate enough to visit when there was no holiday and in the middle of the week so the lines where tolerable. If you di visit",
          "We were skeptical. I haven\u2019t been to Disney in over 30 years and wanted to take my kids (9 and 6 years old) so they have the memories. We figure this would be our first and last time going. Are there lines? Yes. Weren\u2019t as bad as we thought. The Indiana Jones ride at night had",

          "Fun to revisit old favourites, but best of all was Galaxy\u2019s Edge. I keep reading about the lack of crowds. It felt pretty much hopping to me. The attention to detail was great. 40 minute wait for the Smugglers Run was fine. A great 2 days.",
          "We enjoyed our 3 days at Disneyland. It was 10 years since we had last visited and was great to see it was still the magical place we fondly remembered. The food and drinks are expensive but it\u2019s all part of the experience. We had a very enjoyable 3 days at both parks and",

          "You need to arrive when the gates open as you will be there until closing if you have kids. We went on some rides more than once. The Star Wars theme area was awesome and if you are a fan this is a must. We highly recommend paying the extra $15 per person for the 'Max pass'.",

          "I was disappointed this time at Disneyland. We went off season on a Monday and Tuesday and it was so crowded we missed the electric light parade and the other shows. We used the fast pass which the app was very hard to understand at first. The rides weren\u2019t too bad typically",
          "I absolutely LOVE Disneyland park! This is the third or fourth time I have visited and I will be back again. I love the way it is totally immersive and you feel like you\u2019re in another world. It is the happiest place I know of! The attractions are wonderful and never seem to get",

          "We purchased 3 day park hopper tickets with MaxPass. This included Fast Pass by mobile phone, and the ability to download the Disney Photos. Because the park was fairly busy, this saved us some time in that we didn't have to go to attractions to pick up Fast Passes in person.",
          "Compared to Disneyworld, we loved the size of this park. The park hopper pass we actually used without being exhausted by the time you made it to the second park. The Magic Hours were not very beneficial as they had magic hours for ALL resorts not just the ones on property.",

          "We were unable to enjoy almost anything at Disney because of the outrageous crowds. Do they ever put a max on the number of people allowed in at any given time? Lines are so long that I oveheard children saying they spent as much as 3 hours waiting for just one popular",
          "I suggest to purchase a three day dual park ticket to see both parks at liesure. You will need atleast one day for Disney California Adventure and two days for Disneyland Park. In my view, Park Hopping ticket is not necessary.",
          "We can not get enough of this magical place, it is my family's favorite destination to visit. No mater what age you are, the moment you step foot in the park you are engulfed in that feel good energy! The smell, the sounds and all the food and attractions, it is a combination",
          "First, fly into the Burbank Airport, saved us 100 dollars per ticket from Sacramento on Southwest compared to flying into Orange County. If you go to Galaxy's Edge, don't be disappointed, it is still a work in progress, take time to admire the intricate artwork and craftsmanship",

          "I have to say that with the max pass, it saved us a lot of time. Being a combination of fast pass (which saves time for standing in line) and the photo pass (which allows us to easily capture pictures and download them on the phone), I feel that the max pass is the way to go",
          "This was the first and is the classic. The Disneyland park is so family friendly and the California adventure park for older kids. The Halloween night was awesome with heaps of lollies /candy. The cast members are amazing and friendly. The new Star Wars area was awesome and well",

          "Been going to Disneyland since 1955. Yes I've seen allot of changes since 1955. Yes some changes did take time to adjust but those changes improved older rides. Only thing of concern is Bob Iger he needs to move on and that employees receive better pay and benefits",
          "The park is great to walk around and you can generally get into the shows, the kid rides and some of the simulator rides most of the other rides always had long wait times. The light show and fireworks display was simply amazing, well worth going back in the evening to see",

          "Looking at these reviews clearly shows you what's wrong with people and selfish expectations. People complaint that they show up late and can't be at the front of the line or front of the parking structure, or go where they want. I personally find Disney extremely democratic.",

          "Great fun - suspend reality and let your inner child have some fun. Can get a bit boring waiting in lines for rides but if you go at times when the crowds are smaller then this problem is reduced. Like everything similar, they know how to separate you from your dollars so beware",

          "We went for a quick two day visit. We enjoyed every minute. We love Disneyland and this trip reinforced that feeling. The new Star Wars land was awesome. The new tweaks to Space Mountain were great. We also had great food in the park. The one minus was the ridiculous",

          "We had a great time in Disneyland and really enjoyed the new Star Wars area. The only negative comment has to do with the numerous temporary ride closures that occurred throughout the day. That made it difficult to see and do everything In one area before heading of to another",
          "Been to Disneyland, Disney Paris, and Disney world. Adding the Star Wars edge is a great addition. Making a few changes in future land to accommodate Star Wars is a plus. Hyperspace ride is a great upgrade from space mountain. Good thing with Disney California- it\u2019s less",

          "This was my first time at Disneyland. I\u2019ve never been a big fan of amusement parks but Disney made me a believer. I felt like a kid again. Purchased a three day park hopper. Thursday was the least crowded but still not bad for Friday or Saturday. The park was very clean and the",
          "Nice visit not to crowded lines weren\u2019t bad! Monorail was shut down down between 11 am to 6 pm! Warm temperatures very minimal attraction shut down or breaking down! Nice souvenirs park was clean lots of cast members able to assist you",
          "The original Disney park and a must see. It\u2019s more suited to younger children but still a fun visit for all. The food options aren\u2019t exceptional but the overall experience is still fabulous. Max Pass is worth it if you want to do a lot of rides (and do use the app base case)",

          "We have visited Disney parks every year since our kids were young. This Disneyland park is so much fun. A day admittance May be expensive to some but with the amount of rides, shows, parades and fireworks, it is well worth it. Come early and stay late. The max pass is new",
          "After spending a fortune on the tickets this is a small price to pay for an absolute must, not only will you gain hours by not queuing you will save money not having to buy the photos (if you want them!) as you can just download them from the code. The app is also really useful",

          "We met family there and spent most of the day. We were disappointed that we missed the opening of Star Wars.",
          "Simply awesome. It was a dream come true. The rides, the shows, you name it and you won't be disappointed. It has two parks and you would want to keep two days in your hand to cover those. You can still cover the parks in one day but it will be tiresome and you would like to",

          "Happiest place on earth! Clean, great cast members and always new and improved with each visit! Never disappoints!!!",
          "Still the happiest place on earth. Even with all the specific instructions for gaining ride passes,  Galaxy's Edge and it's 2 rides really are remarkable. With unique eats in themed eateries and merch filled shops novices to Star Wars, hard core and non-fans alike will find themselves over the moon with the experience.",
          "The best trip you can go on! With the added black spire outpost it is the ultimate trip. The rise of resistance ride is godly and the size of it all really puts you in the universe. Plus with chewbacca wandering around, maybe trying to try on your messenger bag, it's the best fun you'll have in a long time.",
          "Disneyland is one of the happiest places in the world. Do I recommend going here? YES! There are so many adventures to be had and memories to be made. The atmosphere is super vibrant and filled with friendliness. The employees are always so \u2026",
          "Truly magical! I have always loved going ever since the first time! Great for people all ages. Amazing for family and friends. Would love to go again some day for both parks",
          "Such a great trip. We are big Disney Parks fans, and being from the East coast, getting to the original park is quite a trip for us. It was everything we were expecting and MUCH more. The cast members are great, parks are always clean, and all the attractions are fun. We love going to the parks to feel like kids again.",
          "My husband and I come here on a weekly basis to walk around and get some food. Disneyland has many things to do other than just rides. It\u2019s nice to just walk around and chill and people watch. We upgraded to signature pass recently. Definitely worth it if you\u2019re a local!!",
          "Rise of Resistance: Be ready! This ride only by reservation. You need to have a Disney app to be able to reserve your spot. Link your ticket to the app and at exact time the park open up join a group to secure your spot. You need to be in the Main Street to do it",
          "It's one of the happiest places on Earth. Pacific Whale Cafe is a great place to eat. We love salad in a bread bowl. I get the Chinese chicken salad, she gets the chicken, Apple Walnut salad. About 12 bucks each. Used mobile ordering via \u2026",
          "It's still a great place, 3 stars because someone at corporate has forgotten the first face we see is security,.  They have a primary job, but they also need to remember they are the first face the public sees.  Being treated like a suspect on your way in to the happiest place on Earth, says additional or remedial training is required.",
          "Disney brings the full experience. The rides are solid. The park is clean. MaxPass allows you to manage the lines. Food options are good. People are well behaved. Actors dressed like Disney characters are wonderful with the kids. It's expensive, so bring extra $ and don't stress about that part of it.",
          "It took us 10 years to have children and this was our first vacation to Disneyland with our family! We had a blast and the kids just love Disneyland!\ud83c\udff0 They love getting pictures\ud83d\udcf8 with all the characters and the entire Disneyland Christmas \u2026",
          "Was fabulous as always! Great rides. Friendly employees! Clean Park. Good food options. The new Star Wars ride is Epic and Brilliantly done! Best ride Ever!",
          "great place to take out the family and the children's as well. Note it has very high prices for he meal, and etc. Love Everything about it, i can not complain but beside had a great time with my daughter. She went crazy for her first time \u2026",
          "Perfect place for fun with the whole family! Definitely no matter what age you are! The kiddos have a great time like always! Lunch at The Blue Bayou is a must for us! Exceptionally well done food a bit on the high price but the food is \u2026",
          "What can you say about Disneyland, it is magical at any age. I have been coming here since I was 5 in 1964. It's grown so much. The changes are remarkable. I love still coming here and I am 60 now",
          "Of course this is the most wonderful place on Earth. We had 5 days here and enjoyed every one of them with over 26000 steps a day. Getting in even with long line-ups was very fast and the staff are always friendly and helpful. Always get \u2026",
          "Ive been here twice already and can't wait for next time! I love our home town Walt Disney World, but Disneyland truly has the better rides and more \"Magic\" in the experience. It definitely is pricey, but quality will always win out in the end. Truly a magical place. It's a must do if in the area or visiting LA.",
          "Amazing. I did not want to leave. This truly is the most happiest place on earth. We got 2 day hopper pass for both parks, and it was not enough to spend 1 day each in each of the parks. Need 2 more days each park to get everything in.",
          "My girlfriend and I go to Disney once a year. This time we got lucky and made it on the new Rise of the Resistance ride which was mind blowing. We also shelled out at Savis workshop and made our own custom light sabers which was also a fun \u2026",
          "What can I say about how truly magical a Disneyland experience is that hasn't already been said? A masterpiece of fun! 6/5 stars",
          "By far the happiest place on earth! Love it all, family is everything and Disneyland is a great place to come and enjoy it with family.\nChristmas season is the best time, but be ready for long lines almost every day.\nLoved Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, all the details, characters and the vibe.\nWe LOVE Disney.",
          "I love Disneyland! This last time we went in July was a lot of fun. We visited Star Wars land and I have to say it was incredible! I wish the lines weren\u2019t as long but it\u2019s Disneyland so it\u2019s expected. I can\u2019t wait for our next Disney trip!",
          "What can I say: it's Disneyland!!! If you love it, like I do, then you know that it is a really magical place somehow, filled with people who enjoy the rides, the incredible eye for detail in every corner of the park, and everything about \u2026",
          "It was great to do the after dark valentine's night. Fast lines and 99.9% adult couples. Also not too many people. Was able to ride all the rides we wanted with time to spare.",
          "A magical kingdom for sure. Rides and the atmosphere are second to none. Only complaint was food is priced as 5 star cuisine but a 2 star delivery . Plan on eating elsewhere",
          "Park was amazing to see but not wait so long for each thing. 2-3 hours for a ride is more than many can handle without difficulty. Fast pass is a mistake. Come to the park go in and ride when you get there be more efficient than people \u2026",
          "Great time.  Very crowded at California Adventure for me obvious reasons.  Only saw parts of the parade.  Looks fantastic.  Cast member Apple in Cars ride was great.  Thanks Apple for you kindness.",
          "Always has been, always will be the happiest place on Earth. Just can't give five stars though do to overcrowding. PLAN AHEAD! Do some research before planning your trip. Some days the park closes early...some days are busier than others. Travel smart, stay safe, have fun ;)",
          "It was an amazing trip, even though the Haunted Mansion was closed... we had reservations at the Blue Byou and the food was amazing! We visited Star Wars Land but most of our visit was near the Lake of America and New Orleans Square! So much fun! Definitely worth getting an Annual Pass!",
          "Disneyland Resort and Hotel is nice but not a 5 star in my book. The grounds are pretty but the hotel rooms are kind of small and can use some updating. The firework display and the twinkle lights are cute in the headboard. There is a seperate vanity area from the shower and toilet. Other than that pretty basic room with small TV.",
          "Fantastic place for all ages!!! Disneyland is our family's favorite vacation destination. It's expensive but can be done on a budget. I really appreciate that they allow outside food. Maxpass is worth the extra cost on crowded days. Cast \u2026",
          "It's a great place. The attention to detail of the star wars land is really cool but honestly it's chaos but that's the nature of Disney Land. I enjoyed my turkey leg and had a whole bunch of great memories to share when I got home but it was exhausting",
          "Either you later be Disney or you don't .\n\nBut I absolutely love Galaxy's edge. And can't wait to go again.  So coming from a guy who doesn't love Disney. That's the best recommendation I can give you. It's so otherworldly and all \u2026",
          "Prefer this Disney park over the Orlando one. Went on my birthday, so I got treated to a yummy, cute chocolate cupcake as a birthday present. Loved receiving \u201cFirst visit\u201d button and the birthday button.",
          "Disneyland was great! The cast members and staff were super friendly and helpful. My nieces and I had a great time and I will certainly go back. One day is just not enough time to do everything the park has to offer. Prices are rather high \u2026",
          "Lines were long but normal tickets u can scan for a fast pass for 3 rides I thought that was really cool. Overall great time my kiddo had a blast",
          "Everything about Disneyland and California Adventure is just magical. The new stuff like Galaxy's Edge, Frozen play, and Guardians of the Galaxy are really great additions to the parks. I'm sure to come back in a few years when Avengers Campus is open.",
          "Loved being here.   Yes Minnie Mouse will wake you up \ud83d\ude04for an early morning call.  \nYes you pay for the price but you will love it.",
          "Did food and wine expo at California Adventure today. Great deal..a must. Rained all morning and afternoon but still enjoyed It.",
          "Amazing time! The cast members staying in character throughout our time here made it such a memorable experience.  My whole family can't wait to go back!",
          "We had an awesome time! The staff and cast members go over and above to make it special for each kid! Lovely cashiers and retail people made it easy to find more shirts and merchandise! Thanks to all the people who work so hard to make it an awesome place to visit!",
          "We are annual passholders and love to come as a family instead of dinner and a movie we stroll through the park. Plus, we always get our steps in when we come. And our daughter loves it here too :P",
          "Amazing! So big we only did half and stayed all day! Definitely recommend more than one visit to see everything..  rides were very good and each merchandise store has something different!!",
          "We had a slow start to our day as we could not get our tickets to sync with our app; so we missed out on getting the Maxpass early enough to get earlier Fast Pass times for rides. Noticed the cast members are not as \"friendly\" nor do they \u2026",
          "The prices keep going up, and that makes the rest of it less appealing no matter how fun. If you have the ability to go without breaking the bank, it's a great place to spend time. Be nice, have fun, accept that there are likely waits no matter when you go, and you'll have a good time.",
          "Great place for kids and grandchildren. All the food we eat was very good. Just wish that they didn't have to bend you over at absolutely everything that you do at the parks and hotels.",
          "Is a very nice place, I give one star because in some rides my little girl did not reach the height by very little and it should not be a problem, but if you see that there were kids smaller than her going in to the ride then you know somenthing is not right. Other than that everything is good.",
          "It truly is the happiest place on Earth and if not the cast members will help put a smile on your face. There was a tiny moment when I wasn't feeling the most happiest but a cast member made a funny comment to me and made me happy right away and reminded me how special Disneyland is. \u2764\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udff0",
          "One too many people for the happiest place on earth. So much to explore for sure. If you have kids or love Disney characters in general, there\u2019s no reason not to like about this place. Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge was really impressive, but most of them were either stores selling a ton of merchandise or restaurants.",
          "It's Disneyland. It's the happiest (most expensive, hyperactive, sensory overloaded) place on Earth. Seriously. It's not a played out statement.\n\nWith the addition of Star Wars' Galaxy Edge, the entire park just feels a bit more relevant \u2026",
          "Disney is always top notch!\nI can't say enough about how well they take care of their properties... Clean, fun & friendly!\nDefinitely the happiest place on Earth!!!!",
          "Disney is Awesome. One of the best places in the world for family time my friend time. One of the happiest places around. Love the fast pass, you need to know how to us it to make it worth your time.",
          "Disneyland is always an amazing place to go, whether you go alone or with family or friends, the experience is always incredible and one that can't be recreated. Everything here is great, The food and snack stands have amazing food, even \u2026",
          "What can I say? It's Disney. The resort itself is very nice. The staff (the \"cast\") is very polite and attentive. And the amenities are absolutely fab!",
          "I've been going for years. This trip was unlike any I've encountered before. Not necessarily a good thing. Although It's a Small World is still my favourite ride and still brings a smile to my face. I wish others a happy experience.",
          "Everything was so nice... until Chewbacca don't let people take pictures whit him.. that was not nice..  He and his team should be a little nice whit the public. I love Disneyland , but I think this is the last time I take my family there.",
          "Got to hand it to Disneyland for always trying to continue to make a magical experience for all its guests. Still not something to go to very often. If you have small children definitely do not take them too often. Season passes are a horrible idea ruins the experience in the long-term. Seen at a time and time again",
          "I was kid again..had so much fun. Built me a droid. But very disappointing that we couldn't get to go on any of the star wars ride. Need to have fast pass for them.",
          "Definitely check  Disney calendar for high traffic times. Big holidays are a madhouse, but if you stay late and use Max pass you'll get on the rides.  It's an amazing place with incredible details! Go everywhere and into every store, they all have different merchandise! So amazing if you come prepared and well planned!",
          "There is so much to do. Can't do it in one day. Good food to eat. Fun rides to go on. Great attractions to see. And it you want to just sit and people watch, a wonderful place to do that.",
          "I have had the best Disney Experience. January is the best time to go especially during weekdays. We have lived off the snacks we brought, and take napping trips at the hotel around 2.",
          "Rise of the resistance was crazy good! One thing though, I was told you had to be on their WiFi to reserve a boarding pass, that isn't true, I used my own data on my phone and it worked perfectly. Second thing, if you want to get in the \u2026",
          "One of the funniest places to go. The employees make you feel special and are very kind to you. If you are still a kid, whether by age or at heart, you'll have fun",
          "Love Disneyland! Loved watching my kids experience the pure magic Disney has to offer. I would give it a 5 star rating except, I think the food is over priced for the very SMALL portions you get",
          "We love the comfort of this resort. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The pool and slides are amazing, the restaurants are delightful and the early entry into the Disneyland park is great!",
          "The food isn't that great and there aren't a lot of 5 and under rides. You start to feel like you're just walking through a giant gift shop. But that aside, the kids liked it.",
          "Disney world WAS my very favorite place. Though its my \"home\" park. Its not my favorite any more. Walt always wins. He's meant to, naturally. But you just can't get away from the nostalgia pulling you into every corner. Its literally my very favorite place.",
          "The Disneyland Resort, commonly known as Disneyland, is an entertainment resort in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and Products division and is home to two theme parks \u2026",
          "One of my most favorite places in the world to visit... I transform into a little kid/teenager inside every time we go there. I'd quit my job and move to California if we could afford to live there and work for Disney",
          "Always fun decorations for Christmas amazing. New Year's day was easiest to get on rides. I would recommend if you've never seen the lights you go.",
          "Love this place. Need to go.  Being the family.  Priced high but unbelievable experience.",
          "Disneyland! Hella expensive to get into and ... Older than what I recall it to be. But I love the energy I see from people around me, the actors as characters are very enthusiastic and play their roles well. There's always new things to \u2026",
          "Who doesn\u2019t love Disneyland, I guess plenty of people, but I love it. If you aren\u2019t worried about spending large amounts of money, you\u2019ll love the food. It\u2019s fun to look and try all the different kinds of foods that they have in each of the different locations in Disney. Disney doesn\u2019t have to be stressful if you plan to spend. Love it.",
          "Annual Pass holder here. Plan out your day in advance and get maxpass and you will have a great time even if it's a very busy day.\nDisney keeps it interesting with new food offerings that are fun and tasty!",
          "It is the happiest place in the world!! I enjoyed the experience here even tho I haven\u2019t watched much of Disney cartoons or movies. And roller coasters aren\u2019t too crazy.",
          "The Disneyland resort was definitely one of the most amazing experiences for both me and the kids. Everyone had the best time and nobody minded the wait. The food is impeccable, all disney related which adds more fun. Who knew that adults could enjoy Disneyland too? It proves that you're never too old for Disney. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udcab",
          "Beautiful, good rides for all ages and disability friendly, kinda pricey so make good use of your money, lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes, usually packed so if you don't handle crowds well it might be a problem. Nonetheless the \u2026",
          "$25 for parking? Why because a new structure was built? Not cool when no more reservations required but only 80 boarding groups for the day out of 10,000 possible groups currently in the park. I mean I am here and saved, due to not being \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with grand kids. Clean and well staffed with friendly people. Disney World is better if you can get to Florida.",
          "Disney provides a chance for anyone to have a good time. The park had entertainment choices for any child roller coasters, visual and auditory journeys, or inter active simulations. My kids enjoyed themselves every day.",
          "It was a fun place, and had many rides. The thing is though one ride the people said they didn't do child switch, but when I looked at the app it said they did. Other than other than that ot was real fun.",
          "Disneyland is a great resort. With their acquisition of Marvel characters for movies, I hope they'll add Marvel characters to the Resort. I'd love to take a photo between Black Panther and Snow White.",
          "It truly is magical.  2 days with our 14 year old nephew made him come alive.  2 days with our 18 year old nephew and the conversations were rich.  1 day as a couple and we were transported back to our dating days.  So many rich memories, \u2026",
          "A very magical place although very busy and we didn't get to go on the new Star wars ride because of poor planning  on Disneyland's part. All in all though my daughter had a great time.",
          "The parks were very nice but charter management was poor. Kids stand for several minutes waiting and charter would be pulled away. Waiting lines should be controlled. Master fast passes were great using the app. Map of park was not easy to use.",
          "It was very fun and thrilling, I'm rating 4 stars only because of some of the workers i have encountered. Some were nice, others had a very mean attitude that just makes you want to leave.",
          "Always have an amazing time no matter when i visit.",
          "\"Happiest place on earth\" is an absolute scam of a slogan.  Far too overcrowded, 45 minutes to an hour wait per ride, on a Tuesday, in the winter, on a school week.\n \nIt's simply impossible to enjoy the experience when everything is \u2026",
          "I've gone to Disneyland my whole life. While I love it, I'm finding that WDW seems to have a better Disney \"feel\". For as nice as Star Wars land is, it really isn't Disney...Cars Land is better. Grumpy staff at Blue Bayou this time put a damper on the visit as well.",
          "It really is magical. I can't wait to take more of my family and friends! I look forward to seeing more Avengers related stuff, too!",
          "Best place ever! Truly the happiest place on earth. My family and I went on a ride and my child had gotten a toy we had just purchase from the gift shop,  stolen from our stroller and a cast member saw her crying asked her what's wrong and \u2026",
          "Spent over $500 dollars but only went on 3 rides in one day ;-; i was waiting in lines that where 3 hours long. I have to admit they do put on some good shows but its utterly ridiculous on how much time i sit in line.",
          "Spent the whole day at California adventure. Incredicoster was awesome kids really liked it.  Guardians of the Galaxy  ride was our favorite.  Wait times were long but we used single rider line as they were shorter. If you don't mind not \u2026",
          "Loved the parade and. Staff. Park is too crowded to have the fun we used to. New drawf Sad replaced Happy . We had more fun at the Embassy Suite Pool.",
          "This would be a dream come true place for kids and adults alike but you end up spending an arm and a leg for tickets just to stand in line most of the day. They over sell the park and then you spend more time waiting in lines than doing anything fun. Not worth it for that one reason.",
          "They call it the happiest place on Earth for a reason. The whole experience was fantastic. A little expensive, but it was certainly worth the price for us.",
          "The new Star Wars Galaxy's Edge was awesome.  Went with my 6yo son for the opening of Rise of the Resistance and even though we couldn't get on the new ride, experiencing the new addition as well as building a custom lightsaber was a very \u2026",

          "Fun time. Good rides. Go on a shadow day for lower price and less crowded. Still a zoo but less. Make sure to get pictures.",

          "Just way to crowded for me, I'm going to have to find out what days and times would suit me better. Also I will pack my own food, 24 dollars for 2 hot dogs, I understand that Disney's pay roll probably requires the high prices but if I do go again I'll pack my food.",
          "Downtown Disney is a nice prelude to end the evening off. We arrived around 6 p.m. The parking situation was excellent. How they focused on their guests, finding your car at the end of the night was a breeze here. Parking lots, signs, \u2026",
          "I cannot get enough of this place! Although there were long lines, it was so worth it! Every ride is so fun!!! The new Star Wars experience is amazing! Disneyland is the best!",
          "We only visited downtown Disney this time. Still very nice. Took some nice Christmas activities. Ate at one of the popular restaurants .",
          "Disney is without a doubt a magical place to both make memories and drain your life savings in as little as a single night. I feel real bad for those who have not had a Disney experience. Bless them <3 I wish I was rich enough to share this experience with many. I love Disney. It would be a real dream to work there.",
          "Highly recommend. Always busy, no matter the time of year.\nMy kids love every aspect. Disney constantly out does itself. \nWish tickets were a little cheaper. But you get what you pay for.",
          "Disney continues to provide a quality experience, marred only by excessively high prices and long waits.  We took our 2 grandchildren to the Disneyland park in Anaheim.  We were able to only ride 3 rides and 1 attraction (Tarzan's tree \u2026",

I have app to scan my annual pass but I cant use to get discount I need my actual Disney pass card which doesn't make sense the point is not to carry my Disney pass. My kids love Disney but I feel I can spend my $ elsewhere and still have fun with them.",

          "Even though no one could feel their feet by the end of our 3-day journey, our entire family loved it! The park is immaculate. It is surreal to just walk into your childhood movies and feel as if you're part of that world.",

          "I did not do a lot of planning for this trip, that was my wife's passion to do, but this first day was fantastic. It was my first time and my son's first time. We are celebrating 2nd birthday this week and had the best day today. So many characters were walking the street and they go  out of their way to say hi to the little ones.",
          "I love Disney!  I grew up going as a kid, and nothing better than the first time I brought my daughter when she was almost 4, to see it through your child's eyes is nothing short of amazing!  I do find it to be a little over the top in \u2026",
          "I used to love Disneyland but so much has changed. I still like some things about it. Tip: Don't go on New Year's Eve unless you're crazy! \ud83d\ude1c",
          "Great night. 1st time at a after dark event. No lines, great music, great costumes. Will be back on these types of events. Price for things, parking included to expensive",
          "We had a great time and the park was not super full on a Thursday in mid-January. We bought the max pass and didn't regret it (you get all the photos too) but most rides were less than a 30 minute wait without the fast pass.\nRISE OF THE \u2026",
          "A great day, but parking was a bit of an issue. We paid to be in the Mickey & Friends parking lot and they told us it might be full of might have to go to the exit and park in the other lot. Which is okay except we had to go all the way up \u2026",
          "It's such a great place. The amount of detail and effort they put into their rides and performances is astonishing. Came when I was 10 and loved it. Came again at 22 and was not disappointed. My wife's favorite place to visit!",
          "My family and I went to celebrate a close family friend birthday for the day at Disneyland and Disney California Adventures... It was a perfect day to spend a day when it wasn't that crowded and busy... We were able to ride at least 7 total rides between the 2 parks...",
          "Great park so many old school rides that are still there from when it first opened. Very easy to get both parks done entirely in 2 days. We only did 1 day but managed to get all the rides we wanted to do covered. The old school fast pass system is awesome and it is worth the extra $10 to do it through the app.",
          "It's what you expect from Disney; fun, music,  good memories. Get there early in the day to avoid some lines. I've been as a tourist and an annual pass holder and I can say pay monthly passes are why I took off 1 star. People who cannot \u2026",
          "I've grown up coming to Disneyland and have never had a bad experience. Attention to detail is world class,  and it's fun for kids & the kid in all of us. Will be coming back for years to come.",
          "I cruise around this area for Lyft picking people up and dropping them off. For me it's a place where I can make money. Most of the people you see around here seem to be having some kind of a good time so that's the important thing.",
          "BEAUTIFUL. Beautiful scenery, with all their Lucius plants around, friendly staff, good breakfast, good amenities to keep the kids busy, like playground for my youngest, pool, with also hot tub and kiddie pool, \ud83c\udfc0 basketball and \ud83c\udfd0 \u2026",
          "I was here for the very first time on 1/16 and it was such a magical experience LOL. I'm from the east coast and had only ever been to Disney world and I can say that Disneyland was more memorable for me. The rides were great, food was \u2026",
          "If you can manage to stay at the resort, do it. The benefits are worth the extra money. Magic hour, direct access to Disneyland and great staff.",
          "First time during the Christmas time was a wonder experience. Would recommend to go in the morning how it\u2019s a bit less crowded",
          "Absolutely over packed. Has an incredible influx of customers, yet nothing has gotten better to accommodate it. Half of the time major walk ways are blocked off for parades.",
          "It was fun. Can't get everything done in 1 or 2 days or even 3. The works were really helpful. Don't forget to explore the areas in the between the parks too.",
          "Happiest place on earth!! I have to come here every few years. When I was younger, it seemed there was no avoiding hour+ lines and that it was just part of the trip that I had to accept. The last two times I\u2019ve visited we used the MaxPass \u2026",
          "We stayed at Paradise Pier.\nIt was nice. Several of the employees were nice. I don't remember their names as they were being nice to everyone but me. \n\nIt was good to see people being LeKind.",
          "Disney always gets it right. Outstanding staff that go out of their way to be helpful, good for all ages, super entertaining, and clean",
          "Had an amazing time, its definitely an experience! Make sure you go at night, especially to California Adventures, it's like the difference between night and day in Vegas. The crowds were pretty intense but if you get a max pass, you can \u2026",
          "Many rides and a lot of meet up with your favourite characters of Disney...a variety of fun and drinks also available. A fun trip for whole family",
          "Its Disney the happiest place in the world. I had only been to Disney World so my expectations were low for Disneyland but it was amazing. They have great rides and staff. Would love to go back to Disneyland before World.",
          "Too many people and the ride line takes forever. You're lucky to go on 6 rides within 12 hours.",
          "Rise of the Resistence is worth arriving at 7am for, just to be sure you're through the gate before 9am. Disneyland in general has a lot of ambition that it completely lives up to. Wonderful time.",
          "Lots of great rides for kids, even more waiting time though. With planning and fast pass we were able to do 12 rides in 8 hours, after which we had to go back.",
          "It's like being in a Star wars movie. Truly a theme park.  Fun for all ages. Walt Disney would be proud",
          "Many of the lands and rides have been updated and this makes a return visit well worth it. The classics are still there, too. Went with my 2 year old grandson so I did not explore Star Wars too much but it looked cool so I will definitely return to explore that!",
          "Always  good it never dissapoints! Is upto the family or individuals how they want to spend their day.  If you want to do rides you must get a fast pass the time you save is so worth it... plus it makes the experience  so much better.",
          "I'd like to give Disneyland five stars, but let's face it, you practically have to be a millionaire to take a family of four there. It cost my family over $700 for three days. Food is outrageously expensive and in most cases only mediocre \u2026",
          "The weather was great, mid-to-high 60's. The park was wasn't overly crowded, at least until mid-afternoon. In the morning I walked on the Star Tours ride back-to-back, in a short period of time. The attention to detail in Galaxy's Edge was \u2026",
          "I absolutely loved everything except the part when your kids need to use the bathroom and the lines are just astronomically long. Once your in line for so long, it can be very difficult to get your spot back in line.  I noticed they had \u2026",
          "We decided to go to Disneyland today and was not disappointed. The new Star Wars land was amazing. It's like walking into the all the films we have all seen. In the daylight, it's really cool but at night when the area it all lit it's \u2026",
          "One day was not enough. Couldn't visit all of it. Every single moment was great there with family members \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Always a great time. It was raining while we were there so the lines were minimal, it took us under 10 minutes to get onto the rides, usually just walking straight onto the ride. Starwars was amazing! I was completely impressed with the attention to detail.",
          "I would go here just for galaxies edge alone. Amazing rides and very immersive. 5 stars easily.",
          "It's well known for long waits, and they sometimes make decisions that feel like the customer is not a prime consideration, but the place is a ton of fun, and they do typically take great care of you if anything goes wrong.  Just be polite to staff and you'll do well.",
          "Rise of the Resistance  was out of this world . Love it when people are super friendly with each other.  And I love that we can bring in our own food. Strollers shouldn't be allowed in the park ha jk",
          "It really is a magical place. So much to see and do. But unfortunately, so little time to truly enjoy it all because of how crowded it gets. Highly recommend the purchase of MaxPass with your admission to maximize your visit. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is literally out of this world.",
          "It\u2019s the happiest place on earth, who doesn\u2019t have a great time At Disney. Being there for the 60th anniversary was pretty rough. They are getting better at utilizing technology as well.",
          "Unfortunately for my daughter we did not experience the Disney magic. Staff we encountered did not really want to be their and did not uphold the mission and values of Disney. Happiest place on earth it was not. Crappiest place on earth would also be unfair. Not something my family and I will remember for being a great memory.",
          "The park was great! Apart from some attractions that we're under construction or renovation the rest of the theme park was great fun!",
          "Amazing (military/DOD only) facility. Centrally located to most attractions, the track at Fontana is an hour or so away, and exceptionally maintained.",
          "They make a tremendous effort to minimize wait times, trams, parking, and even food service. Their staff is always so helpful and friendly.  The park is kept incredibly clean, considering the amount of people and trash that must be consumed each day. I am always genuinely impressed.",
          "DISNEYLINE. Yeah the kids love it. But you will be significantly poorer ($580 for a family of four) for the privilege of standing in lines for four or five hours and riding five or six rides. Disneyland has the lowest fun:expense ratio of \u2026",
          "So much fun! COVID-19 Has the Resort closed right now.",
          "I love Disneyland. There is so many fun rides and shows to enjoy. I can't wait until next year when I can visit again.",
          "Why am i waiting 2 hours in line to give you $500? Also, they give discounts to Active Duty and retired but not Honorably discharged Veterans? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0fCome on Disney...",
          "Met 13 uncle's aunt's cousins for FAMILY REUNION.. SO NEAT @ Christmas... The rides are all dressed up... The castle is decorated and a huge tree on main Street! The DISNEY SNOW was a delightful surprise!",
          "I haven't been here since '03 and it has changed. If you're going to go, definitely come during holiday/seasonal times. The themes were nothing short of breath taking. The food was amazing and the staff have been very helpful and the cast members were so sweet and had a blast with them.",
          "Everything and everyone was awesome... except for this one tram operator for some unknown reason separated my family even though we had plenty of room to keep us together.  We asked several times what was going on he insisted to move them. \u2026",
          "This really is the happiest place on earth first of 2 days and the boys are having a great time the lines are long but the rides are totally worth the wait...the employees have been so helpful and friendly... please bring your kids it is \u2026",
          "We love Disneyland! We had a great experience this time around. We used the max pass and rode every ride we wanted to. I love that includes pictures too. There are plenty of options for every age, delicious food and treats and great customer service. We will visit again, and again!",
          "The staff was wonderful, the service was great. The food was good and convenient. Our room was clean and comfortable.. And last but not least the location was perfect. Close to everything Disney.",
          "There for the Lunar New Year fest. The food was delicious. Disneyland is always a fun place to be. Fun rides and tasty food.",
          "The crowds on Dec 8 were manageable.  Longest line we waited in was approx 45 minutes.   Space Mountain did have a wait time of 140 minutes but we used fast passes for that ride.  Park opened at 8 A.M. and closed at Midnight.",
          "I love the new Star Wars section! They put so much detail into everything there! Most impressive.",
          "A very grand and awesome experience. I like this park very much. The rides, shows, architectures are very good.\nAlthough most of attractions are children based, it is suitable for people of all ages and if you are coming in groups, you will \u2026",
          "Fun place, but many of the prices are super high. Lots of the toddler meals have almost nothing to them and cost around 7 bucks! Disney is so good at controlling crowds with lines, you'd think someone would grab a clue and do a better job \u2026",
          "Its Disneyland... Enough said. Just bring a limitless credit card and a lot of patience to wait in all the lines you will encounter. You Can't be afraid of crowds either because you can not find a quiet place anywhere if you need it. \u2026",
          "Aside from prices for things in the park (which I was expecting) Disneyland is a great park. I'll admit that I prefer Disneyworld more, but Disneyland was very nice. The lines were short and efficient (unlike Universal Studios). Fast pass \u2026",
          "Thank you for helping us celebrate. We just got married and this was so much fun!",
          "For the cost of Disneyland tickets, you would think that they would have more contingency plans in place in case of inclement weather. Shops became crowded as guests sought shelter from heavy rains and many of the shows were cancelled due \u2026",
          "Great and magical place its a bit pricey but the advantage is that includes all day access and park hop (switch from one park to another) for as long as you stay there take your time and enjoy every little thing that the resort has to offer its worth your time",
          "Always have a lot of fun there. Great place to catch your breath and get away.",
          "Oh my gosh! So much fun! Disney knows how to make people happy. Greatest customer service ever!",
          "Loved this place! Disneyland is always a great experience! Yeah it can get pricey but the smile it brings on the kids faces is priceless. We always look forward to our return!",
          "This truly is my \"Happiest place on Earth\". Amazing energy, magical experiences and great vegan food and drink!",
          "A very amazing place, so many creative minds have come together to make this place possible.  A saturday in Dec 2019, packed like sardines. If you could arrange a week day trip, instead of a weekend trip, it will be well worth it.",
          "Perfect is the most valuable word I can ever imagine for this place. I suggest coming early in the morning, but not stand in line too early for the millennium falcon. Que was around 145 minutes and at 11.00 was around 90 minutes or less",
          "Received text room ready at 3. Arrived 4:30.  No bags in room.  Telephone receiver in room didn't work.  Still doesn't after notifying 3 different departments.  Bags told be in room 25 min. I said we will just stop by now and get them. \u2026",
          "5 stars because it's definitely the happiest place on earth. Don't you just love waiting in those lines after spending $10,000 dollars getting your family into the park? You know I do! I just really love the concept of standing, it's really \u2026",
          "How can you ever have a bad day at Disneyland? The magic is still there. The cast members at Disneyland are the best! They make your experience a pleasure from the time you arrive at the parking lot until you drive away at the end of the \u2026",
          "The whole experience is truly unique and a blast for all ages. Even my 1 year old was giggling on rides and smiling at the characters walking around. The attention to detail at the various themed areas is fantastic, especially when it comes \u2026",
          "A memorable 2 day trip at the amusement park with the kids. The parade and the fireworks bring back the nostalgic memories of your own childhood and one to remember for even a lifetime. Hope to visit again very soon",
          "Only complaint so far is the pool closes way to early. Would be nice to go back to hotel and use the pool/hot tub after a long day at the park. The slides dont need to be open, just the pool and/or hot tub. \nEvery staff member was very \u2026",
          "A great time overall.\n\n Be warned LINES exist! \nIf you are above them DON'T GO HERE! The lovely cast members at City Hall are not responsible for your entitled tantrum \ud83d\ude09 leave your inner Veruca Salt at home",
          "Disneyland is always fun to go to. I would highly recommend getting the max pass. It as so much better without having to wait in the long lines.",
          "Love Disneyland, every time I have been there. But Crowd sizes seem to be getting even more crazy (yes I know that is going to happen) but when you can barely walk through the shops, the rides have 300 min wait times you have to ask whether or not they should have called \"capacity\" a few hours ago?",
          "Happy birthday to me.  1st time going on my birthday.  It was so much fun!!!",
          "Don't let the parking prices discourage you. Parking is generally expensive for most places. Eat and drink. Treat yourself and your loved ones too.",
          "An amusement parks and resort, Disneyland Resort, otherwise known as Disneyland is owned byThe Walt Disney Company located in Anaheim, California. A huge entertainment resort which has two theme parks namely Disneyland Park and Disney \u2026",
          "Disneyland is a wonderful place to visit for people of all ages. The park has a magical way transporting characters we know and love into our world.",
          "Always the Happiest On Earth! The characters and staff super friendly. Lines moved super fast,and as always,this place is clean,and tidy. You can always find employees ready and available to assist with any questions. Very impressed on how FRIENDLY all guests were. Will definitely return soon.",
          "We planned a family vacation for 4. Disneyland seemed like a good idea. Yes, we could have paid less if we stayed outside of the resort, or drove in from Carlsbad for the day, ate food in the parking lot from a packed cooler, but we wanted \u2026",
          "Disneyland will always be a great place to visit. Go there now while the crowds are still reasonable since the opening of Star Wars Galaxy. It's only a matter of time before the open some new attraction that sends lines around the block.",
          "What can I say? Happiest place on earth. As an Annual Pass Holder, this place is literally my second home.",
          "When you stay at the Disneyland Resort you feel like you are still associated with the Parks.  People are friendly and helpful.  As what appears to be the Disney way they seem to make improvements large and small every year.",
          "Every time we go here we have nothing but the best time. All the cast members, even if they're not having a great day, provides the top notch customer service everyone looks for.",
          "Long walks. But I love Disney land\nSmall kids should not go. Kids 7 and older should go so they can remember it",
          "Okay Disneyland you need to come up with a better fast pass schedule to accommodate parade times and add the main rides to the pass ie: pirates and mansion. Also more time to take pictures with characters would be outstanding.",
          "Truly the happiest place on earth. I go to So Cal on a regular basis and I go to downtown Disney to get Beignets and gumbo from the Jazz Kitchen and a mug from the home decor store almost every time I'm there. Highly recommended escape from the real world.",
          "Rise of the Resistance is the name, and getting in a boarding group is the game. Well, you came to the right place. Here's some tips that helped me get in boarding group 20:\n\n-Get lined up at the park doors at an hour before opening\n-Use \u2026",
          "lots of walking,long lines. Even with a fast pass you might be able to use it 4-6 times in a day. lots of really old rides. with the money Disney has they really should do some updating. if you can get past the long lines they do have some neat rides for children.",
          "Great place to spend the day. Highly recommend max pass. Villain time in the fall is the best time to go. Not quite sure why Hook and the Queen of Hearts need to wear the big masks though. Would love to hear what they have to say.",
          "Amazing during Halloween. I loved all the decisions and everything Halloweeny they had done. \nThe Max Pass is where it's at and definitely worth the money. All the fast passes and the photo pass were well worth it. I highly recommend it to have a better experience here at the park.",
          "New Star Wars land is incredible!  -1 star for charging extra to do fast passes from the app. Not cool.",
          "I felt like an absolute princess walking into this place. I definitely got very excited seeing the nostalgic wood mansion with lovely Christmas decorations. I love that in the lobby, there is a fireplace and a piano. I definitely enjoyed \u2026",
          "If you are taller than four feet expect little leg room on the rides, Park tickets, food and souvenirs are very expensive. There \"discount tickets\" are made for locals not for vacationers in that an annual pass is worth the price if you are \u2026",
          "One of our absolute favorite places!!! This was our first time going around Christmas time and while the crowds are large and crazy the decorations are amazing!! We love it here anytime of year!",
          "It's Disneyland! Of course I love it! Been going since I was a child and still love it. Yes, the lines are long and it's expensive, but you will have a great time. Go play and find the kid in you!",
          "Smugglers run is the best ride ever created (video game + ride?!) And Galaxy's Edge is super well done in general. Rest of the park is still as I remember it all those years ago and it's refreshing.",
          "Fantastic resort for children. Really well done and thought out.  Loses a star for terrible food options. No where to eat anything nice. Eat here for a week and you could get a heart attack.",
          "I love this place! Most amazing stay! Staff is always so caring!",
          "All the artificial stuff....  Kids love it.  Adults tags along just to make the kids happy.  Expensive.  Long lines.  Nature is much better than this.",

          "literally the best place on Earth. The atmosphere is so fun the kids have a blast, there's so much fun rides the people are in a great mood, and its very very clean, that's one of my favorite things about it.  all the characters and people \u2026",
          "Had a great time at California adventure. Stay for the light show. Definitely worth it",
          "It is obviously great for families with children. Kids love it and they have a blast going on all of the fun rides and experiencing all of the fun things that Disneyland has to offer. One important warning for families on a tight budget, \u2026",
          "I Feel like a kid again. Watching your grandkids experience it for first time is nothing short of amazing",
          "Its Disneyland what can I say. It's amazing! I can try to explain it. To me once I cross the street and start walking to the main gate I get goose bumps. I smell the scent of the park. I see the smiles of other people and the cast members. \u2026",
          "If I could dance the dance of the mouse I would, but my poor feet could not keep up with his erratic rhythm, twisting and turning. And he kept going and going and going. I stopped but he kept twisting and turning. I gave up. I could not catch the mouse.",

          "I could have stayed at the Lego store all day.  I love legos so does my son.  This was like a candy store for Lego fans.",
          "Great theme park for the kids and adults. Very busy but the fastlane app works great to skip the lines. I just think that 804$ for 1 day hopper pass plus max pass for family with 2 children is a lot of money. We only had 1 day to go there. There are better deals if you visit 2 days",
          "First time here, guest services was attentive room has some special touches I have not seen! Great experience!",
          "Disneyland 20 years ago was an easy 5 star. Unfortunately, they have extracted every bit of value from the place with outrageous price increases, and the experience is abysmal most days as they try their hardest to cram as many sardines in \u2026",
          "This place is the best during the Christmas season!! I buy my annual pass just for this season! It's like walking into another world!! Thanks Disney for always making my visit a MAGICAL experience!!\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

          "No matter how hard one tries hard to be as polite some people are just rude (employees also). Disneyland used to be more affordable but it has gotten so expensive and this saddens me.. I",
          "Had a great day with my family. Rode lots of great rides, had good food and watched an amazing nighttime show. Would love to go back. One day wasn't quite enough for both parks.",
          "In general terms, I always look forward to a family vacation at Disneyland. Yes, there are crowds and lines. Yes, rides break down. Yes, food is overpriced. All that being said, time just passes by while there. Employees are exceptionally \u2026",
          "I had so much fun! We ate at Downtown Disney at Jazz Kitchen too.",
          "Had a great time with the family. The cast was happy and helpful as they always are. It costs a lot to go to Disneyland but you can tell they put a lot of time and money in making that place amazing!! The kids are in a dreamland and the adults can enjoy feeling like a kid again. We go every year and it feels different every time.",
          "Disneyland has always been fun but today was my first day in Star Wars land. I was not disappointed the way it was set up and created very nice, only wish there were more rides. The park was pretty crowded today but we were able to go on \u2026",
          "Star Wars Galaxy's Edge was amazing!. Savi's workshop experience was fun, but pricy! Make reservations before you go, at least a week out. Didn't get to ride Rise of the Resistance because of the dumb queue system. All boardings groups were full for the entire day within 15 minutes of the park being open.",
          "Best. Place. Ever. Kids or adults, sure its spendy but worth every penny we spent. Stayed open to close 4 days in a row! Wouldn't dare be there on the weekends but mid week was perfect!",
          "My Grand children, my wife and I had a wonderful time. The kids are ages 6 & 8, and were beside themselves as they didn't know that we were going to Disneyland. Big surprise.",
          "Cool place. But it could use a little something. A new section to the park, similar to California Adventure. We need Polnareff Land. It could bring \u00d72 the people and produce \u00d74 the profit. Plus, it'll be a jojo reference, which is also a plus.",
          "They always do an amazing job of keeping the parks clean. The rides are fun and I love Galaxy's edge. However, I hate how expensive the tickets are now and you still have to pay for parking even if you're an annual pass holder.",
          "The park grounds are always really well kept, and they definitely go above and beyond to try to make you forget that you're in the middle of Anaheim, CA when you're in the park.  I was very impressed by the new Star Wars decor.  You definitely feel like you're stepping into a different world while you're there.",
          "Amazing theme park full of fun for the whole family. If you get fast pass - plan it out wisely what you will use them on. Pick the rides you want to go on the most. Typically you will skip about 1 hour to 1.5 hours of waiting in line. The \u2026",
          "It\u2019s Disneyland how can you give it any less! Depending on your group you are with there are so many options of what to do and where to go! Utilize everything fast passes! The new app system is great down load the app before you go! You can \u2026",
          "It was a wonderful but long day!  Saw and did so much but so much more to see.  The Star Wars exhibit was exceptional.  Saw Chewbacca, Storm Troopers and Princess Leia!  So much fun!",
          "The fast pass system here is great it basically gives you unlimited fast passes when you pay for the Max Pass. Using features in the park such as signing up for fast passes, ordering food, and finding your way around the park is centered \u2026",
          "The ability to make a grown man feel like a kid again is the magic of this park. The originality of this park is awesome. It has that that magical feeling as soon as you enter. I highly recommend coming to this location.",
          "Great place to spend the day!",
          "Loved the experience.  Such a great time I had with my family.",
          "Other theme parks might have more thrilling rides, but they don't have the atmosphere that Disney gets you. The churros, turkey legs, and cream cheese pretzels are to die for. The max pass has served me well every time I have gotten it, \u2026",
          "Black spire is incredible! Total immersion into the Starwars universe. The light saber build is a goose bump inducing experience. So worth the cost and difficulty of getting an appointment if you are a fan. I personally can't wait to go to the new ride coming soon. Long live the resistance!!!!!",
          "Disneyland is amazing. I've been going since I was a little kid and it still invokes the same emotions and excitement. It's gotten pretty expensive, but it is worth the price if you're willing to devote the whole day.",
          "We spent three days here and absolutely loved it. There was a lot of walking, but there were also a lot of great memories that our little ladies will have for a lifetime. They loved meeting all the princesses and the Mickey Mouse \u2026",
          "Great time, too bad \"Small world\" was closed so it could be 'winterized' for the holidays. Kids would've liked it. Galaxy's edge was cool, waiting for new attraction to open.",
          "A magical place for anyone and everyone, for all age groups. Everyone will love the ambience and the surrounding. Souvenirs are exorbitant. Waiting time for the rides varies from minimum 25min to 70minutes. Be ready to walk miles. Check \u2026",
          "I went there in December with my family and honestly it\u2019s so much fun there\u2019s no way you could be sad there except maybe when the ride closes or shuts down but it\u2019s so fun the rides the food the snacks the parades the transportation the people you should just go there.",
          "Disneyland is simply amazing. The entire park, as well as California Adventure are full of great rides, delicious food and extremely helpful cast members. This park easily lives up to the reputation it has built up throughout the years. \u2026",
          "I love this place! I'm a kid at heart when I go, and I try to go every couple of years. Yes, it's expensive, but you should try to go at least once in your life! I loved the new Galaxy's Edge and how they tied Star Tours in with it, even \u2026",
          "How do you review Disneyland? It is a truly amazing place. I first visited about 5 years ago and have been lucky enough to come back between 20-30 times since then, and I still find something new and magical every single time. Disneyland \u2026",
          "I love going to Disneyland this place has amazing rides and so many Disney characters to take pictures with and it's absolutely without a doubt THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH",
          "Disneyland is nice place to visit. I don't usually eat corndogs but I do at Disneyland and they are amazing. Great spot for people watching and just chilling taking in the atmosphere. Big Thunder and Splash mountain are pretty fun but the \u2026",
          "I'm a total Disnerd, so I may be a bit biased... But I love this place! Even high capacity days are enjoyable, and there's nothing quite like seeing the parks dressed up for the holidays! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "This park is so much fun...the attractions are amazing and you do feel like a kid again. We went during prime time ( Halloween) and even though crowded,  very organized park. Everything flows. Employees are very pleasant !",
          "Good time. New star wars ride broke. Twice. Otherwise, park was great and staff was super friendly all the time",
          "Everyone needs to go at least once in their lives. After waiting years to finally go I can say it was even more than I was expecting! Everything was absolutely perfect",
          "It is very apparent that Disney has been putting alot of effort into efficiency lately. While vegan meal options would have made the experience much better (leaving the park hungry isn't the best feeling), you can tell they are stepping up their game.",
          "A must see for every child 8 and under. After that, California Adventure. So much of Disney is visual, from parades, characters, plays, lights to virtual reality. Ride the rides during the day, go back to hotel to recharge from 2-5pm and then come back to catch the amazing nightlife.",
          "Best place on earth.  Very expensive though.  Makes it hard to afford for a large family.  I don't see why they charge so much when they make millions every day.  \ud83d\ude25",
          "Great place, but nothing is cheap. But what can you do when you have kids. They loved it",
          "Such a magical place to attend with family. Be prepared for line ups and business and expensive purchases. But knowing all that in advance can make it so your trip is amazing. Just enjoy the excitement and fun and be in no rush",
          "Pricey and very over full and they say they cater to all but if you smoke they don't they make you leave to have a cigarette which is not catering to all most people would just like one place in the park to go food has become outrageously \u2026",
          "You\u2019ll have to read my previous review for Disneyland Park. Everything is the same I can\u2019t think of one single tiny thing wrong to say about this place. Indeed the happiest place on earth.",
          "How can Disneyland not bring out the childhood magic and spirit in everyone. Worlds of fantasy all in one place. Staff that embodies the utmost in kindness, courtesy, and customer service. Utilizing the latest technology to bring realism \u2026",
          "Took our 3 year old for 1 day while in town and she LOVED it. Perfect for our first visit with the little one and went during the week day for the discount \ud83d\ude09",
          "I felt that they really want to make sure you have an enjoyable experience and make everything as easy as possible.",
          "Magical place. I'm really impressed by how the characters interacted with my daughter and she had a splendid experience there. The place is neat and clean and staffs are friendly.  Gifts and souvenirs shops are overloaded with surprises.  I spent quite a fortune on my own family gifts too..absolutely fabulous.",
          "Went at noon just because we wanted to see the fire works. This was a dream come true. If you stay to see the fireworks, make sure you take a towel to sit on. It gets pretty crowded. We did the rapid rise pass and we rode like 11 rides in 9 hours.",
          "I always enjoy coming to disneyland! Love every ride! The new rise of the resistance ride was amazing!",
          "Lines were long as expected for some rides but overall not bad, love the single rider lines, some food items were reasonable and the shows are amazing. Can't come here often but definitely worth the trip once in a while",
          "Rise of the resistance has to be 1 of the best rides in the park. We were boarding group 69 dude! Lol",
          "I always love this place.  If you're here for a special occasion the max pass for photos is pretty great.",
          "During this month (February) lots of rides are being refurbished. But we still had fun! And we are exhausted after 12 hours of walking!",
          "My wife would live here if she could!!! I love the view from the monorail station by the submarine ride and who could pass up the $5 churros \ud83d\ude02",
          "The extra $45 per ticket for the fast pass and photo pass is totally worth it. Max pass is great. The Disney app is free and let's you check wait times for rides, order and pay for food and drinks online and has navigation so you can see \u2026",
          "Still magical! Max pass is the only way to go - worth every penny",
          "Disneyland has never failed to put me in the holiday mood, no matter how big a \"Grinch\" I might be. We went with our kids as they were growing up and I am still going with my oldest daughter 35 years later. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Decorated in Disney style, down to the faucet handles and carpet. Great service, pools and restaurants. Next to Downtown Disney. Short walk to the parks. Valet parking. Plenty of amenities nearby. Very safe.",
          "Have stayed there every time I have been to Disneyland since I was a kid. Now it's traditional to stay there with my kids. Love it! Super clean, very comfortable and great friendly atmosphere.",
          "This was my first time ever going to Disneyland. I had researched a little before going but not a ton. There are lots of fun rides to go on and surprisingly a lot for our 20 month old son. It's a little crowded, but it really is a well oiled machine. Everyone working here was so friendly and helpful. We can't wait to go back!",
          "really fun, tried the new star wars ride, rise of the resistance, wasn't my favorite but still good. the ride seems to break down every so often and you will need a boarding pass to ride it.",
          "I have been here for about 5 times already and I love this place.They have amazing rides and great food.I would recommend this place for family vacations !",
          "Christmastime is always great. Decorations.music.lights and fireworks!\nA lot of people. Don't go until after the 6th of January if you want to ride a lot. Lines are 2 hours.",
          "I am having a great time. My room was ready on my checking in. The room was clean and spacious. Staff is amazing!!! I am on day 2!!!!",
          "Fun and fantastic.  Once past security.  Fun begins.  Tram ride wait, short.  Entry was quick.  There is the normal foot congestion.    Disney staff give a warm, welcoming feeling",
          "They call it the happiest place on Earth for good reason! I am fortunate enough to live in southern California and have this wonderful place so close by! I've been going since I was a child and have never stopped loving it! It really is a must visit kind of place.",
          "This place to me was that it is older than say Disney World FL. Or Great America and the place in OH where snoopy is the main charter.\nSorry Disney resort even in off season your priced out of this world. Better luck with your next customer.",
          "I'm afraid the \"Happiest Place in the World\" is the most frustrating. Way too many people result in a negative experience when weighted against the very expensive cost of admission and food. We stayed on site and bought the max pass and it was still little bang for the amount of money spent...",
          "Had an amazing day with the family at Disney, wish I would have paid attention to the hours as there was am event going which closed a park early. All in all. Great place and will definitely return.",
          "Today was an awesome, AWESOME day. Spent a chunk of the day at Galaxy's Edge, then wandered through Tomorrowland for a bit.  Great Character interaction.",
          "This place keeps getting better and better! Parking structure is improved, the app is awesome! The way they handle the sheer volume of guests is nothing short of amazing.",
          "I love of ride in Disneyland park. Maxpass is value , you can play more than others. Love it! Water music and Disney shown on water are really special.",
          "Amazing, totally recommend, and the fast pass well worth the money. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing experience and memories",
          "Its showing its age and a few of your favorite rides may not be in service. oh yea you probably wont get to ride the new starwars ride. always breaking and the lottery is a joke.",
          "We had a great night together at sweethearts nite. Everything was really nice though was a little sad that they sold out of the event pins",
          "Over all we enjoyed our selves but surprisingly a few staff members were rude and I mean with attitude. I wouldn't expect from disney. Just saying.",
          "Its Disneyland.  Its a childhood dream land.\n\nBoth parks are amazing. Need atleast 3 days at minimum.\n\nFelt California adventure is more current and current generation kids would like it more.",
          "It's Disney, what more do I say? \n\nWe've only been here once and that was two years ago for my son's 4th birthday. It's huge, beautiful and awesome walking around here. You'll definitely get your steps in, that's for sure! \n\nHonestly if \u2026",
          "Visited the park for a work team building exercise. We went on a business \"behind the magic tour\". I came out with some interesting actionable insights. Very much so in regards to personable experiences \"the magic\". I would recommend the \u2026",
          "Quick little tip: none of the Cast members seem to know what mobile wallet and Google pay are. I asked three different members, they all said it wasn't accepted at the park, and it was accepted everywhere in the park. Cast members need to \u2026",
          "After coming back after two years its still fun to spent time with the family, now that my boys are little older they can enjoy it better.",
          "Loved it! My grandson's 1st time. \nIt was raining. Not any disney characters were there. Did see Chewbacca that was great!",
          "This has been my favorite vacation spot for many years now. The updates will only keep getting better over time! Go ride hyper space mountain 17 times.",
          "Disappointed to make the trip, get there early only to have to tell my kids we can't do the new star wars ride because all the passes are taken by 8:10am. Had fun otherwise.",
          "Every time I go to Disneyland, it\u2019s like I am magically transported to a different world! It\u2019s one of my favorite places, and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a pick-me-up or is forever young at heart! \u2665\ufe0f",
          "Wish the estimated time for rides, reflected the fast pass users. 60 min wait can turn into 90 min or more with the fast pass users.",
          "Its Disneyland, c'mon of course it's great. Get the fast pass to help get in on the busy rides and enjoy the walking....12 miles a day we averaged.",
          "Disney is already amazing. Star Wars Galaxy's Edge is out of this world! Seriously. No pun intended.",
          "I hate how they keep going up on prices! But it\"s true, it is a magical place & kids would love to see their favorite characters come to life. Too bad it costs an arm and a leg!",
          "Had such a wonderful time! It was my first time to the Disneyland Park. It's smaller in scale to DisneyWorld but that was just fine as it was easier to traverse the park. The classic rides I had been on in Florida seemed even a little \u2026",
          "My husband and I had a great experience at Disneyland. The staff was super friendly and overall everything felt magical.",
          "Definitely a must visit if you're in the area. Kids, adults all ages will call this place the happiest place on earth.",
          "The price was worth it! There are so many rides and employees to help. I would say just bring your own lunch to avoid overpaying for food there. But overall such a lovely experience to feel like a kid again.",
          "Always fun on a day that most the lines were 20 minutes or less.\ud83d\ude01",
          "Love the attention to detail in making it a relatively carefree stay. The beds could have been more comfortable at that price point.",
          "Went 02/06, There was a fire at the restaurant we were at in the park so we had to move to another side of the park. Breakfast did not taste good in the restaurant right across from The \"Peter Pan\" Ride. Disneyland is not DisneyWorld.",
          "Although this place is beautiful and I enjoyed the Disney atmosphere there, the park can be quite boring for adults. The park is very crowded, so be prepared for waiting in long lines. Most of the rides are simple animatronics. Other than \u2026",
          "The fantasmic show was incredible.",
          "We took a quick weekend trip and attended Oogie Boogie\u2019s Bash. While I can\u2019t say the Halloween party is worth the extra cost due to the crowd size, I did have fun and got to experience something I\u2019d never done before. Of course, I will be returning in the (hopefully) not so distant future to experience even more!",
          "Disneyland is pricey, but if you go on the right day it is TOTALLY worth it. Haven't been in 20something yrs, but boy did I feel like a kid again. Definitely going back.",
          "Happiest place on earth indeed.  Really just a wonderful place in general.  As a Star Wars geek from way back I found Galaxy's Edge to be wonderfully well done.  Seeing the Millennium Falcon sitting there was cooler than I expected and \u2026",
          "Disney land resort was fun. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Wasn't too crowded and with the max pass getting fast passes was a breeze.  You can be in line and reserve your next fast pass for either park.  Food was all around excellent, the \u2026",
          "One of mine and my families favorite places to come. Go during the week and the crowds are less. Lots of fun memories to be made here just waiting for you to show up",
          "It was fairly enjoyable and quite a trip to take with my family of 7.",
          "Disneyland with my grandson was excellent. I recommend getting a yearly pass if you live nearby.  I have wonderful memories with Grandson Steven at Disneyland and California Adventure.",
          "An amazing experience right in amongst the park! How great to get up and not waste so much time getting ready, taking shuttle, parking etc.",
          "The happiest place on earth. As you can see in my pics. We love going to Disney land and California adventures too.",
          "Truly a magical place it was the first time for my 2 youngest and they loved it. I love the great food and the joy and happiness it brings to my kids. And most of the lines were better than i have experienced in the past at other theme parks.",
          "How is rating Disneyland even a thing?! This place is legitimately the happiest place on Earth!!!  It's amazing",
          "My son is 3yrs old ,this was a awesome first  time visit for him.I think the best thing was seeing  him have a blast and being  there with  family.Thank you for all the fun times!!!",
          "Husband and I enjoyed 2 days here for our honeymoon. I had just had surgery so my husband pushed me everywhere in a wheelchair for those 2 days. I think we did every ride except the little kid ones. The shows were amazing. Fantasmic was \u2026",
          "Happiest place on earth - the new Starwars area is amazingly realistic - may the force and happiness be with you - don\u2019t forget to do the Pirates of the Caribbean tour and Peter Pan",
          "I wish if they change thir room style like the pink Disney hotel in Paris \ud83d\ude0d but this lobby is awesome",
          "It is the best transportation hub in the O.C.!! Literally every bus line from L.A., RIVERSIDE AND San Bernardino; including the Art lines; the Disney blue themed buses/shuttles that help connect the dots to anywhere in Anaheim & southern California destinations!",
          "This place is always magical, the holiday season makes a bit crowded but you have to expect that around this time of year. Disneyland does a great job with emerging you into the Christmas spirit, as soon as you stop into the park the feel, \u2026",
          "Disneyland is always a magical and fun-filled experience this time was no different. Especially with all the fun Halloween decorations around the park. I would highly recommend going!",
          "Always well taken care of. Great place to spend time enjoying your family.",
          "The photo ops with the characters was plentiful.  The cavalcade versus the full blown parades was sweet but not as fulfilling. Missed the stage shows too! Disneyland holds a special place in my family's hearts!!!\nSleeping Beauty's Castle is lovely and vibrant!  It was worth the wait!\nMy precious babies and I made great memories together!",
          "Loves it!! Who wouldn't? All sorts of amazing and fun rides, great rides, great shows. All of my kids had an amazing time and the all access pass let us go get a few adult drinks and ride some giant rides without the kids. We cannot wait to go back. If I could I would buy a season pass. Could easily get your money's worth!!",
          "They say the greatest place on earth.\nIt isn\u2019t for me as it\u2019s not my thing, but evidence of it being the greatest place on earth is all over the park. \nI saw a little boy get off the Peter Pan ride and his eyes were like saucers and he turned the lady letting them off the ride, and with eyes wide open he\u2019s says. Thanks so very much",
          "I love Disneyland and California adventure. Both parks have amazing rides, foods, and shows to watch. Having been an annual pass holder for a few years now I am proud to call myself a Disney fan. There\u2019s so much to love here and even though I\u2019ve been coming often for years, there\u2019s always more to do and see.",
          "This truly is a magical place for little ones.  We had the best time ever here.",
          "I have loved Disney for as long as I can remember. And coming here was a dream that came true. It really is the greatest place on earth and if I ever get a change to come back I most certainly will!!! \ud83c\udf89",
          "This place isn't terrible, it's just not for me. It's incredibly expensive, it's very crowded, and it's just a lot of trouble for a good time. I love disney, and I enjoyed it when I was a kid, but it's just too overcrowded for my taste. \u2026",
          "Truly the happiest on earth. Friendly staff, super clean park. It is very clear everyone is trying their best at their jobs here. Everything is incredible. Worth every penny!!",
          "Dont know why my girlfriend at the time bought me $40 worth of souvenirs but I had more fun with my group than her",
          "Disney was amazing! A lot of fun rides, lots of happy kids and later in the day lots of sleeping kids :)\nFood is overpriced and just ok. Many of the bathroom are messy. I understand it's hard to keep up with all the people, but some of the women's restrooms really! needed more attention.",
          "It is cool but crowded. The rides were made for five year olds. Wouldn't recommend going more than once.",
          "I mean. What can I really say?!?! Disneyland is Disneyland. One of the greatest places to visit on earth. There\u2019s literally something here for everyone of every age. It\u2019s always a great time when my family and I visit. Although we could \u2026",
          "Disney is Disney, and it's still better than other parks, but they don't have it together nearly as much as Disney world does. The crew doesn't seem as well trained, and the handicap access is not as streamlined. We've been bounced from cast member to cast member in some cases unsure what we were supposed to do",
          "Star Galaxy Edge is great fun for the whole family. Its just very pack and lines for attractions are long.",
          "Great place to spend time with family! Everyone's peaceful great service everywhere you go. A churro and a turkey leg is a must!!",
          "First time at disney. Both parks were amazing and the weather was perfect. Loved the cars ride amongst others",
          "I'm don't love it this Park have a lot diversified entertainment beautiful for enjoy with the whole family personally recommended this place",
          "Every visit is a new experience. Thought the new star wars area was cool to look at but it has only 2 attractions.",
          "My son proposed to his girlfriend on 10 1.  The park was so good to them.  They were just happy beyond anything.  The castle is a real magic place.  We had two of the happiest days .  Both parks are remarkable",
          "Come see the original playground of Walt Disney! I've been to Disneyland Resort three times and I have to say, it's hard to beat their annual trick-or-treating party on Halloween. You should definitely consider coming on October 31st if \u2026",
          "I\u2019m a grown adult that thought I wasn\u2019t missing out on anything special and I was unwilling to spend $150 on a ticket to a kids resort.\nBut then I took my 4 yr old twins and I was so astonished with the attention to details. Yes the rides \u2026",
          "AWSOME!!! The new star wars ride is the best. You get to fly and control the Falcon, and best part is that you don't need 3D glasses, you can see it in 3D without glasses. Isn't that awsome, you will feel like in the movies and fly like Han Solo.",
          "Best time ever, rooms are great and clean. Will definitely go again\ud83d\ude0d",
          "It was surprisingly organized. Now, I dont have kids and would go to a theme park with kids. So I didnt have to worry about stroller parking and family fun. I could imagine that's a whole different experience.  The new ride Rise of the Resistance was AMAZING. Just might get me a season pass to go more often.",
          "Disneyland just never disappoints.  It has it all, for young or old.  For us the princesses were a real focal point of our trip.  We did the princess breakfast, and we highly recommend, the one on one time with the princesses was something \u2026",
          "This is a good amusement park for child",
          "Great experience, one of my favorite performances are the  gospel choirs.  Excellent choice.",
          "I was really impressed with how the characters interacted with us and with my 3 year old granddaughter. They have definitely improved over the last 15 years. Loved the Oogie Boogie Halloween Celebration! Great job in making my one vacation memorable and enjoyable. I love Disney!!",
          "Freaken disneyland my dude! Happiest place on earth. What more can i say? Food is unique. The experiences are one of a kind. Attention to detail is a massive effort and the staff truly feel like they care for your experience!",
          "Always amazing! Clean and we'll organized, staff is always friendly and attentive.",
          "Enjoyed the food and wine festival. Lots of good food and drinks will recomend to everyone",
          "Very fun and lots of great things. As a frequent Disney World person it was fun to see the other parks on the other coast! Not comparing them made it easier to just enjoy what was there.",
          "Went to California Adventure. Love Flying over California,  The Incredibles roller coaster, Big Bear Rapids and the Cars ride.",
          "Handicapped access is hit or miss.  Rented a mobility scooter which you can't take into rides.  So they make you get into a wheelchair then into ride then into wheelchair then back to scooter.  Anyone who knows mobility issues knows 5 transfers per ride might as well not go as a person with limited mobility",
          "I love Disneyland. Make sure if you are renting a stroller it's only right outside of the park.",
          "Still great! Hadn't been there since childhood and still a. Fun place to come and spend a few days. More clear signs inside the park would be really nice for those of us who dont visit often. Love all the characters and all the old rides especially.",
          "Loved it,its amazing this is the place where I have grown up it's like my second home",
          "Always a blast!  Family loves to come here several times a year.   Cast is normally always polite and courteous.  Rides are kept up and lines kept down.  Park is always spotless.",

          "Best place ive ever been to went in summer so lines were long. But fastpass service is amazing i recommend going at least 3 days. I was wondering before going. If 1 day would be enough but u need at least 3 overall it was great experience. \u2026",

          "Always a good time, especially as an adult with no kids believe it or not. Bring friends and enjoy a cocktail together at the Carthay Lounge, or grab a beer from one of many stands at California Adventures and enjoy the architecture/decor \u2026",
          "Pretty amazing.   Rather crowded,  and kinda expensive.   But we saw some amazing sights, and some fun times.    Star Wars area was pretty interesting.   It is amazing what they have put together over the years.   Always changing.",

          "Great time. They did a really great job decorating for the Boogie boogie Halloween Bash!!! The Villians we're amazing and great at playing their characters. The Guardians of the Galaxy ride was incredibly scary but fun.",
          "Always like it when I can see fireworks from the window.  Too bad the phone\u2019s camera doesn\u2019t do them justice, because Disney does some great fireworks! I just wish we had been on a higher floor or on the other side where they could see them directly from their rooms. They weren\u2019t too loud and booming, either, which was good.",
          "What can one say about Disneyland, I believe Mary Poppins said it best.  It's practically perfect in every single way.",

          "They keep changing this place and it gets confusing. Check out blogs or blogs especially official Disneyland Resort events. Those will help the most if you are planning your visit or looking for hidden treasures within or outside of the park!",
          "It truly is the happiest place on earth.\nMy parents & I have gone there since I was a kid & it was always a blast.",
          "Magical experience and a very enjoyable day. Great rides although a couple were closed. Manageable queues made the day easier as we could do more in our time. Disappointed in the parade and unavailability of characters after experiencing Disneyworld. Wonderful day out ...but very expensive!",
          "Forever 5 stars. Download the app and get the max pass for more convenience getting the map, ride times, and fastpass plus so much more.",
          "Loved this place! Spent a good 3 days here. Great attention to detail! It's definitely worth the money. Hope I get to visit again!",
          "Disney land really is magical. The more I go, the more I appreciate the vibe as well as the rides. I recommend sitting somewhere with a view and just soaking it all in. \nThat said, it's getting more and more expensive every year. Supply and demand huh? \nRides are always broken too.",
          "Good time of year to go if you don't mind the rain. Lines not to bad. The food could stand to be a lot cheaper.",

          "WE LOVE DISNEYLAND! Thank You Walt for your incredible vision, glad you do not have to be here to see what the Disney Corporation is doing to your incredible Legacy. We try to go at least once or twice per year. Really is the Happiest Place \u2026",
          "Always a blast! Great place for families to spend time together. Smiles everywhere!",
          "Too little Christmas decorations, not nearly as good as four years ago. Prices too much for souvenirs, food. Seems to have lost Walt's mission of providing a place for parents to go with their kids. Only the well to do or those going into \u2026",
          "Always good and good with details. Only if we could get the other people visiting the park to be respectful",
          "Inviting and innovative place. Perfect for children and fun for the whole family. Food and items you wish to buy are expensive. Customer service is excellent overall.",
          "Overcrowded and expensive. The rides are fun but often take an hour or more in line. At least it is clean and well laid out.",
          "For that many people  Was pretty good the workers and everything we're very very polite",
          "Disneyland is amazing. I love it! Truly the happiest place on earth.",

          "As always, the happiest place on earth,  but packed to the gills. Of course it is the holidays. Have fun.",
          "Expensive and long queues. Tuesdays are probably the better choice. \nPirates of the Caribbean are still amongst the best riders and Indiana Jones.",
          "Definitely worth staying on the resort for the extra magic hour to get in the park before everyone else.",
          "Where the magic begins, we love disney, this is the happiest place on earth, would highly recommend a visit to enjoy the magic.",
          "The staff is always offering up some Disney Magic. The remodel was recently completed and the rooms look amazing! The restaurant's in Downtown Disney are overpriced. Of the three places I've been to, all three where bad experiences. Rude \u2026",

          "Great place to be no matter who you are",

          "The family loves it. I still hate spash mountain. Water in my shoes every single time no matter what.",
          "Haven't been here in years. It's way too expensive, even if I have lived in Orange County since 1972. If you really have some money to burn, you can patronize the \"Mouse House,\" too. Well, good luck!",
          "3rd trip to Disneyland this year and 1st trip for my year old daughter Disneyland was just as perfect as she is the majority of rides are for all ages including the tea cups and dumbo. We also loved the fantasmic experience cant wait to get back!!",

          "It was a nightmare to get tickets and we were told contradictory information that only made it worse. I'd like to say we had enough fun when we were finally able to get inside the park, it seemed like every other ride was down which \u2026",
          "Went to Trader Sam. The decor was fun and the drinks delicious (ALTHOUGH PRICEY). The only negative is that the seating is limited and when we were there a large group came in (about 15) and took up any floor space. The servers couldn't \u2026",
          "Let's  face it, Disneyland is the Magic Kingdom, and even though it has been 35 years since my last visit, every time I walk through the gates bring back h memories of my first visit in 1958. The park never gets old, as it was designed to \u2026",

          "So much fun. Walt Disney was a true visionary. We loved the rides, the fast pass system was great once you got used to it. The food was varied, if a little expensive. The only negative?

        "wiki": "Downtown Anaheim is the administrative and historic center of Anaheim, California. It is also known as Anaheim Colony Historic District and is bordered by East, West, North, and South streets.  The historic center of the city is Anaheim Blvd (originally named Los Angeles Street) and Center Street.  Unlike most big city downtowns, Downtown Anaheim is not the economic heart and focal point  of this city. The economic heart and focal point of Anaheim and Orange County is the adjacent district just south of Downtown Anaheim\u2014the Anaheim Resort District, which includes the Disneyland Resort and the Anaheim Convention Center. Another prominent district located south east of Downtown Anaheim, and adjacent to the Anaheim Resort, is the Platinum Triangle District.\n\n\n== Buildings and attractions ==\nThe Downtown Anaheim skyline consists of the Bank of America Building and the Wells Fargo Building, which are both over 10 stories high. Other high-rise buildings in Downtown Anaheim include City Hall, West City Hall, the AT&T Building, the Anaheim Memorial Manor, and the Kraemer Building. Anaheim Police Headquarters, Anaheim's Main Central Library, and the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce are also located in Downtown Anaheim. The \"Center Street Promenade\" consists of shops, restaurants, and Downtown Anaheim's Farmers Market. Other attractions in the Center Street Promenade include Anaheim's \"Art in Public Places\" Artwalk, and Anaheim's History Walk which was unveiled on June 20, 2007. Also near the Center Street Promenade are The Muzeo, a museum which opened in the Fall of 2007, and Anaheim Ice (formerly called \"Disney Ice\"), which is an ice skating rink opened to the public, and it also serves as the practice arena for the NHL team, the Anaheim Ducks. Also located in Anaheim's Colonial District is the oldest museum in Orange County \u2014 the Mother Colony House. The city park in Downtown Anaheim is Pearson Park, which was named after Charles Pearson, who served as Mayor of Anaheim when Disneyland opened its doors to the public in 1955. The Pearson Park Amphitheatre, an outdoor theater, is one of the big attractions in Pearson Park. The Anaheim Packing House is a gourmet food hall opened in 2014 in a former Sunkist packing house.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the days when Anaheim was a rural community surrounded by orange groves, the geographic center of town was at the intersection of Center Street and Los Angeles Street (now Center Street and Anaheim Blvd.) and the central business district was built around the center of town. Prior to the opening of Disneyland, the old business district consisted of establishments such as the SQR Department Store, Chung King Restaurant, and the Pickwick Hotel. Disneyland brought the need for expansion of the Heart of Anaheim. Prior to Walt Disney's death in 1966, The city of Anaheim had plans to construct a forty-story office tower on the other side of Ball Road from Disneyland. Walt Disney knew right off that the skyscraper would be seen from inside Disneyland, thus altering the theme park's atmosphere. Disney met with Anaheim city officials and an \"anti-skyline ordinance\" was passed, which stated that no high rise in Anaheim could be built which could be seen from inside Disneyland. This forced the city to expand its heart outward, instead of upward like most major cities do. Today, the heart of Anaheim consists of three districts: 1) Downtown Anaheim, 2) the Anaheim Resort, and 3) the Platinum Triangle. As Anaheim expanded outward more and more during the mid-late 1960s and 1970s, the old downtown district began to deteriorate. By the mid 1970s, Downtown Anaheim had succumbed entirely to urban blight. The city began the process of demolishing the old downtown district and replacing it with  a new Downtown District with a miniature skyline development. This process took a little more than fifteen years. The only structures from the old business district which still stand today are the old Carnegie Library, which is now the Muzeo, and the Kraemer Building (the old Bank of America Building) which was the tallest building in Anaheim prior to Disneyland's opening in 1955. The tallest building in Downtown Anaheim today is West City Hall, which is fourteen stories high. Currently, the tallest building in the entire city is the Anaheim Marriott Hotel which is nineteen stories high and located in the Anaheim Resort District.\n\n\n== New developments ==\nNew skyscrapers are planned for the city's A-Town Project, which is currently under construction in the Platinum Triangle District. A-Town is supposed to be Orange County's Main \"Downtown District\" once it is completed.  Downtown Anaheim's newest and most recent developments include the Muzeo, the Promenade @ Anaheim, Carnegie Plaza, and the Harbor Lofts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Anaheim\nDowntown Anaheim Official Website\nAnaheim Colony Historic District Links",

          "This is a good place to play mini golf as they have 4 courses so you can always pick the least crowded and it is easy to jump between courses if you arent keeping score(which we dont with a 4 yeasr old). The arcade part though is typical dark arcade filled with screaming kids",
          "Camelot is a fine, fun place for mini-golf and arcade games. Nothing particularly spectacular about the mini-golf. Four courses to choose from. We had fun nonetheless.",
          "Really great, well maintained courses, good value too. We played 2 of the 4 courses, each had similar holes but they were all good fun. There's also a laser tag, arcades and a waterpark here.",

          "Yes it's old, yes it's outdated and yes they need to clean it up, but the kids love it and it's good (not so clean) fun. If they would put some TLC back into this place it would be a big shot in the arm for business !",

          "Best fun around now that laser island moved to Upland.",
          "Had s grey time and enjoyed it. Would recommend and go again.",
          "Always liked coming as a kid. They keep the place pretty clean and there is parking for days. Now I bring the nieces and nephews and we always have a blast. Pizza is good but can be a bit pricey",
          "Lots to do, good value for your buck, flood was actually tasty and didn't taste like moody kids places.  Pretty clean and staff were cheerful. Great for parties, family fun, even a playful date.",
          "Great place too play video games and golf with the family! A little pricey though",
          "Been coming here for over 40 years. Back when Family Fun was next door. Sadly the condition of the putting courses look like they haven't been tended to in many many years.  Worn out paint, broken prop items. Carpet greens torn and ripped. \u2026",
          "Lazer Tag, Bumper boats,mini golf and more.... Great family fun!",
          "Full of fun memories from childhood revisiting Camelot as an adult was still fun. Although they may have lost some square footage they still pack the inside with more arcade games than ever before. The laser tag game on the second floor is \u2026",
          "Nice place to spend time with the family. The golf courses can be a little underwhelming but then again it is mini gold it can't be that exciting. lol",
          "Took my grandsons, laughed for 3 hours. Plenty of parking, and good fun for the money. Place is well kept.",
          "It's a fun place, but needs some upkeep on the maintenance. My group and I did mini golf and while it was entertaining, there are a ton of insects that will be in your face and get you pretty annoyed. Expect to feel lots of flies and mosquitoes on you. For the most part, the courses are still good to try.",
          "I have been visiting Golfland ever since I was a child. Each visit has been consistent. Good food, great service, cool arcade games, and of course, mini golf. People of all ages can definitely enjoy this place. My only complaint is some of the golf course stations are dirty or have trash on them. Other than that, there are no problems.",
          "Came here on a date, didn't disappoint. It's miniature golf what more can i say?",
          "If you like minigolf and being reminded of 90s amusement parks, this is your place. Not the biggest fan of the arcades, but I had a lot of fun on the mini golf course. Don't be like me though. Work on your short game and mind the water traps.",
          "Great place to have fun, but look out for the rude kids running around",
          "Fun time, rides were not in service but golfing was fun, the change from tickets to a card made it easy for game play and prize retrievals.",
          "Still a very fun and safe place for a family outing, or a date.",
          "Had a good time. Had a quick jaunt before the toddler lost his marbles. Food wasn't too expensive. But son had his first putt putt game here. First stroke went backwards\ud83e\udd14",
          "Great place for dates, or family fun love it!!! I wish more time was given at the go carts (it's only 5min a race)",
          "My Son and I are addicted to the Coin Game  in the front of Camelot to the right as you enter through the Doors.  Golfing is also fun, it just has gotten too expensive for us.  Laser Tag is also great.",
          "Kids had fun, but food is more expensive than the games and rides \ud83d\ude02. And why would you have deluxe nachos and not regular ...they couldn\u2019t explain that to my nephew \ud83d\ude02 he just wanted chips and cheese.  But they were like, you can buy the \u2026",

          "My kids had a blast playing mini golf and the arcade",
          "Could've let me stay and finish the hole I was at. 10pm came around and they immediately wanted us out of the golf course. Great place though. Very well maintained and clean.",

          "Would give 0 stars. Why would you kick the Craniacs out of the arcade? \ud83d\ude24",
          "Camelot's been great since I was young,  great having it around for my son now. I love that it is still super clean,  has upgraded its games,  offerings and digital cards that take both cash and credit cards. I'll continue to come back,  their staff was also great.",
          "Aside from my girlfriend cheating on the racing games I had a blast. Felt like a kid again!",
          "My boss booked a Tuesday evening funday for about 15 of us. He got a bundle of Miniature Golf, Lazer Tag, Pizza / Drink, oh and Race Cars. This was my first visit here,  neither Lazer Tag which was my favorite! I will definitely return with another group of not the same one!!",
          "A fun place to visit and kill a few hours with a variety of stuff to do. The mini golf course was really great!",

          "My kids love it here! I love it, pizza is really good and the pricing on everything is pretty good.",
          "Mini Golf and go carts were fun. Beware of the insects/small bugs while on the course and/or lights (out) on some areas. Bumper cars were inside in small area. Bumper boats were open but not being used during my visit. Parking had a fee that was returned in card to use during visit. Lots of arcades..",

          "Love all the options available. Golfing, Go Karts, Bumper Boats etc. Good place for parties and family gatherings.",
          "It's a really good place to go for day camps, church camps, and when you just want to have some quality time with family and friends. I would recommend it to everyone with children.",
          "Fun place with a variety of activities. No alcohol is served here. Laser tag harnesses are often broken so beware.",

          "Nice little place off the 91 freeway to play arcade games (kid ones) and mini golf. \nParking is $5 (cash) but they give you a card with credit so you can play some games.\nThere\u2019s an area for you to purchase food and drinks if wanted.\nMini \u2026",
          "The pizza is actually really good now and the staff is friendly and helpful! I think it's worth checking out for a day of family entertainment.",
          "Went for mini golf and was a blast but it was pretty busy. Once on the course it goes by nicely. Played all 18 holes in about an hour and a half to two hours.",
          "Love coming here to play laser joust and just hang with some friends.  Doesn't matter how old you are, it's always a good time",
          "Staff is friendly. This place is pretty old and rundown these days. The prices seem a bit high for what you get. Good sized arcade, will definitely keep your kids busy.",

          "Great Mini-Golf with good variety of courses. \nCan get extremely hot",
          "It changed alott... I was hoping to see marvel vs Capcom 2...was disappointed",
          "This is a great place to bring the kids. The Saturday gaming specials are very affordable. The reason for 3 stars is the conditions of the mini golf course and some of the games. The mini course needs some new turf. Some games seem to be \u2026",

          "Wonderful place for kids and adults. \nMini golf is great. Only issues we had were the steep little hills are not disabled friendly. And having to walk all the way back to the main area to get a ball everytime we lost a ball in the water is kinda of an inconvenience. \nOther than that over all fun and well priced.",
          "Years ago after they tore down the mini golf in the Disney resort area, we found Camelot. We have visited many summers while in OC. Fun activity for the whole family. Nice way to enjoy the warm sunny weather as well. There are a number of \u2026",

          "Great experience, alot of fun",
          "So, Camelot is a relatively inexpensive way to entertain a toddler, or perhaps take a date when the emphasis is more on conversation than the activity. It has a neat architectural design, it's always pretty clean and the miniature golf \u2026",
          "The arcade is fairly cheap. There are tons of arcade games to choose from and play. It uses a card and digital tickets. I haven't tried their food menu. The golf course is cheap and has 3 courses, each having 18 holes. Fun for the family or perfect for dates. The only thing you won't get, is a hole in one.",
          "The family and I had a great time and didn't cost us an arm and a leg either",
          "Lots of stuff to do, very fun!",
          "It's really a great place and lots to do there. We had a great time as we only did the Mini-Golf. They were putting up their Christmas decorations which was a nice treat! Taking away a star because the employees seemed like they didn't like their jobs and did the bare minimum without being too happy about it.",
          "They have a great deal on Saturday mornings. All you can play arcade games, golf,  and laser tag for $12. You can't turn in any tickets you win but so worth it! Had a great time, will definitely go back!",

          "Great place for mini golf. They have three different courses there and any age can play. The prices aren't too bad either. They also have bumper boats, bumper cars and an arcade here. Great place for a kids birthday or a night out with friends.",
          "Really cool place for a big party",
          "Really love this place, one of the best mini golf courses in all of the I.E. they have go-carts, bumper boats where you can wet each other. The arcade is pretty cool as well and food prices are cheap. Definitely recommend this for a family day or a date.",

Even though it is right by the freeway you can't hear the traffic at all. 4 different golf courses that are all very unique and create just the right amount of challenges. I thoroughly recommended this place!",

          "Fun place for mini golf, worth every buck.",
          "This was probably one of the best \"fun centers\" I've been to in a long time. The staff was all a little bored and robotic, but they aren't what makes the place fun. Lots of arcade games, four eighteen hole mini-golf courses, bumper carts, and go carts. Lots to do.",
          "Lots of family fun they always show great job keeping the golf course well maintained.",
          "The place is fun but the young staff needs to work on there people skills.",
          "Tons of fun. My family came here for the first time and we had a blast. We played a lot of games for great prices and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Mahalo nui :)",
          "It's a fun place, lots of things to do. The arcade is really expensive, but that just may be cuz I'm getting old. Video games ain't a quarter no more.",

          "Old school fun and games exist at Anaheim's other, smaller castle at Camelot Golfland. I always seem to visit Camelot Golfland when friends are in town. It boasts 4 old-school mid-century 18-hole mini golf courses that are challenging and \u2026",

          "Great place! Good golf and good food",
          "Great family fun place, so many fun things to do with kids, grandkids, family or friends.  You can spend all day there! Prices are about average for this type of place.",
          "Nice paint jobs but actual course needs repair.",
          "Place has lots of fun things to do but you should teach your staff  manners and customer service.  I lost a ball and asked a worker behind the counter to please give me a blue ball for my golf game with family.  He said to get in line where \u2026",

          "Great place to play arcade and spend time with family",
          "This place is very sad. Choose smartly. It looked awesome and like every kids dream. However their website is inaccurate. It said they were open until 10pm and the last laser tag starts 20 min before closing. We stopped in at 920 to get one \u2026",

          "The good: Ample free parking and lots of fun stuff to do such as: mini golf, laser tag, video games, and bumper cars. The bad is that it's pricey. Each item you have to pay for and it will add up quickly. My kids blew through $50 in video games in less than an hour.",

          "Not handicap fitted on mini golf course",
          "This place is phenomenal to mini golf ! Took my girl there today and she loved it. Really close to Downtown Disney to chill after a golf sesh. Really incredible ambiance. If you're on the fence of coming or have nothing to do, you need to come here ! You wont regret it (:",

          "The mini golf was super fun",
          "Same old mini golf course. \nThe arcade is updated and the food is a bit more expensive than it was some time ago. But its still fun to bring your child and let them win at mini golf. My little one had a blast and has already asked when we will go back. \nIt was about 20 dollars for the 2 of us to play through the courses.",
          "Still up there with most So-Cal mini-golf courses (alas, there aren\u2019t many these days), the place includes a large indoor arcade and waterslides. Sadly, one half of it\u2019s 5-star 1980\u2019s heyday, has been turned into an adjacent industrial park \u2026",
          "Checked the website before going, says it's open until eleven pm. Got there and found out it's actually ten. Well sort of..  Turns out they close pretty much everything at nine fifteen including the food area, laser tag, bumper cars, etc. \u2026",

          "Was a lot of fun! A little pricey though. The golf course was fun and challenging",
          "They can sure pack a lot into one block.  Kids enjoyed the miniature golf.  Though the crowd may be overwhelming (and hallways tight), the courses has some very creative experiences.",
          "Wide variety of activities  fun for everyone. Laser tag bumper boats go carts arcade and more.",
          "They sure can cram a lot into this castle/building! Definitely easy to keep the kids occupied. There's 4 different themed golf courses, each with 18 holes. It's right up against the freeway so it gets pretty loud in the early holes, but you tune it out by hole 5ish",
          "With the exception of better video games, not much has changed since I was a kid, literally.  I think it's the same decor from my 12th birthday, 30 some odd years ago. \n\nThe prices are reasonable, great rootbeer floats and the staff, I \u2026",
          "I've only been here twice, once many years ago and once recently, but I really enjoyed it both times. More recently I got to play a round of miniature golf and goof off in the arcade. I'm an adult and we didn't have any kids with us, we \u2026",
          "Had a blast in the heat by riding the water bumper boats, perfect for the hot weather! I could spend all day there with my grown up children, we we're all big kids for the day and also enjoyed the cars and arcades, great memories for sure!",

          "Fun activities, however the staff was generally disaffected and on their phones, and the 'no drugs/ alcohol' policy was loosely enforced: there were several clearly inebriated people stumbling around who were allowed to drive the go karts.",
          "Thought it was just mini golf.... was wrong! This place had a lot of things for my family and friends. Bumper boats, go kart races, lazer shooting, and arcades on top of mini golf. Lotsa room for private parties.",
          "Very great place to have fun as an adult or to take your kids. You will both love it. Their pizza and wings are super delicious and tasty.",
          "Everything was fine till we tried the go kart. The go kart supervisor's attitude was unacceptable. At first, he didn't tell us where to go and showed us his attitude after we went the wrong way. He didn't say a word the whole time, only pointing his fingers.",
          "Half of the games were shut off",
          "Great place for pokemon go.  Kids will like this place as well",

          "Spent my first 20 minutes looking for an employee so I could get into the course. Place is dreary could use a bit more lighting. Some of the arcade games were not working. The food was horrible and expensive, pizza was a thick wad of dough \u2026",

          "Great place for family fun! My kids love laser tag and water bumper boats.",
          "Good place to bring kismds of all ages. The challenge is it is hard to know where to go to buy passes for multiple things. You never know if you are getting the best deal.",
          "The facility was clean and neat. Every member of the staff we interacted with was polite and eager to help. The go carts and new bumper cars were a lot of fun. We had a great time.",

          "This mini golf place is great. It appeared to be very well taken care of, and in terms of golfing, there are multiple courses you can try out. They offer other entertainment, like a go cart track, but I think that I would rather just go to \u2026",
          "Went here for my birthday it was cool just expensive",
          "It's ok. The golf is fun but the arcade inside is   way over priced. The lowest arcade game is 5 points. Your stuck with points less than 5.",
          "We had some delicious pizza, and rode one of their roller coasters and it felt REAL  it was SO FUN... that place, kids just love it and there is something for everyone.  I wanted to ride the boats except didn't want to get wet...lol...",

          "Went on a Monday night around 7. No charge for parking, and it was not busy at all. Went just for mini-golf, which was about ~$20 for 2 people. The ambience at night was great, as all the holes were well-lit and the area was well-maintained \u2026",
          "Great place and prices for family fun or to have a date",
          "Miniature golf balls are plastic are terrible! Plastic golf ball are too light and have no distance control and accuracy. I wish this place would use real golf balls instead.",
          "Awesome golf courses. Great to bring kids and adults. They have 4 different golf courses and they have a twist to make things interesting. The food is a bit pricey.",

          "Lot's of cool fun for the whole family. Tried the #2 mini golf course, it was great!",
          "The unlimited arcade Saturday mornings are hard to beat. Everything is fair game and it's a reasonable price for everything you can do and 3 hours of nonstop play. Great for the kids and easy on the budget. Add in laser tag, mini golf, \u2026",
          "Nice place for nerds. I like how their fighting games and rhythm games have their little sections which is good idea for both casual and hardcore crowd. The arcade machines could use a little maintenance, but as a neighborhood theme park it is pretty decent.",
          "Took my siblings here and had a great time, cute miniature golf sets and a variety of other things to do! For arcade you get a card with credit and can replenish as many time as you'd like! They have laser tag, go carts, mini golf, arcade, etc... You are also able to book parties there for everyone to have fun!",
          "It was so much fun",
          "They recently updated their games and improved the free play Saturday games. They raised the price too, but it's still a good deal. Great time to spend with the family!",
          "Average mini golf. Sub-par arcade. All of the old style arcade games are gone and it resembles a half baked D&B or a kids version of Las Vegas but without the fun.",

          "Took my son to play putt putt golf. Was very impressed with the fact they have 4, 18 hole courses not to mention laser tag, video games, go carts and bumper cars. Drinks were a bit pricey.",
          "Really cool amusement center. You do have to pay for parking but it ends up being credit for you to use inside, what a commitment. $5 or if you're lucky, $0. \n\nThey have a mini golf and a variety of water and other activities in the back. \u2026",
          "Cheap and fun. Food is over priced for the quality but if you're hungry it does the trick!",

          "Golfing here with the kids is awesome. Not too expensive and great atmosphere. Wish they had better ventilation inside though.",
          "Good place for family. The best offer with games is bowling",

          "Lots of good memories, a little run down in spots, but they've done a great job remodeling all the stuff. Lazer tag is kind of spotty, but everything else is great. Good spot for birthday parties because kids can do whatever they want.",
          "I really love the miniature golf. Had the best time on the course especially since there are many different obstacles! Inside Camelot there are tons of arcades plus lots more! Anybody who goes here is going to have a blast in my opinion.",
          "awesome place! great value! i got the seasonal pass and had a blast on the mini golf courses! they are well maintained and really clean! it was a little busy for a sunday afternoon but the good part about that was having a bigger group for laser tag! a good sized room for laser tag too and a lot of fun! ",
          "Really enjoyed this course.  Greens are super fast.  Well maintained and fun to play.  $10 a game, so not cheap.",

          "Great place for mini golf. Seems to have a lot of fun activities for kids. The golf course is extensive and you can spend two hours going through the whole thing or just do the first 18 holes which takes about an hour. \n\nWasn't busy on a Monday night. ",

          "Fun if you have your own equipment to play.",
          "Over-priced. It is something to do with the family, but for the price; do something else.",
          "Good family fun.  Some of the lighting for the mini golf needs to be serviced..dark at times.  Prebuy family four pack prior to arrival for discount.  Shakes are massive from snack bar, definitely shareable.",
          "The mini golf here is WAY better than Boomers by FAR! The courses are newer and the couseses are more challenging! The go carts are also newer and better here. I would highly recommend this place over Boomers!",

          "Very clean, affordable and lots of choices",
          "Love this place! Great place to go with your family or friends, very cheap! I love the arcade, go carts & lazer tag! The only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars was because it could look better but its is fun!",

          "Straight out of 1979, a classic arcade but don't get to excited about the water slide that's broken and that may be in your best interest. The games were all good too but the food is not and it's expensive. Not a lot of room for large parties but free parking is nice. Miniature golf course improvements but they have a nice staff. ",
          "Your typical family fun center, minus go karts and batting cages. \n\nThey have 3 different mini golf courses and all 3 are a lot of fun with several water hazards. The courses are in pretty good shape as well. It's around $10 for each golf \u2026",

          "Fun place to visit. The atmosphere is very camelot. There are a few courses, but some look pretty old and worn out. The freeway that borders with the mini-golf makes it a bit noisy and unwelcoming. The arcade is fun, spacious and has a lot of games.",
          "I have never done mini golfing. Went with my family and had a great time. We did lose a ball around the 9th course. We didn't realize we could get a replacement ball. I would recommend mini golfing in the day light. It was great and look forward to my next visit with my nieces. ",

        "wiki": "The Disney Gallery is an attraction and merchandise location at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, United States. It opened at its current location on Main Street, U.S.A. on October 2, 2009. From 1987-2007 it was located in New Orleans Square above the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. The Gallery is a changing exhibition area focused primarily on artwork from Walt Disney Imagineering created in the designing of the Disneyland theme park. Merchandise relating to the current exhibition is usually available for purchase as well.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Royal Suite ===\nIn the early 1960s, as construction of New Orleans Square was proceeding, Walt Disney decided he needed a bigger entertaining facility for various VIPs that came to the Park. He already had an apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A., but it was too small to host extensive events. Walt decided to place the suite in New Orleans Square, away from the hustle and bustle of the park.\nWalt brought in set designer Dorothea Redmond, famous for the sets in Gone with the Wind, to help him with the apartment layout. To furnish and decorate the area, Walt left his wife Lilly and Walt Disney Studio set decorator Emile Kuri to collaborate, as they had on other projects (Club 33, the Firehouse Apartment, etc.). The project was christened The Royal Suite, after the street in New Orleans Square (Royal Street) the apartment's entrance is on.\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966. As a consequence, many projects at Walt Disney Productions were either put on hold or abandoned. The Royal Suite was abandoned at the request of the surviving brother, Roy. He felt that the family could not really enjoy The Royal Suite with Walt gone. The Suite was fairly close to completion at the time of Walt's death, including infrastructure and plumbing.\n\n\n=== New tenants ===\nThe Insurance Company of North America (INA) took over the location after the Disney apartment was abandoned. They retained Emile Kuri to decorate the space to approximate the look of the Disney apartment. INA renamed the apartment 21 Royal Street, after the apartment's numerical address. It served as a hospitality suite for INA employees and clients during their day at the park.\nINA moved out of the suite in 1974 and Disneyland International moved in, using the space as executive offices. DLI helped plan Tokyo Disneyland with the Oriental Land Company. There was even a large scale model of the park placed in one of the rooms so the Japanese executives could physically see the layout of their new park.\n\n\n=== The Gallery ===\nDLI moved out in the mid-1980s when they outgrew their headquarters. The space was left with an uncertain future. At the same time, Imagineer Tony Baxter was put on a project to improve guest traffic around the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. The queue for Pirates would get so long at times that it would block the walkway into New Orleans Square and Bear Country.\nBaxter finally decided on the current configuration, with the queue going underneath a themed footbridge, thereby freeing the walkway. He then set his sights on Walt's old Royal Suite, just above the queue. Baxter designed a pair of ornamental staircases that would hug the footbridge and create a unique frame for the building exterior. Baxter had thought that a beautiful place like Walt's suite was going to waste not being seen by park guests.\nBaxter asked recently elected Walt Disney Company President and COO Frank Wells what the plans were for the upstairs area. Wells said that Club 33 was vying for the space in order to add more membership slots. Baxter came to Wells with an idea for an art gallery open to park guests. The Imagineers had always wanted a place to display their artwork for the theme parks, which went largely unseen by the public. The Disney Gallery was born.The gallery is unique in all of Disneyland because it is the only location in the entire park that is listed as both an attraction and a merchandise location on the park's map. The cast members who work the location are from the Disneyland Merchandise division, but are specially trained to run the gallery as a museum. Cast Members are encouraged to give guests free tours of the gallery, informing visitors of the facility's rich history and the current exhibition.\nThe Gallery's New Orleans Square location closed its doors on August 7, 2007. The space was turned into the Disneyland Dream Suite. Imagineers converted the space into a two-bedroom, two-bath guest suite, using the original 1960s designs created by designer Dorothea Redmond and set decorator Emile Kuri in consultation with Walt Disney. Walt Disney Imagineering Art Director Kim Irvine says that the suite would \"be filled with things that might have inspired Walt as he dreamed of Disneyland.\" Each of the bedrooms feature a special nighttime lighting effect, activated at the push of a button.\n\n\n=== Current location ===\nThe Gallery opened at its current location on Main Street U.S.A. on October 2, 2009 in the space previously occupied by the Annual Passport Center/Bank of Main Street U.S.A.\n\n\n== New Orleans Square Gallery layout ==\nThe Disney Gallery comprised several rooms and antechambers, as it was designed to be living quarters for the Disney family. Each room contained its own set of artwork and usually revolved around a certain theme that pertained to the overall exhibit.\n\n\n=== Front Room/Formal Sitting Room ===\nThe first room guests walked into was known as the Front Room. This was the introductory room to the exhibit and set the stage for what lay ahead. Artwork in this room was usually more broad, getting more specific as guests progressed through the room.\nAs the Royal Suite, this room was known as the Formal Sitting Room. This is where Walt's guests would have spent most of their time, both before and after a meal. The guest entrance from the staircase was originally just another window when the building was first constructed. The balcony with the Pirates of the Caribbean marquee on the front was originally a false balcony and had to be reinforced to accommodate people.\n\n\n=== Vestibule ===\nTo the left of the front room was the vestibule. This miniature hallway contained two rooms that were off-limits to guests. Upon entering the vestibule, the door on the right led to the print room, which was the nerve center for the gallery's Art-on-Demand system. When the gallery opened this room was an administrative office, used for training and other purposes. The room on the left led to a small office that was used by the management of the gallery.\nThe two rooms were originally designed for two very distinct purposes. The manager office was intended to be a men's smoking lounge. Walt Disney was a smoker for most of his life (and actually died from causes related to lung cancer) and planned on having a separate, ventilated room where he and his friends could light up without making anyone else uncomfortable. The print room's intended use is not clearly known, though it is presumed the room was going to be used as a guest room or a room for Walt's grandchildren to play in.\n\n\n=== Collector's Room/Informal Sitting Room ===\nThe room to the right of the Front Room was known as the Collector's Room. The retail operation of the Gallery was located here. The merchandise changed with the exhibition, but some mainstays of the Gallery have been miniature, matted, vintage attraction posters and books about Disney art and Disney history.\nThe Art-on-Demand kiosks were also located here, allowing guests to choose a specific picture and have that picture custom printed for them. The system has been popular with longtime guests and offers a less-expensive alternative to lithographs, giclees, and other expensive pieces. The prints come in different sizes, with prices ranging from $15 \u2013 $50. Framing for these and other pieces is also available.\nThis room was originally known as the Informal Sitting Room. Often compared to a modern-day den, the Informal Sitting Room was a place for Walt and his guests to sit and relax before and after dinner. It is likely that the television would have gone in this room. There was also going to be a wet bar (used as a cash register area for the Gallery), where Walt could have mixed fancy drinks and served appetizers for his guests. Cast Members like to point out the Sub-Zero miniature refrigerator, as it is the same one installed in 1966, and it still works.\n\n\n=== Balcony ===\nThe Collector's Room was the only way to access the Gallery's expansive balcony. Guests could sit up in the Balcony and people watch as long as they want. In the evening, the Gallery Balcony was used as a hard-ticket seating area for the Fantasmic! river show. The seats included an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet with unlimited soft drinks and coffee. The price was very steep and usually coincides with the price of Park admission.\nThe Balcony holds very distinctive evidence that the Disney brothers were going to share The Royal Suite. Within the wrought iron of the Balcony's barrier are the initials \"WD\" and \"RD\", for \"Walt Disney\" and \"Roy Disney\". The initials are so expertly crafted that they do not stand out from the rest of the ironwork.\nThe balcony is the only area in the entire gallery where Walt Disney actually stood.\n\n\n=== Back Hallway/Grand Entrance ===\nTraveling through the Collector's Room, guests would find the Back Hallway. This area was originally used to display collector's lithographs and other framed artwork. Sample Art-on-Demand pieces also hung in this area. In the later days of the Gallery this area was used as another exhibit room displaying artwork for viewing.\nThe Back Hallway was originally the Grand Entrance to the Disney apartment. The door at the rear is connected to the ground floor by a nondescript flight of stairs located in a small courtyard (the Royal Courtyard is currently occupied by an extension of the Pieces of Eight shop). The marker that denotes the address of the apartment still stands. The staircase and back door is considered off-limits to guests.\n\n\n=== Blue Room/Formal Dining Room ===\nThe room to the right of the Back Hallway was known as the Blue Room. The name came from the color of the wall when the Gallery first opened. This was the largest exhibit area until early 2007, when the room was divided in half. One half was given to Club 33 as storage space which was then turned into Club 33's kitchen. The half that remained as the Gallery was a more intimate space. When the Blue Room was whole, a side balcony on the far side of the room was used as a VIP seating area for Fantasmic! This balcony was off-limits to guests at all times, and was only reserved for special guests of The Walt Disney Company.\nThis room would have been The Royal Suite's Formal Dining Room. Originally rectangular in shape, it would have accommodated a large dining room table that could have probably seated 15 - 20 guests. On the far side of the room was an outline for a doorway that would have led to the Club 33 kitchen. The Royal Suite had no real kitchen, so it was necessary for the Club's chefs to provide all the meals.\n\n\n=== Patio ===\n\nThe Patio was the \"hub\" of the Gallery, with almost every room attached to it. The Patio contained tables and chairs, where guests could bring up food and have a meal away from the bustling crowds of the rest of the Park.\nOriginally conceived by Lillian Disney, the Patio was a place where Lilly could be outdoors, but away from the Park guests. Lilly also purchased the bronze fountain head sculpture, as well as other antiques located throughout the Gallery. Since she was a lover of plants, Lilly had planters installed wherever possible.\nWalt also had a hand in the design of the Patio. There are air conditioning ducts located on the eaves of the roof, surrounding the patio. This was a system that Walt was experimenting with to provide air conditioning outdoors. The ducts in the eaves would provide an invisible barrier, while the ducts located underneath the eaves would actually regulate the temperature. It was never hooked up and never used.\n\n\n=== Green Room/Master Bedroom ===\nTo left of the patio, cut off from the rest of the Gallery was the Green Room, named for the same reason as the Blue Room. This room changed little since the Gallery opened and was the largest display area in the Gallery\nThe room was tucked away from the rest of the Gallery because it was going to be used as the Master Bedroom. Lilly enjoyed her privacy and wanted the bedroom to be essentially off-limits to their guests. A large bay window was located next to the bedroom door (later covered by another display wall) so that Lilly could look out onto her garden patio, even when inside the room. The Master Bedroom also had a bathroom with a marble sink top, a shower alcove, and a toilet; there was no tub. The bathroom space was used as a merchandise stockroom and remained locked at all times.\n\n\n== Exhibition history ==\nSince its opening on July 11, 1987, The Disney Gallery had changing exhibits to keep things fresh and current. The length of the exhibits ranged from ten years to three months.\n\n\n== Other locations ==\nThe first Walt Disney Gallery was opened outside of the park next to the Disney Store, Main Place Santa Ana mall in California on November 4, 1994 and was operated by Disney Store, under Doug Murphy, vice president of the Walt Disney Gallery. The prototype store was designed by Disney Imagineering.The 3,100-square-foot store used a museum shop method for its products organized into four sections, The Animation Gallery, The Contemporary Gallery, Vintage Disney and The Gallery Shop. Doug Murphy was hired by Disney Store as manager of new business development in September 1991 promoted to head business development in April 1993 then appointed vice president of the Walt Disney Gallery for Disney Store in December 1994. In late May 1995, the store held a meet and discussion with Beauty and the Beast musical costume designer Ann Hould-Ward and offering some of her work, limited edition lithographs, original watercolor sketches, line drawing and works-in-progress collages, plus film's animation.The main product lines are Disney animation art, collectibles, fashions and home accessories. This location was stocked with high-priced animation art, dinnerware, flatware, Lladr\u00f3 figures, fashion, laser discs and research books. The feature artists included Amadio-Smith Raku, Bob Kliss and Paul Butler. The store was later closed. Fashion items included marcasite cuff links and necklaces by Judith Jack, Kathrine Baumann designed pave minaudi\u00e8re and purse accessories, sterling silver by Judy Kuo and Bill Schiffer and G\u00e9rald Genta designed watches. Also, Nicole Miller designed a collection sold there that included backpack, eyewear case and toiletry kit. Items from Disney's private label were of higher quality. Baumann's limited edition minaudieres\u2014-crystal covered purses shaped in the heads of Mickey and Minnie Mouse generated the most conversation. At $1,600, these jewelry boxes have been purchased by cereal heiress Mercedes Kellogg Bass, Michael Eisner's wife, Jane, diet guru Jenny Craig and others.By 2006, another location opened in Downtown Disney, Orlando.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of past Disneyland attractions\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Disney Gallery page on Disneyland website",

        "wiki": "Knott's Berry Farm is a 57-acre (23 ha) theme park located in Buena Park, California, owned and operated by Cedar Fair. In 2018, it was the twelfth-most-visited theme park in North America and averages approximately 4 million visitors per year. The park features 40 rides including roller coasters, family rides, dark rides and water rides.\nThe theme park began in the 1920s as a road-side berry stand run by Walter Knott along State Route 39 in California. By the 1940s, a restaurant, several shops, and other attractions had been constructed on the property to entertain a growing number of visitors, including a replica ghost town. The site continued its transformation into a modern amusement park over the next two decades, and an admission charge was added in 1968. In 1997 the park was sold to Cedar Fair for $300 million, just two years after the Knott's food business was acquired by Conagra, Inc. in 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nThe park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning in the mid 1920s, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.\" The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \"summer-long county fair.\"\n\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico Log Ride (the original name of the Timber Mountain Log Ride) opened in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there. According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00e9fense:\n\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes, Roaring Twenties rethemed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales. Then with the northward expansion of a 1920s-era Knott's Airfield themed area featuring the Cloud 9 Dance Hall, Sky Cabin/Sky Jump and Motorcycle Chase steeplechase roller coaster above the electric guided rail Gasoline Alley car ride.Sky Tower with the illuminated \"K\" in logo script at the top was built to support two attractions, the Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. The Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. Its ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. It is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+ mph or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\nMotorcycle Chase, modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together. One or two riders straddled each \"Indian motorcycle\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \"the road\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value. Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be rethemed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles themed to look like soap box racers, each seating two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980.\nMotorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed in 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Calico Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \"Urban Cowboy\" era. The \"Calico Barn Dance\" was featured in Knott's TV commercials.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\n\nKingdom of the Dinosaurs (1987) (primeval retheme of Knott's Bear-y Tales)\nCalico River Rapids (former Bigfoot Rapids, 1988), a whitewater river rafting ride as the centerpiece of the new themed area Wild Water Wilderness.The Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\nMystery Lodge (1994), inspired by General Motors \"Spirit Lodge\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper's ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia. Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests \"move inside\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\n\n\n=== New owners ===\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.In 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Inc, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.In 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\n\n\n=== Cedar Fair era to present ===\n\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed. Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.On May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gliders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Coast rider and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gliders and Pacific Scrambler. The HangTime roller coaster was also celebrated for apart of the Boardwalk expansion.\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major six-month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.\n\nDuring the fall of 2019, Knott's Berry Farm announced the return of Knott\u2019s Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair 4D dark ride.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Annual park events ==\n\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from a Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough. He dressed up in a gorilla suit and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly. During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \"haunted house\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \"scare zones\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scattered\u2014often hidden out of view\u2014throughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer. Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal, although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years. During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.Season of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \"solace\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\nA Christmas event known as \"Knott's Merry Farm\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented for many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n== Current areas and attractions ==\nThe park consists of four themed areas:\n\nGhost Town\nFiesta Village\nThe Boardwalk\nCamp Snoopy\n\n\n=== Ghost Town ===\n\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Calico River Rapids (former Bigfoot Rapids), still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \"Twenty Mule Team\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainments\u2014during \"Knott's Merry Farm,\" two small productions of \"The Gift of the Magi\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \"genuine illegal hitchin'\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History \u2013 Ghost Town \u2013 Calico' section above. The park formerly featured a 5th area called the Wild Water Wilderness. Formerly known as Wild Water Wilderness, now part of Ghost Town, that features two major rides: the Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008 and Calico River Rapids which opened in 2019. Nearby Pony Express is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\n\n\n=== Fiesta Village ===\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci\u00f3n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\n\n\n=== The Boardwalk ===\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the place of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.\nThe world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550 m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\n\n\n=== Camp Snoopy ===\n\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children's rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \"Peanuts\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Rapid River Run, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilling rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relatively tame.\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy received a makeover for its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm opened up new rides in Camp Snoopy.The 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge Grand Sierra Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet. As part of the 30th Anniversary makeover, the train ride received a series of Peanuts vignettes made by Garner Holt Productions) along the track and narration by the character Linus.\n\n\n=== Indian Trails ===\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance.\n\n\n=== Public area ===\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.\n\n\n==== East property ====\n\nThe east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.\n\n\n== Former attractions ==\n\n\n=== FearVR: 5150 controversy ===\nFor Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm introduced FearVR: 5150, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness. The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients. The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined \"a danger to themselves or others\". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\". In response, Cedar Fair removed \"5150\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut. A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\".\n\n\n== Knott's Soak City ==\n\nKnott's Soak City is a water park. It opened in June 17, 2000 as Soak City U.S.A. It requires separate admission from Knott's Berry Farm. In addition to the water park across the street from the main theme park, Cedar Fair also formerly owned two satellite Knott's Soak City Parks, in Palm Springs and Chula Vista.\n\n\n== Private police force ==\nFor much of the park's early history, Knott's Berry Farm had a unique arrangement with the Orange County Sheriff Department where the park's security officers were sworn special deputies vested with full police powers. The Security Department, however, did not answer to the county sheriff, but rather to the park's Chief of Security (who for many years was Steve Knott, the grandson of Walter Knott). Knott's Berry Farm maintained a completely private police force, vested with full police powers, and overseen by park management.\nBefore the City of Buena Park was incorporated, Knott's Berry Farm's Security Department even provided police services to the nearby unincorporated area that would eventually become known as Buena Park, including writing traffic tickets. Then, in the early days of the incorporated City of Buena Park, Knott's Berry Farm Security provided vital mutual aid assistance to the Buena Park Police Department (formerly Buena Park Public Safety) during emergencies since Knott's Berry Farm's 34 sworn Special Deputies outnumbered, and were better equipped than the city's four-man Department of Public Safety.The Orange County Sheriff Department discontinued this arrangement in the late 1980s but Knott's still maintains its own private (albeit un-sworn) security force, and its \"Station-K\" public safety radio designation.\n\n\n== Food products ==\nThe J.M. Smucker Company continues to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family; however, other products, such as the syrups, have been discontinued due to low demand.In November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their \"Berry Market\" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all-natural. They are unable to use \"Knott's\" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.\n\n\n== Public transportation ==\nKnott's Berry Farm can easily be accessed by public transportation. Service is available by the Los Angeles Metro, the Orange County Transportation Authority, and Anaheim Resort Transit. Bus routes serving the park include Metro Express Line 460 which provides direct express service between Downtown Los Angeles and Disneyland OCTA bus routes 29, 38 and 529 and Anaheim Resort Transit route 18.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSummer School starring Mark Harmon and Kirstie Alley. Mr. Shoop (Harmon) takes his band of under-achieving students on a field trip to Knott's Berry Farm (among other places) instead of teaching them.\nIn episode 13 of The Big Bang Theory, \"The Bat Jar Conjecture\", (first aired April 21, 2008) character Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) informs the group that seasoned physics bowl competitors Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, and McNair won't be forming a team for the year's competition as the group had formed a barbershop quartet and \"got a gig playing Knott's Berry Farm\", thus paving the way for the show's characters to achieve victory.\nKnocked up starring Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl. The film's opening sequence shows several shots of Knott's Berry Farm and characters in the film riding several attractions in the park.\nFuture entertainers: Christian author Stormie Omartian, comedian Steve Martin, the creator of Las Vegas \"Legends In Concert\" and the worldwide impersonation empire; John Stuart, and Kathy Westmoreland (back-up singer for Elvis Presley); actor Dean Jones all worked at the Birdcage Theater.\nIn Season 4, episode 18, of the sitcom, I Love Lucy, Fred asks if they are still going to Knotts Berry Farm that day. \n\n\n== Attendance ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOld Maizeland School a California Historic Landmark (No.729) at Knott's Berry Farm\nDisneyland\nSix Flags\nWalt Disney World\nSeaWorld\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKnott's Berry Farm at the Roller Coaster DataBase",

I generally don't have as good of a time at Skyzone as I do at other parks like Aerosports or Rockin Jump because they just go overboard with shoving the rules down your throat.

          "Kids ran like crazy and burnt off a lot of energy. A great place to stop and have an adult break, ahhaha. I would recommend setting a meet up place for you and kids to meet at as it is very easy to loose site of them",
          "We've been here a few times before many years ago, but this time both our 9 year old and 3 year old loved this place. They did everything except the flying fox (as there was a long queue). They loved the rope walkways, the climbing wall, the slides and the animal sounds.",
          "We stopped in here on our recent trip. My kids are older and didn't want to meet Santa, but we were able to still explore this area without getting in the Santa queue. My 15 year old son (very active kid) was dragging his feet and was ready to leave the park, but his face",
          "This place is so neat and has so much to offer! We were there for the Oogie Boogie Party and it was totally transformed into an eerie fog laden haunt. Soooo cool!!!!",
          "This gem of a location is a parent's dream. An enclosed attraction that encourages the kids to roam and explore in a safe environment.",
          "My grandson, 8, loved this great little area. I actually enjoyed going through the course as well. Beautifully landscaped and built. I really felt like we were in the forest.",
          "I really like the Redwood Creek Challenge to get the family out running around together. It's a great way to burn off some energy and have a lot of fun doing it. It's also a good experience for many of the younger ones like my 3 year old granddaughter. There's a small rock",
          "The title says it. I enjoyed walking through here with the kids. They both loved it, and had fun while there",
          "This is so much fun with all the ropes, bridges and things to walk on. This is so much fun to do! \ud83d\ude03",
          "Let the kids play on the oversized jungle gym and you can sit and relax. There\u2019s only one way in and out, so they are pretty safe.",
          "This turned out to be my older (70) friend's favourite part of California Adventure! The trees, the trails, she even tried the slide. I think it would be a wonderful place for smaller people to defuse after the crowds and hype of Pixar Piers. I have just walked by this",
          "This fun little forest park is a great place to take younger kids when your feet need a rest. They make you feel like your in a national park and there's lots of fun activities for the kids. My granddaughter enjoyed the duck races with Chip and Dale and there's also a zip line",
          "Great place for parents and little ones to take a break while bigger kids burn some energy. Our kids loved this and hey no lines!!",
          "Really good hands on, old-timey stuff for kids. Fun for adults, as well. Nice scenery in a fairly quiet setting. No waiting line that I've ever seen",
          "During the holidays they have Santa there along with different holiday activities but even during the rest of the year, there is an obstacle course that will get the kids' wiggles out.",
          "Nice to have some physical play in the middle of the day while standing in long lines and sitting on rides. Chip and Dale were found in this area and Santa.",
          "A nice place to enjoy the walkways or just sit and relax in the cool. Suitable for everyone. The children all have fun there are characters here to meet.",
          "If your kids are getting antsy to run around and do what THEY want for a while, take them over to the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail at DCA. It's like visiting a state park in the middle of Anaheim. Lots of things to climb on and touch and explore. I just wish I was still",
          "Believe or not, but this challenging trail is literally a playground for kids big and small, adults are welcome too! If you are still waiting for your FastPass time, do take a few minutes of your day to enjoy the fun in nature!",
          "Great spot to take a break from the hustle of Disney CA Adventure park. Located just beyond the Grizzly River Run ride entrance (as you walk in from the main gate). Nice spot for people of all ages to have fun or just relax. Our favorite spot is Kenai's spirit cave in the far",
          "my 14 yr old son convinced me to do the challenge trail well at my age of 51 i felt like a big kid and also a bit nervous cause im not that young anymore but i had done it with my son he loved it and had a good laugh at me ause i was going so slow",
          "This was real fun! It was different and was a great place for the kids to run around and explore! When we went, it wasn't very busy and that made it nice too.",
          "After two days of waiting and riding at Disneyland the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail was exactly what our kids needed. We love visiting National Park Service sites and the Grizzly Peak section of Disneyland is set up to resemble one. This area in particular allowed the kids to",
          "We had not idea this even existed. Another park goer told us about it . My daughter loved the zipline and rock wall.",
          "We spent ages in here, and still didnt manage to do all of the activities. It is usually quiet compared to the parks, a nice place to chill, and lets the kids have a play.",
          "This is a great opportunity to step out of the theme park and into the great outdoors. You can smell the pine trees as you enter this woodland area of California Adventures. It's truly a little getaway and the perfect place to let the kids run around in the cool shade. It's",
          "Fun place to get waya from Disney without leaving the parks. You can relax and feel like you are in nature. Plenty oraganized and free play ideas for kids. good spot to relax and let them play.",
          "This is a great place where kids can run around and parents can sit down for a while. There are various things for kids to do such as a huge rope bridge, slides, inner tube zip lines, caves to explore and more.",
          "The kids could easily run around in there for HOURS. It's like a gigantic park with slides, ropes and even a zip line. LOTS of seating for parent of older kids who can just let theirs GO! Wonderful and not too crowded, especially in the morning.",
          "Great place to have a seat and watch to grandkids play - only thing is if your little kids want to climb the rock wall they have to have closed toes shoes - no flip flops",
          "Spent about 20 minutes here on zip line, climbing, etc. Met Chip (Dale was somewhere else...) 9- and 12-year old liked it.",
          "Our kiddos loved playing in this area. It was definitely not crowded and was fairly quiet. It allowed all of us to just relax a little and get out of the heat since it was fairly shaded.",
          "We stopped I. Here to let the boys wonder free a bit. I think this would be great for little ones to be able to stretch out and enjoy the climbing area.",
          "this is a great place to take a break the kids actually went a little too crazy while we were here because it lets them be really on their own and alot of areas the parents can't get to but it is safe and fun",
          "A nice quiet spot in California Adventure park. Young children can run and play, while adults can relax in the shade. There are educational activities to keep the little ones entertained.",
          "This is a great place for kids to blow off some steam after waiting in lines. Chip n Dale are often found running around and playing also which can add to the experience.",
          "Loved the nature in this part of the park. Kids really enjoyed climbing through the ropes, logs, tunnels, and caves in the back corner too. We found a quiet corner in this area to sit and eat our packed lunch.",
          "This is fun as kids have something to do, instead of sitting on their bottoms in a passive fashion. Probably five and up will enjoy it.",
          "If you need a place for you kids to run and explore within a disney park then this is the place, while it is as crowded as a normal playground there is ample cast members supervising and your kids can just play and relax for awhile instead of walking from ride to ride. There are",
          "You can get lost in this attraction for hours! There is so much to do and it is great for children younger than ten. There are some sections that adults can do but beware you must have comfortable clothes because you have to do some climbing!",
          "My grandkids loved this area. My grandson is 5 years old and loved everything about it. We must have visited this area 3-4 times during our visit. The park was packed, but this area was not too bad.",
          "I thought this was a lovely little area and had fun activities. Be careful crossing the rope bridges. My foot got stuck! We saw Chip and Dale running around the trail, so that made it extra fun. Make sure you howl like a wolf if you go down the slide!",
          "Everyone is so happy in this little place. Staff really helps out with the little ones. Big and small get to have a lot of fun without lines.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed this peaceful and nice area of California Adventure park. It is located kinda back in a corner in Grizzly Peak and looks like a little nature walk/mini national forest park with some cool activities for kids and adults. I enjoyed the rope bridges and",
          "This is a fun challenge trail mostly for older kids. There is a swinging tire, rope bridges and rock wall. There is a lot of information to learn about the wilderness. Adults might find some of the activities strenuous.",
          "We had a little time to kill before a fast pass and this area was really fun! There are great areas for little kids to check out along with fun climbing and tire swing type things for bigger kids. There is also a big shaded area down below that is great for stopping to get out",
          "This area is so pretty! It's a beautiful part of the park and contains a lot of educational info about indigenous animals and the National Parks in California. The actual attraction, though needs a little more organization. It's not clear what the activities are that the kids",
          "Did this with our 2 year old grandson. We all laughed, us a little more then him. Everything was fun and line was short on a Thursday in May. We used a touring plan however and it was a real time saver.",
          "After a few hours of hustling around the Park, waiting in lines, the Redwood Creek Trail is a nice respite. Kids have fun climbing and sliding and exploring, adults can explore too or relax on one of the many benches. There is a rope climb area which I would recommend wearing",
          "As a place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of Disney California adventure this is the place to be, slides, flying foxes and a huge climbing structure, this is the place to be, no queuing just running around,, good fun, and as a hint be nice to the rangers as they have",
          "This is really for the kids. They can climb up and down, go for a slide, swing on the ropes and find out what animal they are. Kids love it!!!",
          "Ts a self type, the setting had actual yes from areas in Ca.Also, it's a learning experience made fun, findings tracks of animals and matching them. There's plenty of play yard equipment for kids to climb thru, slide, crawl, etc. For adults, it's a nice break from the busy park",
          "Disney Parks are known above all else for the rides... most of us (or at least me) have a tendency to spend a lot of time waiting in line for rides and as a result might miss out on some of the less thrilling but equally entertaining attractions. Redwood Creek Challenge Trail is",
          "This will be something that will get your exercise in for the day. You get a wilderness explorer brochure and you go through the attraction earning badges. The badges are active and physical for the most part so there are obstacle courses and things to climb on. A fun place",
          "Do you feel like you are being lazy on your vacation to Disneyland? Then The Redwood Creek Challenge Trail is for you! It is really fun for kids ages 5-12. There are a lot of things to climb on and get the wiggles out. I would recommend this attraction for people with",
          "This activity is located inside California adventure near grizzly river Rapids ride. There are wooden suspension bridges. Also, rope netted area to relax on. Caves with some activities to do which kids would like. Water areas too. More for kids under 13.",
          "Fun place to eat up some time and keep the kids entertained. Deep in the heart of Disney's California Adventure. This \"challenge trail\" has lots of activities for the kids. Adults can tag along and do a lot of them too. Ropes courses, rock climbing, rope swings, cargo net",
          "I have always seemed to avoid the challenge trail because it is not a show, or ride, or character, or shop, or one of the many things I prefer to do first while in Disneyland. I forget though that sometimes when you waiting in lines the kids get bored, you get irritated and to",
          "there is an extensive rope bridge, tire zip line, small climbing wall, slides etc. THere is enough space for kids to run around and get tired. THere is a height limit for the zip line- can't be taller than a certain height so tweens beware.",
          "This is the place to go to get away from the crowds. The kids can run around and there a little activities for them to do throughout the trails. There are also characters and a show farther down.",
          "Even though my kids aren't very out doorsy they loved this area, it is nice to take a break from the rides and lines and just let them run around for a while.",
          "Think Giant Jungle Gym. There is a Rockwall of sorts, some slides, a cave, and an above ground trial. It's not a ride, but the kids get a pamphlet with the different activities at the play area, and as they complete the 6 or 7 activities they get to scratch off the merit badges",
          "More suited for kids as they have mini obstacle courses. But there is something for adults as well - you can walk on the hanging bridges which does facilitate some leg muscle exercise.",
          "The guide gives them a map and the adventure begins. Lots of different activities to do that will keep the kids entertained easily for an hour. No a good place to go if your in a hurry because our kids did not want to leave and do anything else. Probably did the big slides 20",
          "This is a great adventure filled with trails and activities. You get a map to check off areas of activities and get an explorer badge at the end.",
          "Lots of fun things for the kiddos to do! Parents and follow along and do most of the activities with the kids. Love it! With the activities the adults are not allowed on you can watch your kiddo close by. Nice shady spots to rest and get some shade!",
          "This is a nice quiet fun energizing activity and great to do to escape the business of the park. Lots of energy used climbing rock walls, scrambling across rope bridges and learning fun facts about animals and collect Wilderness Explorer Badges. TIP: Wear running / walking shoes.",
          "Best place to unwind and lets the kids run around. Plenty of places to sit and get some shade and rest those feet",
          "So if you want your kids to be worn out before day's end or just let them run loose, THIS IS THE PLACE! This is like the ultimate playground for kids!!! They have two giant slides, rope bridges, tunnels, climbing opportunities, it's GREAT!! Kids really have a run at the",
          "This was a great place to let our little one burn off some energy after a long day of lines at the park. We even ran into Chip and Dale!",
          "This was my toddler's favorite part of DCA. He could have spent hours here. They also had a photopass photographer on hand who took a lot of fun photos with families.",
          "We spent around 45 minutes here with all three boys loving what was on offer (and me as an adult boy also). Lots of climbing, running and shade, with zip-wire, huge net climbing frame, tube and other slides, and plentiful fountain water to drink. Would recommend this and agree",
          "This place has lots of climbing, and running and playing, my nephew age 7 and my son age 11 are very happy here. They explore. They run and climb. Bring your bottled water, the kids get thirsty.",
          "My 7 year old had so much fun running the trail and collecting stamps! It was the perfect way to burn off some of the energy from being in lines all day long. Also a really fun way to dry off after a few rounds on Grizzly River Run!",
          "There is a lot for kids to do here with minimal to no wait. The only wait (about ten minutes) was for the zip line. Otherwise there are rope bridges and the like galore. It was one of our first activities at Disney and we enjoyed it tremendously.",
          "My 25 yr old son and his 53 yr old mom had a great time on this little adventure, loved this area. Not to be missed.",
          "After one your and a half in the queue they informed us that it was damaged and that is....nothing else.",
          "Great for my 5 and 6 year old. So much to do and helpful staff!!! My 5 year old loved the zipline better than any ride in the park!!!",
          "If you have high energy kids and they are kind of going crazy, then this is the place to let them run around and get out some of the pinned up energy. There are all kinds of low tech stuff to do. This is mainly for middle school and lower children, didn't see too many older",
          "This is a great spot for the kids to run around and burn some energy at California Adventures. Our two boys (8 & 13) enjoyed the climbing and rope bridges. There is a little treasure hunt they can do to earn a sticker but you can just explore if you like. If you aredoing the",
          "I never would have found this place had it not been for the recommendation of a family member. It's a really great place that is laid out well and has activities for all ages. Being from California, I can appreciate the way it was set up from the big Sequoias to the fire",
          "This is the second time we have done this challenge. Coming to Disney this time I assumed we would not do this again. However, it turns out this is pone of the best attractions to give younger kids something to do. They miss out on a lot of the rides and don't get all the",
          "Bet you'll walk right by. We did several times, before we took our 6 year old grandson in. What a pleasant surprise! Our 11 year old grandson went later and had fun, too. Rock climbing, zip lines, look out towers, rope bridges- they're all here.",
          "The Redwood Creek Challenge Trail is so much fun for kids. Ideal location for kids to burn off extra energy as adults sit in the shade on hot LA days. Loads to learn plus Dale turned up for a photo op.",
          "This is a \"park\" where kids can run around, go on slides and climb rope ladders. It is perfect to let kids use some of their energy...",
          "Take the time to explore Redwood Creek. Most people walk right past and don't experience the fun that awaits inside this hidden gem. Climb, swing, go down the slide (yes - adults too). There are different trails to explore. And if you are lucky you just might see Doug from",
          "My 9 year old grandson loved this area! A good way to run off excess energy. Plenty of areas for the adults to sit in the shade.",
          "a nice place to cool down and let the kids climb and run around. Watch the tire zip line - you hit the end and it jars pretty good. My youngest fell and hurt his face.",
          "My 6 year old daughter loved this trail. It really challenges kids and their agility abilities to figure out how to achieve. Be careful with really young kids crossing the rope areas. Russell and Dug (from \"Up\") are no longer here - totally bummed about that.",
          "My boys aged 7 & 10 had a blast in this section of the park. Completing the challenges on the map, riding the tyre swings, climbing through the rope bridges.",
          "Our boys are 6 and 8, this was their thing, a chance to run climb and let off some steam. They spent a good hour in this section of the park.",
          "In California Adventure Park, there is a fun outdoor adventure park - Redwood Creek Challenge Trail. There is a map that shows the different challenges one can do along the trail. Some of the many highlights include climbing the Cliff Hanger Traverse Rock Climb. One can also",
          "Redwood is a great place to take a break (parents) whilst the kids can climb, slide, run and zip-line. No waiting in line, shade and you can be in another world to disney for a short time.",
          "The course is so much fun. Love running up the rope net course to the observation tower and surveying California Adventure Park. We also just like walking through the trails. The landscaping is beautiful. If the kids aren't worn out from a day in the park already, this place",
          "Do you have active kids that get sick of waiting in lines and just need to run around and play? If so, This is the perfect attraction for you. My kids LOVE this maybe even more than they love the rides. Seriously! I have 5 kids ages 4-13 and the ALL beg to play in this adventure",
          "First time we found this place. It is like a park, give the kids a map and they have challenges to do. Then let them go (if they are old enough). They do the challenge and cross it off and get a sticker at the end - they loved it - we did this 4 times in a 5 day visit.",
          "My 2 year old loved having a chance to slide and run and play. My older ones (age 4 and 8) enjoyed the other activities, especially the rock wall and the large swing. It was a nice break from the standard rides (which we also love)",
          "This was a great idea. It gives kids of all ages a place to run, climb, side and burn extra energy. It is expecially nice if you have a child who gets overwhelmed or overexcited. They can just play while you sit and enjoy the scenery.",
          "Took my son this October and we had rode all the rides and the lines were too long. I didn't want to sit out in the hot day so we there and I let my son go and he had a blast going on the trail, bridges, climbing wall, zipline and seeing \"UP\" Doug character.",
          "Initially I thought this was just a play area, but it was so much more. My kids loved it and I was so happy that there was only one way to exit! The theming was great and it was a lot of fun for them.",
          "Located inside DCA, this is a fun area for children. At the entrance, a cast member offers a map of the area and the children can search for objects and check them off on the map. As well, there are physical challenges offered, like traversing a small climbing section and",
          "The Challenge Trail is a brilliant idea probably dreamed up after seeing so many tired parents following kids bursting with energy. The different activities of the trail (walking, climbing, ropes, etc.) are just the energy burners that kids love. It's safe also! ...",
          "My son had the best time achieving all of the badges and wanted to do some of them again and again! We were there for over an hour and he hardly slowed down the whole time. The ceremony is a lovely way to top it all off.",
          "This area in the California Adventure theme park was a welcome respite from running from ride to ride. It provided a unique experience for the kids and my 5-year-old \"finally\" got to go zip-lining",
          "Have been to California adventure at least 15 times and never went in this part before.. it as an interest neat area.. dont tell the kids but it is educational also lol Would totally go in there again next time we visit the park",
          "My 4yo granddaughter and I were looking for her mother and sister here. We had 2 boxes of popcorn and 2 Mickey head popcorn boxes. It was quite challenging to trek through the overhead netting carrying these items, but it was a ton of fun. My granddaughters had fun too. ;-)",
          "This area is probably best known as a place to let your kids burn off some excess energy but it's also a lovely, peaceful place to just sit and relax. Reminded me a bit of childhood vacations spent camping in the mountains",
          "This is a great place for parents with kids less than 10 to take a break during the day if the kids have more energy than you do. It is located in California Adventure in the Grizzly Peak section. There are a ton of things to climb on, jump through, and scramble over. There are",
          "Easy outdoor challenge for all ages, even adults. The Flying ox and climbing nets were the favourites. Follow your map and complete the challenges to get a sticker at the end. Easy challenges and you can go on it even if you don't ant to get a sticker at the end. Something",
          "I've never tried it but it looks fun. Probably something to do if you want to take a break from the rides (but who would)",
          "Nice play area to stretch your legs in the afternoon. We arrived to the park midday when all of the lines were peaking. This was a good option to get moving after sitting in the car. There are 6 different activities to complete to earn a badge (actually a sticker). Be",
          "This is the most amazing area for kids, our 5 year old grandson would happily stay here for hours with all the things they have to do- zip line, rock wall traversing, rope bridges- beyond amazing. Right inside Disneys Ca Adventure.",
          "Not just for kids! It's a beautiful escape to nature for all ages. Cool, relaxing stroll if you like, or enjoy the challenges.",
          "We didn't have the kids with us on this trip, but still wanted to check out this challenge trail. It's very well done and the kids there seemed to enjoy it. Climbing walls, zip lines, rope bridges and lots of other fun, active things to do. They can play on any areas of the",
          "My son absolutely loves this! He just turned 6 and he can't wait to go back! This is fun and engaging. Kids get a sense of accomplishment when they complete a challenge! The look of pride in their eyes is worth it to stop at this attraction!"

        "wiki": "Anaheim () is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th-most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second-largest city in Orange County in terms of land area, and is known for being the home of the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, and two major sports teams: the Anaheim Ducks ice hockey club and the Los Angeles Angels baseball team.\nAnaheim was founded by fifty German families in 1857 and incorporated as the second city in Los Angeles County on March 18, 1876; Orange County was split off from Los Angeles County in 1889. Anaheim remained largely an agricultural community until Disneyland opened in 1955. This led to the construction of several hotels and motels around the area, and residential districts in Anaheim soon followed. The city also developed into an industrial center, producing electronics, aircraft parts and canned fruit. Anaheim is a charter city.Anaheim's city limits extend almost the full width of Orange County, from Cypress in the west, twenty miles east to the Riverside County line in the east, encompass a diverse range of neighborhoods. In the west, mid-20th-century tract houses predominate. Downtown Anaheim has three mixed-use historic districts, the largest of which is the Anaheim Colony. South of downtown, a center of commercial activity of regional importance begins, the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city, which stretches east and south into the cities of Orange, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. This edge city includes the Disneyland Resort, with two theme parks, multiple hotels, and retail district; Disney is part of the larger Anaheim Resort district with numerous other hotels and retail complexes. The Platinum Triangle, a neo-urban redevelopment district surrounding Angel Stadium, which is planned to be populated with mixed-use streets and high-rises. Further east, Anaheim Canyon is an industrial district north of the Riverside Freeway and east of the Orange Freeway. The city's eastern third consists of Anaheim Hills, a community built to a master plan, and open land east of the 241 tollway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nAnaheim's name is a blend of Ana, after the nearby Santa Ana River, and German -heim meaning \"home\", which is also a common Germanic place name compound (compare Trondheim in Norway and many place names in Germany).The city of Anaheim was founded in 1857 by 50 German-Americans who were residents of San Francisco and whose families had originated in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Franconia in Bavaria.  After traveling through the state looking for a suitable area to grow grapes, the group decided to purchase a 1,165 acres (4.71 km2) parcel from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros' large Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana in present-day Orange County for $2 per acre.For $750 a share, the group formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company headed by George Hansen. Their new community was named Annaheim, meaning \"home by the Santa Anna River\" in German. The name later was altered to Anaheim. To the Spanish-speaking neighbors, the settlement was known as Campo Alem\u00e1n (English: German Field).\n\nAlthough grape and wine-making was their primary objective, the majority of the 50 settlers were mechanics, carpenters and craftsmen with no experience in wine-making. The community set aside 40 acres (16 ha) for a town center and a school was the first building erected there. The first home was built in 1857, the Anaheim Gazette newspaper was established in 1870 and a hotel in 1871. The census of 1870 reported a population of 565 for the Anaheim district. For 25 years, the area was the largest wine producer in California. However, in 1884, a disease infected the grape vines and by the following year the entire industry was destroyed. Other crops \u2013 walnuts, lemons and oranges \u2013 soon filled the void. Fruits and vegetables had become viable cash crops when the Los Angeles \u2013 Orange County region was connected to the continental railroad network in 1887.\n\n\n=== Helena Modjeska ===\nPolish actress Helena Modjeska settled in Anaheim with her husband and various friends, among them Henryk Sienkiewicz, Julian Sypniewski and \u0141ucjan Paprocki. While living in Anaheim, Helena Modjeska became good friends with Clementine Langenberger, the second wife of August Langenberger. Helena Street and Clementine Street are named after these two ladies, and the streets are located adjacent to each other as a symbol of the strong friendship which Helena Modjeska and Clementine Lagenberger shared. Modjeska Park in West Anaheim, is also named after Helena Modjeska.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Anaheim was a massive rural community dominated by orange groves and the landowners who farmed them. One of the landowners was Bennett Payne Baxter, who owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of Angel Stadium. He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners. He was not only successful, he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well. Ben Baxter and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community before the opening of Disneyland transformed the city. A street along Edison Park is named Baxter Street. Also during this time, Rudolph Boysen served as Anaheim's first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950. Boysen created a hybrid berry which Walter Knott later named the boysenberry, after Rudy Boysen. Boysen Park in East Anaheim was also named after him.\n\nIn 1924, Ku Klux Klan members were elected to the Anaheim City Council on a platform of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day. The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1200 members in Orange County. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were the majority of their opponents; however, the opposition to the Klan also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County who joined the Klan did so out of a sense of civic activism. Upon easily winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.The opposition to the KKK's hold on Anaheim politics organized, bribed a Klansman for their secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries, defeating most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed; its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.\n\n\n=== Disneyland and the late 20th century ===\n\nConstruction of the Disneyland theme park began on July 16, 1954, and it opened to the public on July 17, 1955. It has become one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, with over 650 million visitors since its opening. The location was formerly 160 acres (0.65 km2) of orange and walnut trees. Hotels and motels began to spread and residential districts soon followed. By the mid-1960s, the city's explosive growth would attract a Major League Baseball team, with the California Angels relocating from Los Angeles to Anaheim in 1966, where they have remained since. In 1980, the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams relocated from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the Angels' home field, Anaheim Stadium, playing there until their relocation to St. Louis in 1995. In 1993, Anaheim gained its own National Hockey League team when The Walt Disney Company founded the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. \nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported Anaheim's population as 9.3% Hispanic and 89.2% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Anaheim grew rapidly in population. Today, Anaheim has a diverse ethnic and racial composition.During the large expansion of the Disneyland Resort in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the city of Anaheim recognized the surrounding Anaheim Resort area as a tourist destination. It includes the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, the Honda Center, and Angel Stadium.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, Disney's California Adventure (renamed Disney California Adventure Park in 2010), the most expansive project in Disneyland's history, opened to the public. In 2007, Anaheim celebrated its sesquicentennial.In July 2012, political protests by Hispanic residents occurred following the fatal shooting of two men, the first of whom was unarmed. Protesting occurred in the area between State College and East Street, and was motivated by concerns over police brutality, gang activity, domination of the city by commercial interests, and a perceived lack of political representation of Hispanic residents in the city government. The protests were accompanied by looting of businesses and homes.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAnaheim is located at 33\u00b050\u203210\u2033N 117\u00b053\u203223\u2033W and is approximately 25 miles (40 km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The city roughly follows the east-to-west route of the 91 Freeway from the Orange-Riverside county border to Buena Park. To the north, Anaheim is bounded by Yorba Linda, Placentia, Fullerton, and Buena Park (from east to west). The city shares its western border with Buena Park and Cypress. Anaheim is bordered on the south by Stanton, Garden Grove, and Orange (from west to east). Various unincorporated areas of Orange County also abut the city, including Anaheim Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 50.8 square miles (132 km2), 49.8 square miles (129 km2) of which is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) of which (1.92%) is water.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city recognizes several districts, including the Anaheim Resort (the area surrounding Disneyland), Anaheim Canyon (an industrial area north of California State Route 91 and east of California State Route 57), and the Platinum Triangle (the area surrounding Angel Stadium). Anaheim Hills also maintains a distinct identity. The contiguous commercial development from the Disney Resort through into the cities of Orange, Garden Grove and Santa Ana has collectively been termed the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city.\n\n\n=== Communities and neighborhoods ===\n\nDowntown Anaheim is located in the heart of the Colony Historic District. Downtown is the administrative heart of the city where City Hall, Anaheim West Tower, Anaheim Police Headquarters, the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce and the Main Library are located. Anaheim Ice (formerly Disney Ice), the Downtown Anaheim Farmer's Market, a food hall in a historic 1919 Sunkist packing house, and the Center Street Promenade are also located in Downtown Anaheim. In late 2007, The Muzeo, the newest major museum in Orange County, opened its doors for the first time and is located next to Anaheim West Tower. Pearson Park is also located in Downtown Anaheim, and is named after Charles Pearson, who was Mayor of Anaheim during the time Walt Disney opened Disneyland in Anaheim. One of the major attractions located in Pearson Park is the Pearson Park Amphitheater. In the Colony Historic District just west of Downtown Anaheim is the Mother Colony House, which was built by George Hanson and was the first house built in Anaheim, the founder of Anaheim. Today, it is Anaheim's and Orange County's oldest extant museum. The Woelke-Stoeffel House is a Victorian mansion located next door to the Mother Colony House. Originally the Victorian Home was occupied by the Stoeffel family, early pioneer residents of Anaheim. The home served as headquarters for the local Red Cross until the early 1990s. In 2010\u20132011, the Woelke-Stoeffel house became refurnished and is now part of the Founder's Park complex. Founder's Park includes the Mother Colony house and a carriage house, which serves as a museum of Anaheim's agricultural history.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many other South Coast cities, Anaheim maintains a Subtropical Mediterranean climate Csa, enjoying warm winters and hot summers.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Anaheim had a population of 336,265.

Team spokesmen pointed out that from its inception, the Angels had been granted territorial rights by Major League Baseball to the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino in addition to Orange County. The new owner, Arturo Moreno, believed the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County. The \"of Anaheim\" was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that \"Anaheim\" be included in the team's name.\nMayor Curt Pringle and other city officials countered that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises, Inc., then the ownership group for the Angels. They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation, but provided very little revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball LP in Orange County Superior Court, and a jury trial was completed in early February 2006, resulting in a victory for the Angels franchise.\nAnaheim appealed the court decision with the California Court of Appeal in May 2006. The case was tied up in the Appeals Court for over two years. In December 2008, the Appeals Court upheld the February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of Angels Baseball. In January 2009, the Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case any further, bringing an end to the four-year legal dispute.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\nAnaheim was, at one point in time, one of the most politically conservative major cities in the United States. However, in recent years it has been moving leftward. According to the California Secretary of State, as of October 22, 2018, Anaheim has 141,549 registered voters. Of those, 58,411 (41.27%) are registered Democrats, 39,885 (28.18%) are registered Republicans, and 37,877 (26.76%) have declined to state a political party/are independents.\n\n\n=== City government ===\n\nUnder its city charter, Anaheim operates under a council-manager government. Legislative authority is vested in a city council of seven nonpartisan members, who hire a professional city manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The mayor serves as the presiding officer of the city council in a first among equals role. Under the city's term limits, an individual may serve a maximum of two terms as a city council member and two terms as the mayor.\nUp until 2014, all council seats were elected at large. Voters elected the mayor and four other members of the city council to serve four-year staggered terms. Elections for two council seats were held in years divisible by four while elections for the mayor and the two other council seats were elected during the intervening even-numbered years.\nIn response to protests and a California Voting Rights Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and several residents, the city placed two measures on the November 2014 ballot. Measure L proposed that council members be elected by district instead of at large. Measure M proposed to increase the number of council seats from five to seven. Both measures passed.The current city council consists of:\nMayor Harry Sidhu (since 2018)\nDenise Barnes, District 1 (since 2016)\nJordan Brandman, District 2 (since 2018)\nJose F. Moreno, District 3 (since 2016)\nLucille Kring, District 4 (since 2012)\nStephen Faessel, District 5 (since 2016)\nTrevor O'Neil, District 6 (since 2018)\n\n\n=== Federal, state and county representation ===\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Anaheim is split among three Congressional districts:\nCalifornia's  39th congressional district, represented by Democrat Gil Cisneros,\nCalifornia's  45th congressional district, represented by Democrat Katie Porter, and\nCalifornia's  46th congressional district, represented by Democrat Lou Correa.In the California State Senate, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  29th Senate District, represented by Republican Ling Ling Chang,\nthe  34th Senate District, represented by Democrat Tom Umberg, and\nthe  37th Senate District, represented by Republican John Moorlach.In the California State Assembly, Anaheim is split among three districts:\nthe  65th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Sharon Quirk-Silva,\nthe  68th Assembly District, represented by Republican Steven Choi, and\nthe  69th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Tom Daly.On the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Anaheim is divided between two districts, with Anaheim Hills lying in the 3rd District and the remainder of Anaheim lying in the 4th District:\n\n3rd, represented by Donald P.

Law enforcement is provided by the Anaheim Police Department. Ambulance service is provided by Care Ambulance Service.\n\n\n=== Anaheim Public Utilities ===\nAnaheim Public Utilities is the only municipal owned water and electric utility in Orange County, providing residential and business customers with water and electric services. The utility is regulated and governed locally by the City Council. A Public Utilities Board, made up of Anaheim residents, advises the City Council on major utility issues.Anaheim has decided to bury power lines along major transportation corridors, converting its electricity system for aesthetic and reliability reasons. To minimize the impact on customer bills, undergrounding is taking place slowly over a period of 50 years, funded by a 4% surcharge on electric bills.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nIn 2003, Anaheim reported nine murders; given its population, this rate was one-third of the national average. Reported rapes in the city are relatively uncommon as well, but have been increasing, along with the national average. Robbery (410 reported incidents) and aggravated assault (824 incidents) rank among the most frequent violent crimes in the city, though robbery rates are half of the national average, and aggravated assaults are 68% of the average. 1,971 burglaries were reported, as well as 6,708 thefts, 1,767 car thefts, and 654 car accidents. All three types of crime were below average. There were 43 cases of arson reported in 2003, 43% of the national average.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nAnaheim is served by seven public school districts:\n\nAnaheim is home to 74 public schools, of which 47 serve elementary students, nine are junior high schools, fourteen are high schools and three offer alternative education.\nPrivate schools in the city include Acaciawood Preparatory Academy, Cornelia Connelly High School, Fairmont Preparatory Academy, Servite High School and Zion Lutheran School (PS2-Grade 8).\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nAnaheim has three private universities: Anaheim University and Southern California Institute of Technology (SCIT), and Bristol University (BU) with its sport teams Bristol Bears.\nThe North Orange County Community College District and Rancho Santiago Community College District serve the community.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nAnaheim has eight public library branches.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nIn the main portion of the city (not including Anaheim Hills), the major surface streets running west\u2013east, starting with the northernmost, are Orangethorpe Avenue, La Palma Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Ball Road and Katella Avenue.

They include the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the Orange Freeway (SR 57), and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). The Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), and the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 241) also have short stretches within the city limits. Also, SR 90 and SR 39 run through the city as regular streets.\nAnaheim is served by two major railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway. In addition, the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), a major regional transit station near Honda Center and Angel Stadium, serves Amtrak, Metrolink, and several bus operators, and the Anaheim Canyon Metrolink station serves Metrolink's IEOC Line. ARTIC is a proposed stop on the proposed California High-Speed Rail network.The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) provides bus service for Anaheim with local and county-wide routes, and both OCTA and Los Angeles County Metro operate bus routes connecting Anaheim to Los Angeles County. Also, Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) provides local shuttle service in and around the Anaheim Resort area, serving local hotels, tourist attractions, and the Disneyland Resort. Disney GOALS operates daily free bus service for low-income youth in the central Anaheim area. A proposal for streetcar service along Harbor Boulevard was rejected in 2018.\nAnaheim is equidistant from John Wayne Airport and Long Beach Airport (15 miles), but is also accessible from nearby Los Angeles International (30 miles), and Ontario (35 miles) airports.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAnaheim has the following sister cities:\n\nMito, Japan\nVitoria-Gasteiz, Spain\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of California\nList of cities and towns in California\nList of museums in Orange County, California\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAnaheim Historical Society\nAnaheim, California on the C-SPAN Cities Tour website",

          "This is one of the older kids, found in California Adventure Park. Themed around the Cars movies. Fast paced ride in an open top car along a track. Good fun. Make sure you fast pass it as the lines are always crazy.",

          "This is one of the greatest theme park rides Disney has ever created, and if you love the \"Cars\" movies and characters, you will absolutely love it. This is a fully realized world where Lightning McQueen, Mater, and the rest live. It's very similar to the Test Track ride at",

          "This ride is based on the cartoon movie Cars. We got a fast pass so there was only a five minute wait before we boarded our car. The race was the exciting part of the ride. This is good fun for young and old.",
          "Radiator Springs is so well themed. As good as anything. The Racer ride tells a great story, lasts a long time, has thrills and great views. It\u2019s like taking a cruise on Route 66 and then getting into some hi jinx.",

          "We really enjoyed Radiator Springs, but so glad we used a Fast Pass, as the lines were huge! It's like Test Track in WDW, perhaps a little slower, but with great Cars theming. It seemed the way to do it without a Fast Pass, was the Single Rider line.",
          "Awesome ride. The most \"Disney\" style ride in California Adventure. Fun ride with a story to go with it. A cruise down Route 66, through Radiator Springs, ending in a race. See all your favorite Cars characters. The only downside is that it is so popular be prepared for long",
          "Was gonna give this 4 then remembered the detail in it and had to go 5. The ride itself is not that thrilling (or rather I thought it may be), but the attention to detail is amazing and second to none. Do it for that alone of a fan of the movie. It\u2019s brilliant for that.",

          "I\u2019ve never seen the Cars movies so a lot of the movie references were lost on me until my daughter explained them. I might just see the movies now! The ride is fantastic. Reflecting the movies the ride starts sedately, picks up speed, and you get a super-condensed version of the",
          "The one ride I REALLY wanted to go on at California Adventure and I was lucky enough to get a ride (finally). The ride broke down multiple times on the day I visited but I was lucky enough to be there for the 10 minutes between one break down and the next and get a full ride.",

          "One of Disney's gems. They have recreated the desert racing enviroment and radiator springs from the Cars films brilliantly. Once you get in your car you head into the hills till you get to radiator springs where you get to meet all the great characters, giving you instructions",
          "We were lucky enough to walk into California adventure and a couple was leaving and gave us their fast pass for the ride so literally walked directly on to the ride!!! I never have been on it before my wife had been ..... We get on the and got the part were you race to the",

          "The recreation of the desert southwest done for this ride is fascinating. Love the representation of Yosemite Falls and this is my fav ride in all Disney parks. Not too fast and I know where the photo is taken so usually can time a fun-filled pic of myself for a great memory",
          "I did radiator springs and it was a really cute ride. You get in a car and then go through the story of Cars. Then you get put next to another car and \"race\" them. When I did it, the ride broke down and I got stuck for 45 minutes. Then the \"Oh no, the ride broke down\" recording",
          "Radiator Springs is one of the best rides at Disney's California Adventure. You get in a car and go through the story of Cars. Then you are next to another car and race them over hills and around curves. There's is a souvenir photo near the end of the ride. After the souvenir",
          "Go early and grab the fast pass for this. Easily the best ride in dca. Cars theme is lovely. Suitable for all ages as it isn't very scary. The only downside is really the long wait",
          "Our boys loved this ride and \"racing\" on the track. Cars' Land was probably one of their favorite spots. Lots of neat things to see along the way to remind them of the movie. We would highly recommend this especially for families with young boys!!",
          "This ride really reminds me of Test Track at the Florida Park Epcot. However, it is way more fun. The use of the characters is really fun and it's really cool to get up close to the cars characters. The one in Florida doesn't have any sort of characterization. This has some very",
          "We had an awesome experience in Dec and loved the Christmas theme throughout California Adventure Park. Definitely go again!!!",
          "The ride was awesome but several things really missed me off. First they stopped doing fast pass at 1pm then we went on ride it said wait time was 60 minutes well that was a lie a big fat lie. It took 2 hrs 10 mins I clocked it. Then I got to where fast pass meets and I see",
          "Definitely had fun, but ride was broken down 5 times in a 3 day visit. The Fastpasses were for at least 6 hours later and were usually done by 2pm each day. 2 to 2.5 hour lines were the norm, so dont even try without a FastPass. Much preferred Soarin around the World and Grizzly",
          "This ride is incredible! But if you don't want to wait in long queues, get a FASTPASS first up! The FASTPASS distribution point is near the Bug's Life Land... so don't waste your time walking all the way to the ride to get one! This ride is really worth it, the best ride in",

          "We went here the first day we arrived on my son's birthday. The ticket counter gave us a free superpass for him for this ride since it was his #1 choice. We were able to get into the FastPass line up - the guy said about a 20 minute wait however it was only 10 mins! We were able",
          "Jaw-dropping detail and imagination - this is the finest \"dark ride\" / E Ticket attraction in the entire park! All of your favorite characters from the film are larger than life and perfect in every detail. And hold onto something 'cause this ride delivers thrills and highspeed",
          "this ride is actually in California Adventure portion of the theme-park. I have never been in the car that has won the race.... That being said, this is a fantastic roller-coaster type ride, that takes you through the movie the settings of the movie CARS. Upon entering the park",
          "Do not miss this ride! It is like you are actually in the movie. It is incredibly well done and apparently when they opened Cars Land they brought in the team who made the movie and they cried because it is so amazing! Be sure to go straight to this ride as soon as the park",
          "Fast passes for this ride are usually gone right away so we decided just to wait for the ride. It was a 50 minute wait, which was actually short compared to most times. It was worth the wait. It starts off as a tour through radiator springs then speeds up to you being in the",
          "This was our first time on the ride. It was amazing. Like others have stated it puts you into the Cars movie with the characters. Love how it is a mixture of the classic Fantasy land rides with a story then some excitement added on. Definitely get your Fast pass for the ride",
          "This is a great ride. I would suggest you get fast pass for this ride as you can wait up to 3 hours to get on when it's busy. Great for kids young and young at heart. Who doesn't love cars. Highly recommend even if you can't get fast pass I would still line up for it",
          "I can not get my mother off of this ride!! It's a great family ride where you feel like you're in the movie. The detail is incredible but if you are a visual person you could spend all day in this area.",
          "Throwing you into the cars film, you sit in a car and work your way through the story line. At the end you line up against another car and race side by side in a rollercoaster style ride. My only gripe is the build up section of the ride is too long and the racing section too",
          "This is a ride where a car races with another car. It is so fun. It goes a little fast. If you have seen the cars movie, it makes it that much better.",
          "Great even for my 4 year old ... the scenes on the ride are awesome... line is usually very long try to get a fast pass for this ride to make line tolerable especially if you have little one.",
          "This is a great ride, not too 'thrilling' but a lot of fun none the less. The ride starts fairly calm but after the 'white walling' of the wheels it gets a little faster, you race one of the other cars on the ride. Speeds get upto about 40mph which isn't that fast but a lot of",
          "Ok we went for the FIRST TIME this month. Loved loved LOVED the ride along with the town created leading up to the ride. Great job Disney!! The lines are very long...and in the heat it's not fun. Be sure you have water and snacks for the kids and an extra person in line in",
          "This ride is incredible. I love that it isn't just a summary of the movie we all love. You get to ride in a car and take a tour of Radiator Springs and see all of your favorite characters. Then, you are prepped for your race and sent zooming over a few hills and around the",
          "My family and I loved this ride! It had just enough thrill to be thrilling but not too scary for the littles. It's a beautiful ride for a beautiful movie! Loved it!",
          "If you come during summer months always get a fast pass the second you come in the park if not you will be waiting hours and with little ones that is no fun...during the cooler months you may still have a bit of a wait but not over 2 hours....have fun and enjoy the ride!!!!!",
          "This is similar to the test track ride at Epcot in Florida but way cooler due to the theming. Disney has recreated Radiator Springs from the movie and you have the opportunity to race another car. The lines can get long in the afternoon so get there early and/or use fast",
          "This was an awesome ride! Similar to Test Track, but very themed and fun. You race another car around a track with banks and curves. So much fun! Worth the wait!",
          "If you've been to Epcot and gotten on Test track and liked it, then you will like this. The ride is very cool. Our 5 year old godchild lived it too. It does have some speed but very doable for the faint of heart. We got on during the day and then at night. It was fantastic",

          "This should be at the top of one's list when visiting DCA. We were careful to secure a FastPass for each of us so that we could enjoy this ride after dinner at Carthay Circle. If I had been able to do so, I would have secured a second FP just to enjoy this wonderful ride. The",

          "This was at the top of our list to try when we visited the Disneyland Resort last month. We are big Cars fans, and from what we had seen online this ride looked like it was going to be great. Disney did a great job with the decor of this ride, it actually feels like you are in",

          "Funky cone food, but kids like it that way. Cars land is one of the busiest and slowest lines. Buy a Max pass.",
          "My absolute favorite part of the park! Both of our children really enjoyed Radiator Springs Racers this time and I love hanging out in Cars Land and just soaking up all of the beautiful lights at night. They did such a wonderful job creating this park and I really think it captures the spirit of the movie.",
          "I truly like the attention to detail in this land, the characters are so cute and some of my favorites, however the main attraction breaks down constantly, the fast pass return time can be 8 hours away, I got one at 11 am one time and the \u2026",
          "Outstanding. I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya man, every third blink is slower.",
          "This is a great addition to the park, good for all ages!",
          "Amazing work bringing Radiator Springs to life!",
          "The 2019 food and wine festival was a pretty cool event.   We bought the sip and savor pass for $50 and got 8 tabs which is any 8 items at the F&W carts (non alcoholic). Some of the best food for the tab is a hidden away area by goofy' s sky coaster.",
          "Extremely cute attraction! Absolutely loved it!",
          "Loved this place, recently went and was totally blown away by the attention to detail. The radiator springs racers was one of the e top 3 rides i went on. Loved the cozy cone got the bacon Mac and cheese in a pretzel cone... Best thing EVER enjoyed this place so much definitely going back.",
          "So much fun and immersive. The detail into making it look like films is incredible. The atmosphere and music playing are great. Radiator Springs Racers is one of the best rides in Disney California Adventure, great for everyone in the \u2026",
          "Great area for the whole family only a few rides but all are great and provides great theming.",
          "Like being in Radiator Springs in real life. My boys lost their minds.",
          "Cars Land is so pretty at night! I mean it's nice during the day, but st night they turn on all the neon lights and the Radiator Springs Racers is so much more fun, at least in my opinion! Plus the single rider lane definitely helps out a lot for that particular ride :)",
          "A very witty and enjoyable experience. The area is much more spacious than other parts of either park, and I like that you don't feel so crowded. Some of the rides here are certainly not worth waiting in line, and the good rides have way too long of lines, but in general, this part of the park is pretty enjoyable overall.",
          "Wait time is outrageous. Fun to go at least once.",
          "A must see! Visited for 1 day with a toddler. Found it was enough time. Dl Disney app and get to all the rides in cars land. Use FASTPASS for main cars ride",
          "One on our favorite rides. Long lines though bring your patience.",
          "Didn't know you could review this out of California Adventure, but this was definitely my favorite part. Lines are very long though. Happy to find they serve pickles. The big driving car ride is the best. My favorite RIDE of all time. Going \u2026",
          "Cars land is a wonderfully thought out place that is a must do when we come to California Adventure.  The main attraction, Radiator Springs Racers, is a blast.  It is very popular so expect to wait a while otherwise invest in a fast pass to \u2026",
          "The stand-out area of California Adventure (as of 2019). It still doesn't entirely capture the immersion that Disneyland does, but it's a good time. Some of the best food and a really fun environment.\n\nI would highly recommend going at night- that's when the neon signs light up, the mountains glow red, and it becomes magical.",
          "5 stars, just how I like my bubble hash rated",
          "Was the best ride to get on the cars are so fast and we won the race",
          "My favorite attraction is Radiator Springs Racers",
          "One of the most magical additions to Disney Parks. Make sure you make a visit there in the day and at night. The daytime to enjoy the landscapes and waterfall, the night time to experience a full recreation of the film! The neon lights and music help you feel like you've walked onto the screen come to life!",
          "I wang to go here",
          "loved it. Kids did too",
          "Really fun! Nice variety of food and shops, as well.\n\nWarning: It's EXTREMELY hard to get fast passes for the cars ride (radiator springs racers), though, so make sure you get into the park early to reserve them. Otherwise you're looking at a wait of 2 hours on average for the standby line.",
          "It's like if I was in the actual Cars movie. Loved it!!",
          "Loved, loved, loved!!  Best land there. 5*",
          "So much fun. If you do the fast pass, either through the fast pass area or with the Max Pass on the Disneyland app, it definitely saves you a lot of waiting time. That's because this is a very popular ride. When we were there, the standby \u2026",
          "My favorite part of Disney California Adventure!! Great rides and you feel like you are on the movie!!",
          "I was very impressed with what Disney had put together here! It is a real life version of radiator springs and it is absolutely breathtaking! You and your family can feel like you are in the movie while you walk down Route 66 and grab a bite at \"Flo's cafe\" I highly recommend the hamburgers!",
          "By far one of the best things in all the Disney parks. Cars land is SO immersive and totally beautiful - day and night - so make sure to visit at both times! The cars ride around radiator springs and all the spots from the film come to life perfectly. Racers is the best ride in the park so don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Cars Land is my favorite part of California Adventure! It\u2019s exactly like in the movie! Down to every detail! It really feels like you\u2019ve stepped into Radiator Springs and the movie has come to life. All three rides are really cute and I \u2026",
          "Wow, what an experience! If you want to get the feeling like you are in the movie Cars, come here. Walk down the main Street in Radiator Springs and visit all the sites.  There are plenty of things to see and do. Make sure to get here early though as it is a popular place!",
          "It is an perfect recreation of the Radiator Springs. I really enjoyed my time here!",
          "Really had a great time here.cars line was way to long . Silly rides like mater's was super fun. Alcohol can be found if you look hard enough.",
          "More for boys then the little girls. Overall the place is laid out to move people towards the cars race track.",
          "Cars Land was built very well, and a very good reproduction of what it looks like in the films. \nThis was great for our kids, it did rain on 2 of the 4 days we visited the parks, so a bunch of the rides weren't open. It finally dried up in \u2026",
          "Pretty small area that focuses on the Cars theme. Can't remember all the attraction names, but the racing one around the canyon is definitely a fan favourite. There's a casual children's ride across the way with dancing Italian music & an automated McQueen mascot that has to be monitored through the area.",
          "This land is always adorable but especially when they decorate for holidays.",
          "The only way to truly enjoy cars land is to wisely use fast passes. Kids love to visit cars land and to ride the rides, but there are no rides in the park worth standing in line for 120+ minutes. So if you go, get a fast pass.",
          "Really had a special holiday visit to California Adventure. Cars Land is unique to walk through at night. Look at the subtle cars themed holiday decorations. The path from Pacific Wharf eateries past Radiator Springs Racers and Flo's V8 \u2026",
          "Luigi has the best prices and inventory of white walls...love the new look!",
          "It is always busy and in the morning is more easy to get but afternoon\u2019s is too busy one hour is for sure to wait and after that is depend on your luck.",
          "Great experience! Love it",
          "Highly recommend stopping by Radiator Springs Racers and riding as a single rider! Much less of a wait! Definitely stop by in the evening when all of the neon has been turned on, it truly feels like you are in the movie as your walking down \"route 66\"",
          "Our experience was exceptional!!! My Wife got the fast passes for us and our daughters, we waited less than 10 minutes to get in and I can't say enough!!!\nMy family loved it!!!\nOne of our favorite rides!",
          "This place has so much fun. There is a lot more to do here than you would expect. There's always great food and drinks here that's one of my favorite aspects. Awesome rides and experiences to have here",
          "Great experience. So much to do and see.\n\nAs of right now there's about 7,000 reviews so let me just say this. This was the first location that I felt like I was actually IN the movie. They designed this park to look exactly like radiator \u2026",
          "I told my wife I didn't think it would be that much fun to go to this part, well I was wrong. So much fun, and you have to ride the cars.  If your kids love Mater or Lightning McQueen, they will go crazy here.  We ate lunch at Flo's, I love how the movie comes to life at this part of the park.  Must see even for adults, really.",
          "Smaller than I expected, but lots of fun. Attenti6 to detail is outstanding",
          "Good for pictures but nothing more",
          "The details that were put into recreating Radiator Springs is absolutely stunning. They even have actual car versions of the characters that drive around and meet guests. If you really want to enjoy it, make sure you go by this area once \u2026",
          "We were very impressed by California Adventure. We have visited several attractions throughout the country and this was impressive. We greatly enjoyed the Cars exhibit. It looked just like Radiator Springs. Bugs Life and the Tower of Terror \u2026",
          "This land is a blast!  The Radiator Springs Racers is the best thing here for sure!",
          "Flo's is great, love the tuna fish!  Very little kid focused, without a fast pass or going single rider cars is too long of a wait still years after opening. I still like it as a single rider though",
          "It was fast and fun!! I highly recommend the single rider line if everyone in your party can \"ride alone.\" There were 2 of us and we got on the same car.",
          "Oh man, we could ride Mater's Junkyard Jamboree over and over and a hundred times in a row. We love that ride so much. All of Cars Land is great. I don't know what they can come up with to make it better, but I know they will. These Imagineers are unstoppable.",
          "Love the ambience of the place especially at night.",
          "It would be great if it wasn't so crowded. People don't know where or how to walk with other people around. They are in their own little world.",
          "Cars Land was awesome, looks like the movie almost to a T. The town truly comes to life when the neon lights come on at night! The street light even blinks slower on the 3rd blink. Awesome experience and time spent!",
          "This place is awesome. If you e watched cars enough times you'll understand this place makes you feel as I'd your in the actual town from Cars, Radiator Springs. The rides can be great for the little ones although the main ride tthere is \u2026",
          "Pretty small and poor food selection but all and all pretty cool setup. Very much like the movies. Radiator sprints was legit. Def get the fast pass as the line gets crazy long... Even on days where most likes are sub 30... This was 1.5-2 hours without the fast pass.",
          "ok. just lookin with s friend. I prefer Carmax...& they offer reliable cars & inexpensive warranties.",
          "This place is super cool.  It looks just like the movie!  Flo's is a restaurant,  Luigi's is a fun kid ride, Sarges shop is a store and then st the end of the road you have the cars racer ride.  This is a lot of fun.  It is a really modern ride that will amaze!  Single rider option is available which speeds up the long lines!",
          "The best attraction at DCA hands down. It actually feels like you've jumped into the cars movie and are visiting the actual radiator springs. My kids absolutely loved it. \n\nIf you want to get on the radiator springs racers ride you \u2026",
          "The new cars land literally makes you feel like they have set you down in radiator springs from the cars movie.  The cars ride is awesome, but the line is long and fast passes go fast so head over first thing and get your pass.  The other rides are very little kid friendly, but still fun for the older kids.",
          "This is a fantastic ride. Perfect for kids of all ages. Slow at first and then gets faster but not too fast. Travels through the world of the movie Cars. It's like your in the movie and then you get to race. \nI highly recommend this ride to everyone. Just go have fun, and you'll love it.",
          "Our family of 5 had a 5 day park hopper ticket and spent 2 of these days at California Adventure Park. With more roller coasters and 'scary' rides than Disneyland it was a different experience that everyone loved. We had booked the meal \u2026",
          "This new little land is fun for all ages.  Get the fast past for the Radiator Springs ride first thing when you get there or it's a 2 hour wait usually.  Great ride though.",
          "The most exciting theme park in Disney, from the rides to the overall appearance of the attractions! So much to do...to see...you need more than one day to see all that Cars Land has to offer! The only downside to the park is there aren't enough choices/ places to dine.",
          "Incredible replica of Radiator Springs from the Cars movies. Attention to detail is amazing. We were hoping more of the Cars characters would be around but we only saw Lightning McQueen one day and there was a long line of kids waiting to \u2026",
          "Cars land is the highlight of Disney California Adventure. It has a great atmosphere and the cars ride is a great race experience. I recommend it. Looking forward to going back once marvel zone opens.",
          "This place is awesome in so many ways, and has one of the best theme park rides of the park.",
          "Disney did a really good job creating this land. The details make you feel like it's a different land and no longer in anaheim, ca. Almost all the rides are great and you can even meet and dance with some of your favorite car characters!",
          "amazing,  like stepping foot into the movie. Love getting food/ snacks at the Cozy Cone too.",
          "Such a cool area! This place looks exactly like the movie! It's hard not to get caught up in it",
          "Not joking wait til sunset for us it was 530 and you'll hear that \"life is a dream song\" and all the lights will turn on and it's magical. So fun and charming but you can't do the main ride without a fast pass the line is 2 hours long on average. Definitely worth a fast pass use.",
          "Really fun!!! If you want the cars max pass you really gotta hurry because they sell out fast! It's super cute and very family friendly",
          "Cars ride is a must!  Originally thought it would have been something made for kids but like the movie it was fun for all ages. Stepping into radiator springs really set the mood and was amazing to see the town from the movie",
          "Great re-creation of the street in the movie.  It's especially captivating in the evening with all the colorful lighting. Eating at Flo's Diner is a lot of fun. And the rides in Cars Land are fun for the whole family.  But get a Fast Pass or Max Pass for the racers - don't stand in line for hours.",
          "One of the best lands Disney has made. Incredible immersion, theming, and E ticket ride.",
          "There are only 2 rides in Cars Land... The wait time for us was nearly 3 hours! The rides were fun but most of this part of the park is shopping and items to eat. My child is a fan of these characters... So we always have to stop here.",
          "Really fun. Loved the details in the theming and it had our favorite ride in the park as well as a couple of other rides that were great for all ages.",
          "Decorated for Christmas is so neat. They don't miss any details. I loved walking down the street looking at all the well thought out lights and decor. We love meeting up with the Cars characters as well.",
          "I dont come to Disneyland  since its overly expensive , long lines and sometimes just rude people,  HOWEVER The Woody Show had their takeover event and Disney closed down California Adventure to the public and only people who won tickets \u2026",
          "Great ride!! If done at dusk it really does feel like your crusing in the car. Lines can be long but still worth it. Loved the race at the end.",
          "Best place for my son. Lovely decor",
          "Wonderful land at DCA",
          "We had fun walking around the realistic replica of Radiator Springs. They have a lot of fun rides and place to eat at or buy souvenirs. This is a must see if you're in California Adventure!",
          "This place was something else! It was amazing! I was so blown away by the details and how life like everything looked. I honestly felt like I was an extra in the actual Cars movie! Thank you for making my 1st experience super special Disney!!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c",
          "Cars is such a fun ride! It's like 2 rides in one (scenic ride & rollercoaster). I now understand why the ride-time lines are so long, so I recommend getting the Max Pass on your phone like we did.",
          "Just like the movie. The main ride is so fun and can go single rider to get more rides in.",
          "Fun ride. Usually one of longest lines so get fast pass",
          "Walking through the park makes you feel like a kid again.  Everything in the park is designed to make you think your taking a stroll through  a Pixar movie.  Keep up the good work.",
          "A perfect recreation of the film I grew up watching, seeing the rockwork in the background as the enter is one the most impressive moments I had in a theme park.",
          "Radiator Springs Racers was SO much fun but we waiting in line for almost 2 hours. I definitely will never ride that ride again without a fast pass!",
          "This was heaven for my kids. This was a great experience and felt like we were in the movie with all the attention to detail that was put into this place.",
          "Fun place for everyone.",
          "One of the best themed, immersive lands in Disney Parks history. The rich, highly detailed environment is whimiscal and transports you to another world.",
          "Lots of fun! Max pass is well worth it especially if you want to ride the Cars ride. The ride is worth the max pass alone since the line never got below 2 hrs.",
          "Best ride to be stuck on",
          "The land is great, a must for first timers. Get your fast pass to the racers early,  Parents swap is also a great option. Food is great, flos cafe, reasonable.",
          "Cars land is a great place to spend time with smaller children, since all but one of the rides are good for all ages, and their are a lot of options to stop for a snack. The iconic cozy-cone motel is located in this area, serving the \u2026",
          "I hated the cars movie but this ride is sooo fun! One of my all time favorites",
          "It is like being in the Cars movie.   The racer ride is well done.  A lot of detail.  The two kids rides are okay.  My 2 year old grand daughter liked the dancing cars ride.",
          "Get there early, the cars ride is popular and the lines get long quick, but its a great attraction, especially if you're a fan of the movie, or a fan of cartoons.....youll feel like youre in one.",
          "I forgot we were at Disneyland because everything was themed and placed perfectly! Great rides and just a fun atmosphere!! Make sure you find the cars characters to interact with \ud83d\ude01",
          "Cars Land is great! It literally steps you into the movie, everything is in its place. And yes, you can even meet Lighting McQueen and Mater among with other cars throughout the year! \nDon't forget to check it out around dusk when the \u2026",
          "One of the best places at California adventure",
          "Cars land was amazing! We started here and then hurried to come back and the end of it stay because we loved it so much. And, if you don't mind riding in separate cars on radiator springs racers, the single rider line goes real quick! Also, do it at night!",
          "The main street was fun if your kids like the Cars movies. The walk through the desert part was our favourite part. We ate at the petrol station cafe and the food was very ordinary, don't eat there. Unfortunately the main Cars ride was \u2026",
          "Just be prepared for very long lines.  Even with the flex pass the cars ride at times had over an hour wait.  The ride at one point for general line was over 160 minutes of standing in line.  Most of ride times were 80 to 120 minutes until \u2026",
          "This is a ride you have to run and get the fast pass as soon as you get in to the park! The fast passes are usually gone by noon for the entire day! I really love this ride it\u2019s always fast and fun and we enjoy the entertaining part in the beginning plus the base at the end hope you enjoy our little video!!",
          "Aesthetic in cars land is eye catching and immersive. The rides are mostly meant for younger children, but fun can still be had for the whole family. There are a couple restaurants in cars land but there is mostly snack, dessert, and drink \u2026",
          "Great place to visit you favorite character from the Cars Movie. A must enjoy area for the family.",
          "Love Cars Land!! Love my Disney days!! Cars ride is awesome!!",
          "Beautiful at night and is a solid recreation of Radiator Springs.  Get a Fastpass or go in the Single-Rider line for Radiator Springs Racers.  The regular line for that ride can have wait times bordering on 2 hours even on non-peak crowd days.",
          "I love all things Disney",
          "Line management is horrible!  We have been standing in the \"stand by\" line for well over an hour.  When we entered, they said the wait was 60 mins... only half way there!  Time has increased from 60 to 80 minutes then to 135 minutes just \u2026",
          "This is my favorite land in California Adventure. I never get tired walking down the street and feeling just like I stepped right into the first Cars movie. If you are visiting Cars Land for the first time, then I recommend you plan to ride \u2026",
          "Disney has definitely outdone itself with Cars Land. The scenery and the ride is like stepping into the movie itself. I can not tell you how many times I would take my nieces and nephews and they would be excited to feel like they were part \u2026",
          "This was one of the biggest changes from the last time we were at California Adventure, and it is worth going. Get there early if you want to go on the radiator springs racers ride. It is a lot of fun, but when we were there, it was always \u2026",
          "Cars land is awesome. Some of my favorite rides are in this land. If you get chance (it closes during rain) ride Luigi's. It's such a fun simple ride that even Grandma can enjoy. This place can get a little crowded as there's kinda one main attraction at the end of the road and several smaller ones along the path.",
          "Absolutely stunning how much detail was put into that ride! The ride is fun and the scenery  is mind-blowing! Just more Magic everywhere you go.",
          "Most popular attraction (as usual).  It is fun for people all ages.  The line builds up quickly, so hop on early or get a fast pass before they are all taken. \n\nWait times start off around 20minutes upon park opening and can easily exceed 120 minutes (have seen it at 135 a few times).",
          "The wait times are ridiculous. Fast pass books out within an hour or two of being open. Then waiting in line is over 2 hours. Last time it took us about 2:45 to get through. Even when we got close to the front the fast pass people get priority so the line almost never moves.",
          "Get a fast pass as soon as you can. This line is looonnngggg. Fun once you get there though",
          "Fun little place of the Cars land and quick lines ranging from 25-30 min. Very fun and nice shops. The cozy cones eating area has great foods to choose from!",
          "Really fun. i reccomend going on the Radiator Springs Racers ride first because it is the longest wait. Right from opening, it can go into a half hour wait.",
          "Long lines but very cool to go. Looking around is the 80% of going to Disneyland and California. I loved going through the rides with my family.",
          "Always busy. Try to get a fast pass for most of the rides. The cozy cone has some really good snacks and treats.",
          "Really busy but really fun. The kids will love \"Tow Maters Jukebox Jamboree\" for many reasons. Hope this helps.",
          "Such attention to detail! Food at Flo's was wonderful! Line ups weren't bad. Went on rides all day! \nLove love love Mator",
          "This is by far my favorite land at California Adventure. From the 60's tunes at Flo's to mac and cheese cones at the Cozy Cone. Although if you really want to see something magical, wait  until just before sunset to see the town light up.",
          "Very fun land, be ready for a long wait for the racecar ride though. Advise fast passes or single person ride",
          "Absolutely recommended\n\nEnjoy the race",
          "The attention to detail and overall experience is stellar. Alot of people miss out on the magic in California Adventure. But make no mistake it is just as memorable and magical as Disneyland. Always a great time at the Disneyland Resort.",
          "One of the better attractions. Worth the wait for the ride. The visuals are stunning",
          "The Cars attraction is a must! We had so much fun!! Yesterday, was my first time and this ride plus the Guardian of the Galaxy was SUPER!",
          "Such amazing attention to detail. Disney does it again",
          "Seriously my kids favorite ride is in cars land. Love all the different characters that you are able to get your picture taken with. Love the creativity.",
          "The movie experience comes alive when you walk through here. Feels so much like in the movie.",
          "Love the Mac and cheese cones",
          "Always have the best time here. I love the scenery and the atmosphere. Awesome!",
          "Always so fun to ride, and you can always here the fun screams coming from the ride. It never gets old to ride on.",
          "Radiator springs had a 45 min wait with fast pass over Xmas holidays.  Confusing where to line up with fast pass, need better signage.  Ride was fun.  I felt genuinely sorry for the poor dudes waiting 3-4 hrs without a fast pass.",
          "Awesome ride! A must do when you're in Disneyland",
          "Wait time for some of these rides in cars land was insane. 200+ min wait time for the cars ride on a Tuesday!  Experience is one of a kind but make sure to take some snacks.",
          "Great, fun place!!! Get fast pass for Radiator Springs racers totally worth it. If you are a single rider take advantage of faster access",
          "My favorite place in the California park. Halloween is absolutely amazing. I can't wait to see it at Christmas time:)",
          "A charming representation of Radiator Springs. Incredible attention to detail, many clever food options at all price points. 3 rides, typically a longer wait than the rest of the kids rides at DCA.",
          "LOVE this area of Disneyland. The main attraction is the racers of course which are worth the long wait. I advise a fast pass if possible. Lots to look at while waiting in line. Try holding a light to the glass bottles of the oil house. See this area at night for a truly beautiful experience. The neon is fab.",
          "One of the best rides in California adventure is hands down. No complaints here... well maybe besides the line but not a whole lot can be done about that. Big fan!!",

          "Wonderful mix of Disney magic and fun rides. One of the best areas in the park. Radiator springs cars ride in the back is the best. Maybe even the most fun in the whole park. This was just so fun. Go early or with a fast pass. Waits can get crazy long.",
          "My favorite place in Disneyland California Adventure! My son and I always have lunch at Flo's Cafe and spend time just walking around. I swear we discovered something new every single visit. Obviously, all the rides are a must do EVERY visit!",

          "All time best best place to be at Disneyland.",
          "Grew up going to Disney World. Just visited Disneyland for the first time. The Halloween decorations in Cars Land are top notch. Radiator Springs Racers blew my mind, so beautiful. Cars Land is a main reason for wishing to go back.",

          "What can i say? This part of California Adventure is an exact replica of what you find in the Cars movies. Look just like it. Very fun, happy atmosphere and the ride was so fun. Just be aware that the wait could be up to 2 hours. Otherwise, this was my favorite thing about the Disney and i am already missing it. I need to go back.",

          "Very fun ride just to long of a wait in line 3hrs too long. Then they should not give out so many fast passes for the same hour. Its not fair for those who wait in line. That causes a longer wait because they pass about 40 people with fast pass and like 1 or 2 family groups. NOT FAIR!!",

          "Flo's has the best breakfast in California Adventure. Try the breakfast chicken tamale!",
          "Radiator racers kept breaking down. Wait time was almost 3 hours. They let 43 fast pass through and Three from standby. Not fair.",
          "THE MAC AND CHEESE BREAD CONES ARE SO GOOD and this lart of the park is mesmerizing and gorgeous at night. So many neon lights and the cars race ride looks like the real Arizona.",
          "Kids had a great time.",
          "Love Cars Land especially Radiator Springs Racers!!! Definitely one of my favorites!!! Try to get the fastpass for this ride first because lines are always crazy. 90 min wait on average but still worth it",
          "Love all the rides in cars land and great food.",
          "The best ride in California adventure! Must fastpass on this one. The wait times in Disneyland are insane!!!! A family of 5 without a fastpass can get on maybe 3 rides in a day. A family of 5 with a fastpass can get on 6 rides in a day. But the parks are crazy overcrowded.",
          "Love Cars Land.  One of the best part of Disneyland.  One of the best areas and rides.",
          "Loved Radiator Springs racers. What a fun ride. Also was very nice to meet you granddaughter,who was scared of the faster rides and even got her and my other grandkids a couple of buttons. Thank you,Aldo for your customer service and care.",
          "Fun best part got to see it fun very fun",
          "Amazing theming. I spent hours just looking at everything here. Be sure to see it at night. If you can't get a fast pass to Radiator Spring Racers, there is a single rider line that moves faster if you don't mind splitting up your party.",
          "Cars Land was as impressive as I hoped it would be.  Imagineering at there best!",
          "Awesome fun place. A must go",
          "A favorite with our family.  Kids ages 5 to 13 and adults (Aunt, parents, and grandma) enjoyed the time spent there.",
          "The best ride.",
          "This place is amazing for big kids and small! Be sure to ride in Luigi's dancing cars! We did it 5 times!",
          "The theming is ridiculous! Despite Radiator Springs Racers always being a line longer than 90 minutes, just being in that area of the park is a trip in itself. The chili con queso in a bread cone is a must try. They have a special which comes with all sorts of toppings, it's almost like a taco in a pretzel cone.",
          "Great just wish they had the other cars come out like Ramon of Flo",
          "Best racing experience ever and truly my Grandsons new favorite ride!",
          "Awesome imagination and engineering. The shop merchandise leans toward the small boy",
          "Love it but the line killed my legs lol",
          "Always a great time at Disneyland",
          "I live in Florida and go to Disneyworld all the time but cars is one great ride. I'm so glad we came to Disneyland  and California adventure to see what it had to offer.  You will not be disappointed.",
          "Super awesome!! Highly recommend the Radiator Springs Racers, just make sure to get a fastpass early in the day if you aren't able to wait the full time in the standby line later!",
          "One of the best rides in California Adventures...highly advise fastpass or maxxpass.",
          "To much the wait have more preference for the fast pass ppl",
          "Great place with great rides. Almost like being in the movie.",
          "The rides are super fun. There is ice cream and merchandise",
          "Pretty cool but soooooo crowded. It will probably die down when the star wars land comes in",
          "A ton of fun with some of the best rides in either park. The neon is beautiful at night, and the Pop-cone is a favorite of ours for a snack.",
          "Omg the cutest ride ever and fun. As well\ud83e\udd29",
          "Fun but I liked the magic kingdom area more. The rides all had really long lines in the sun.",
          "My family couldn't believe how real the buildings were! It felt like we went straight to radiator springs and were part of that world. Bravo Disney, Bravo! Enjoy walking through and going to luigi's ride. It's too cute!",
          "It is themed so amazingly that you think you are actually at Radiator Springs",
          "So cool",
          "A nice land in California Adventure. My wife and I ride the easy rides in this area. We let my granddaughter and my daughters ride fast car ride.",
          "Cars land has a lot of fun experiences for the whole family. Little kids rides are very fun fun here.",
          "Had to ride it more than once because we loved it so much.",
          "Best pRt of Ca Adventure",
          "Would recommend going to the Radiator Springs Racer ride. I would say get a fast pass first before going on the ride it is worth it that waiting an hour in line",
          "Awesome place, but too many people sometimes!",
          "LOVE THIS! Cars is by the best ride in the entire park!",
          "We all loved it and my granddaughter of 3 just loves it every time she goes there!!",
          "Just a fun area of the park n huge food portions",
          "Raceway Racers is an excellent ride if you are willing to wait no less than an hour and half on the line.  On an 11 hour day, about 2 hours or more is a hefty price to pay on one ride at a park like this.",
          "Cars Land is amazing,  be sure to check it out at night, you wont be disappointed!!",
          "Love this place\ud83d\udc97 the Cozy Cone Motel venders are my favorite place to snack or eat and it just such a great atmosphere to be in\u2728",
          "The cars ride is the best ride in the whole park. Make sure to get fast passes otherwise you'll be in line for at least 45 minutes. We were able to get in two rides in a day with fast passes.",
          "Radiator Springs was well done! Not all of the staff were friendly and concerned with the safety of their guests.",
          "Cars Land has such a cool vibe with great photo ops & a variety of offerings to please everyone! There are 3 rides, a sit down restaurant, a handful of fast service window restsurants, 3 shops & refreshments stand.",
          "This is the best place in Disneyland at night. SERIOUSLY!",
          "It's the best place to be Cars land, My kids love it so much.",
          "Have you ever wanted to walk around inside of your favorite animated movie? Well Disney knocked it out of the park with Cars Land, because you are literally walking through the movie. The Details are mind-blowing!",
          "Amazing experience! Very very well done!",
          "Was awesome to visit with my boys. Felt like you were in the movie.",
          "Nice place to walk around The most magical place and it's very handicapped friendly and fully accessible to all people regardless of race, religion etc. There is handicapped parking available, as well as a fully accessible entrance to the park and even the rides. wonderful job with that",
          "When we arrived the rides were closed. We returned several times for Radiator Springs Racers and they were still closed. Finally the last time we returned at 11:30 am we were told that we were unable to pick up fast pass tickets because \u2026",
          "One of my favorite lands or places to go! I went on the car race ride alone but I met a chill college couple and got to hangout with them after the ride had a temporary technical problem for 45 minutes after we waited for almost 4-5 hours to get to the front and get on to the rides. But it was a fun experience! :)",
          "After watching the movie over and over again, it was amazing to see it in person :0)!!",

          "This is my very favorite place to visit at California Adventure the attention to detail is remarkable cars is one of my favorite movies and I love that I am able to visit Radiator Springs the attractions are even better as well as the character interactions",
          "Loved the ride,but the wait time is too long",
          "Fun, not 120 minutes wait line fun but still fun.",
          "This was such a cool experience. We hung out in Radiator Springs for hours.",
          "Fab! Exhilarating! Love the retro build-up / intro",
          "A beautiful place, it's really like you stepped out of reality and right into the world of Cars",
          "Best deals with the best service I've encountered while purchasing a car. They let us test drive a few in this offroading course that really sold me on the whole process, definitely recommend buying from these guys.",
          "Cars land alone is worth coming to California adventure it is breathtaking",
          "Super cute and really takes you into radiator springs!!",

I also was caught off guard with the picture it took of us hahaha really unexpected! Overall, it was a GREAT ride. Not  sure it'd be ok for little little kids. But eh it depends.",

          "Great place to bring young kids, great rides and experiences.",

          "Cars Land is decked out in it's holidays finest. Unique decorations with a cars theme.",
          "Cars Land is the most impressive/immersive land I've ever seen at a theme park. From walking on the very streets of Radiator Springs, to eating at Flo's V8 Cafe and more. Not to mention seeing life size characters like Lightning MqQueen, \u2026",
          "The ride was awesome but to stand in line for nearly an hour for like a minute and a half ride was very disappointing. They should've made the ride a little longer.",

          "Best part of California Adventure Park!",
          "We love California Adventure very much. It's so much fun. It's not true that it is for older kids. My 7, 5 and 3yo loved it immensely.We loved Soarin, Mupets 3D, Bug Land and the 3D movie, Goofy's Roller Coaster, Grizzly River, Ferris \u2026",
          "Hit this up first thing in the morning before you have to wait hours",
          "Racers broke down while we were on the ride. Only 2 other rides... Both more small carnival style but fun for the kids. Line to see the Lighting McQueen car too long for little kids. Nice recreation of Radiator Springs though. Racers was a family favorite ride. 3 year old didn't like roller coasters but loved this one... Not too jerky.",

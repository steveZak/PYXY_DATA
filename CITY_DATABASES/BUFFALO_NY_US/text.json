        "wiki": "The Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, formerly known as The Buffalo Naval and Servicemen's Park, is a museum on the shore of Lake Erie in Buffalo, New York.  It is home to several decommissioned US Naval vessels, including the Cleveland-class cruiser USS Little Rock, the Fletcher-class destroyer USS The Sullivans, and the submarine USS Croaker.  All three are open to the public for tours.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1976 the Buffalo Urban Renewal Agency and the Buffalo Naval and Servicemen's Park requested the United States Department of the Navy supply a decommissioned naval vessel to construct a naval park.  The construction of the Buffalo Naval and Servicemen's Park (later named the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park) started in 1977. The park was opened to the public on July 4, 1979. The Cleveland-class cruiser USS Little Rock and the Fletcher-class destroyer USS The Sullivans were part of the original display. In 1988 the Gato-class submarine USS Croaker was added. In 1989 Croaker underwent a refit.  The ships in the park remain property of the United States Navy, which inspects them annually.The park has gone through a few major changes in recent years. In 2003 the ships were moved slightly to the foot of Pearl and Main streets.  The park now abuts Buffalo's Canalside and the historic Commercial Slip within it. New structures were added including a new museum, and the new Liberty Hound restaurant opened in the summer of 2012.\nOn December 16, 2017 USS Little Rock (LCS-9) was commissioned at the park alongside its namesake USS Little Rock (CG-4).  The commissioning was the first time a United States Naval vessel was commissioned alongside its namesake.\n\n\n== Displays ==\n\nAlong with the ships, there are a variety of smaller vehicles, vessels, and aircraft are also on display at the park.  These include the Gyrodyne X-Ron 1 Rotorcycle one-man helicopter used by the US Marine Corps in the late fifties and early sixties, an Army M41 Walker Bulldog tank used in the Korean War, a Marine Corps M-84 Armored personnel carrier, a UH-1 Huey flown in Vietnam, an Air Force F-101 Voodoo flown by the New York Air National Guard's 136th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, a Nasty-class Fast Patrol Boat (PTF), the PTF-17 used by the Navy in Vietnam, a Navy FJ Fury (FJ-4) jet (equivalent to the Air Force's F-86 Sabre), and a USAAF P-39 Airacobra manufactured at Bell Aircraft in Buffalo which saw service in World War II. The sail and rudder of the submarine USS Boston are also on display here.\nThe park is located in the Canalside district near the KeyBank Center and LECOM Harborcenter in downtown Buffalo.  Hours vary by season, but the park is closed from December to March.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial homepage of the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park",

          "I have visited many Naval museums and toured different ships before, including the Might Mo in Pearl Harbor and this was one of my favorite tours. The museum was small and not all the lights were on. It left a lot to be desired there. But \u2026",

I think we're very fortunate to have something like this.",
          "Very cool! A chance to get up close to 2 military ships and a submarine. Self guided tour allows you  to go at your own pace. You definitely need to wear your walking shoes, prepare for some tight spaces, and walk some steep steps to get the full experience.",

          "Loved it there. Spent the night on board the USS Little Rock and couldn't have had a better time. Sure, there's things to find complaint with, but they're out there trying to promote history and remember our troops, all of them and they are super nice and super helpful so I'd recommend the Buffalo Naval Park to anyone that asks",

          "Great place! The boats are huge and the story of the Sullivan brothers is really compelling. The kids that were there seemed to love it. There are 3 boats to tour. One is a submarine. I would plan to stay about 2-2 1/2 hours or so. I didn't spend much time in the museum so if you do you'll need to allot more time.",
          "I'm retired Navy living in the Virginia Beach area. Every time we go to Buffalo we always visit the Buffalo Naval Park. Looking at the USS Little Rock brings back old memories when I was on the USS Seattle we would refuel the USS Little Rock at sea. It's a nice small park to enjoy.",

          "Excellent collection of historical ships and aircraft",
          "The Buffalo naval Park is a great place to see monuments to the men and women who fought for the freedom that we get to enjoy today. Please don't take that freedom for granted because once you lose it you'll never get it back.",

          "Very narrow steep steps in ships . Make sure you walk down them like it's a ladder",
          "It was okay. I'm a Navy brat that loves to tour ships and submarines. These tours are self-guided with information posted. I liked seeing everything but thought the information could have been more robust, especially on the submarine.",
          "Beautiful location",
          "Very nice place to visit with the family some events and concerts are happening here depending the day of the week.",
          "Very fun to walk around! Good tour too!",

          "I have toured the ships previously and never tire of walking through such an important piece of our history.  I learn something new everytime. The ships are well marked to direct your path and follow the guide you are given. Always a pleasure to be down on the waterfront.",
          "Nicely done. Some guiding lines should be painted again. But worth the price. Pitty it was rented to overgrown scouts ( there wasn't one under the age of 40) and they crowded the \" trail\" and blocked few passages.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of fun activities to do here and Canal Side. Paddle boating was a blast, and inexpensive for 20 minutes of fun. There is a large selection of food, even a wonderful hotdog vendor for a quick bite! \u2026",

          "The museum is great and worth the visit. Overnight encampment is not worth the time or money. The museum offers 3 naval vessels to tour; a sub, a destroyer, and a missile cruiser. The Cruiser is stock full of exhibits....almost to the point of overkill as a lot of the exhibits",
          "As a naval family we really enjoyed this experience. The park, trees, & flowers were beautiful & the monuments moving. The 3 ships were well preserved & the self guided tours were easy to follow including all parts of the ships & aspects of ship life. The two museums depicted",

          "Visit an exceptional site in downtown Buffalo. You will see how many of the military in several wars served their country. World War II, Korean Conflict, war in Vietnam, are all addressed. Other conflicts are treated with models and dioramas. Well worth the admission price.",
          "Love the Canalside with this piece of history stationed right at the harbor. Terrific choice for children to visit.",
          "Lots of fun exploring the ships. They say they are haunted, and it does feel spooky on it. It's right on Lake Erie and next to Canalfest, the new area they made up real nice. Also is the marina which is where I go for beautiful sunsets. Nothing more relaxing than sitting",

          "I took my nephew when he was in town visiting. He is a military and history fanatic. It was a great sunny day in Buffalo and was well worth the price. You are pretty much on your own to walk around the various ships and some of the displays look rather dated and fading,",

          "This park and museum is so unique and I was happy to visit. The ships on the deck are real navy ships served in the US navy at different times of history. This museum gives you a chance to get into them and discover different sections of these ships from the officers sleep",
          "My wife and I went by the Naval yard. Even though it was closed for the winter season I was in awe of the ships and submarine that were there. There is also a few smaller boats and fighter planes. Worth a look for anyone who like naval or machine viewing.",
          "The Military Park offers a variety of indoor and outdoor exhibits. The ships are great and require lots of walking and negotiating stairs. The is a circuit through the ship that is easy to follow and you can take all the time you need. The indoor exhibits offer a variety of",

          "Great place to go on board the ship and a submarine! Been there numerous times with my grandson Jack .",
          "One of my most favorite places to take visitors to see in Buffalo. Great experience to explore the ship and the submarine. The military museum is filled with interesting exhibits.",
          "Museum was closed for winter, but just looking at what they have is amazing. We'll be back once they reopen after the thaw. If you still want to look, there's a neat bar - Liberty Call that is worth a visit.",
          "Visit Buffalo's Naval and Military Park on Buffalo's fantastic waterfront. This attraction is both educational and fun for all ages. The site consists of 2 battleships and a submarine to tour and a museum of various artifacts and other transportation vessels. All proceeds help",

          "This attraction has grown tremendously over the years and has added tributes to veterans of our wars and conflicts. One of the few places you can walk aboard a sub a destroyer and a battleship. Very affordable as well. Lots of history.",
          "This was a great experience - much larger and more to see than what I thought. We took our three daughters aged 10, 13 and 15 and they all enjoyed it. Good history lesson!",
          "Was very interesting but we couldn't complete going through the ships as it got too cold. But what we did see gave you a good reminder of what people in the army go through. Once you step on the ship you can try to relive how they did during the war and see the conditions they",
          "Just to get up close to these historical ships and monuments is humbling - we were able to board the Edward Cotter the oldest working fire boat perhaps in the world when it was docked here for its 116 birthday - amazing experience - we have been on the Sullivan's many times. We",
          "This place is really cool, you get to tour the ship by your self. Its really awesome if you have a military family member who can relate. We went with our 3 kids. My husband got in free for being prior military. There is a lot of walking and climbing so if you are disabled it",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit in the Buffalo area. The waterfront is beautiful. The ships are so educational and beautiful. they do have many steps and tight spaces. But you can stay on top. Great for ages 5-95. My family loved it. perfect for out of town guests or",
          "There are self guided trails on and within each of the 3, a guided missile cruiser, a destroyer, and a submarine! In additiion there is a military museum and a nice waterside restaurant there, all just parts of Buffalo's rejuvenated and expanded Canalside area.",
          "Wasn't disappointed with the Museum. Great access around the ships and the submarine. Excellent in every way. A very humbling experience. We owe a tremendous debt to the brave men that fought in the World Wars. Many gave their lives for our freedom. Lest we forget.",
          "The Military Park is a beautiful area right next the waterfront and Buffalo River. It recognizes and HONORS all the branches of the services and all the wars. Beautiful ships that are manned by volunteers who take you on very informative tours.",
          "Yes, three in one place..... USS Little Rock, USS Croaker and the unforgettable USS The Sullivan's. Couldn't drag ourselves away from these ships, spent about 4-5 hours touring the vessels. Lots of history and stories of the brave men who served aboard. These ships are",
          "It was an amazing place, a lot of walking though, which is fine with us but not for my elderly father, he stayed at the hotel, good thing he would not have made it through the day. It's definitely all day thing, lots to see!",
          "We visited the entire \"Canalside\" area and enjoyed checking out the naval and military equipment on display.",
          "There's a battleship... a destroyer... a submarine... in another area they have a helicopter and other decommissioned military equipment. Nice family atmosphere. Kids will love it. \"Big Kids\" (meaning fathers and husbands and boyfriends and grandfathers) will love it. And just",
          "Earlier this year, my wife and I took her sister and Brother-in-law who were visiting from out of town, and her folks to visit the Naval Park. We had our won tour guide, my father-in-law, who was stationed on a sister ship of the Little Rock. There were tour guides there but",
          "History comes alive as you follow the self guided tour path that works its way thru a destroyer, guided missile cruiser and a submarine. You get a feel for what it was like to live and work aboard these vessels. Each is loaded with history, photos, memorably and fascinating",
          "Such a great place to go walk around on a nice day. You are on the water and seeing some awesome naval ships. The size of them is amazing. Kids would love this.",
          "The ships and sub are a great way to spend a relaxing few hours while soaking in History. I have done it a number of times and it never gets old. It is fascinating to see how theses war ships actually are - imagining how it was like to live and work on them - the sub especially",
          "As a US Navy veteran, seeing these ships brought back many memories--some good and some not so much. It was a treat seeing these warships and explaining various shipboard installations. A great piece of naval history and well worth seeing.",
          "Located a block a way from the Key Bank Center the Naval Park has Authentic Battleships and submarines available for tour and sleepovers. The ships and submarine were in actual use during actual wars. (Which ones im not sure) Also is located feet a way from a bar which is great",
          "We visit the Naval Park about once or twice a year with our kids and anyone else who wants to tag along. The ships hold much history as well as the growing museum that is along side ships on land. It takes a couple of hours to walk around and just enjoy the waterfront. Walking",
          "Great tour of historical Navel Ships. You get to walk where many a great military personnel walk. And who knows legend has it you may get to meet one of them that has still not moved on. If you like a little slice of history with your vacation make sure this is on your list",
          "Attended the USS Northampton CLC1 Reunion here in Buffalo. One of our tours was to the Naval Park. I went through the Little Rock Cruiser, The Sullivan DD and The Croaker submarine with one of my buddies from when we were aboard the USS Northampton Cruiser. It was a reliving of",
          "My wife & I go to the waterfront many time throughout the summer and though we always walk by the Museum, we've never gone into the warships until this year. It is amazing how tight the insides of the ships are. I can't imagine being inside them 100's of miles out to sea during",
          "What a wonderful park for those interested in military history. It's great to walk around the ships - we took a self-guided tour but I believe you can phone ahead and book a guide if you are willing to join a school group. Tickets are purchased in a separate building that also",
          "If you are in town then take a walk down by Canalside and visit all the wonderful memorials and ships they have down there. Beautiful area of Buffalo.",
          "Anyone who enjoys history should not miss this! Visitors have the opportunity to board and explore not one but three WWII era ships - including one fierce looking submarine. A must for anyone interested in military/naval history, or the time period in general. The self-guided",
          "The museum building had plenty to look, a lot centered around events and people of Buffalo, but this is the Buffalo & Erie county museum. Getting to walk through WWII and Cold War warships were cool too. There were several displays through out the ships that showed other",
          "My husband and I did this on a whim but thoroughly enjoyed it. I definitely decided that it takes a special person to be able to enlist and live on one of these ships or a submarine. Not for me. But the self guided tour was very easy to follow.",
          "I spent about three hours here touring the ships. The tour is self guided following lines painted on the floor and reading signs at stops along the way. The rooms are preserved to give you a feeing of what life was like aboard these ships (one is a sub) during and after World",
          "Very nice. Scenic and historical. Great for families. Connectics to every age. Connects to Marina and Harbor.",

          "I have been to several exhibits that are similar to this one but few have had 3 vessels that were able to be toured. All were well maintained and very informative, the park itself was very nice",
          "We enjoyed our visit to both locations. Parking is a challenge, but there are plenty of activities to keep younger children occupied.",
          "I like museums: if they feature machinery, that's good. And if it's military equipment, so much the better. The Naval and Military Park in Buffalo satisfies those requirements, and does so for about the price of a movie ticket. This has to be one of the best museum values in the",
          "We were visiting Buffalo for the first time in 60 years, and my cousin wanted to show us how the waterfront was being redeveloped. I had never really thought of Buffalo as a port...but it certainly was! He drove us down to the water front and we walked up to the Naval Museum.",
          "The Naval Museum provides a great deal of educational information to the history buffs. Very informative! I enjoyed touring the naval ships to see how the sailors lived and worked.",
          "You can take self-guided tours of the ships. The route is easy to follow, and there are informational tidbits along the way. Important note: There are a couple steep climbs on narrow ladders so this may not be for everyone.",
          "My husband being a Navy man was pretty excited to see this when we arrived in downtown Buffalo. Although we were too late to take a tour on board the ships, they were docked close enough to get some good pictures and were able to see quite a bit. It was a nice moderate walking",

          "We toured the Naval Park in the summer with our Grandchildren. They loved it and we loved it. Fantastic history and Culture lesson. It is so cool to walk on the ships and submarine that were used in World War II. The stories of the men who sailed on them and the artifacts of",
          "We tend to visit military museums, because we have two sons who served, in the USAF and USN. This museum is not the top of the line, but it presents quite a lot of material in an easy-to-understand way, with the added pleasure of being able to climb around on the three ships",
          "We went here over the 4th of July 2016, we purchased discount tickets through groupon.com, I definitely recommend visiting this place, it took about 3 hours to see all three ships on display and there is also a indoor museum which has 2 stories and a gift shop, it's right next",
          "This is a super place to visit. It's very easy to get to and the ships are fantastic. It's very unusual to find a cruiser, destroyer and submarine in one location. Go visit",
          "Went with a Navy Reunion Tour. Great Place Well informed tour guides. Toured three ships and ground displays. Nice museum and restaurant on site. A must for anyone interested in military. Tour covers most of the spaces in the Guided Missle Cruiser, Little Rock, USS SULLIVANS",
          "There is so much to see and take in! For you are from buffalo and get down to canalside I recommend getting a membership not only for support and upkeep but then you do not feel rushed you can come and go as you please exploring. Some rooms are small and can get crowded it",
          "Gotta be honest, the trip to Naval & Military park was really enjoyable. Thinking why I did not take this trip despite of spending countless years in cold Buffalo NY. If you enjoy history and prefer to learn more about Buffalo's roots, this place is for you! However, just",
          "I drive by these ships often on my way home from Buffalo. Finally, we made the time to buy a ticket and tour the ships. Touring, I learned so much about WWII. I was surprised at the tight quarters - especially in the submarine. I've always respected our servicemen and women,",
          "Great museum with tons of information. Very well put together. Informative and fun. Gives you a real feel for serving in our military out at sea. There are many steep stairs and tight spaces. Great way to spend an afternoon and enjoy Canalside afterwards.",
          "I was surprised at how much the Naval Museum offers for visitors. There are battle ships, submarine, and views of helicopter, PT boat, missiles, etc. There are also memorials to different wars and or military groups. Some boats you buy a ticket to visit and others you just walk",
          "A great place to introduce your children to the strength and legacy to America's Armed Forces. Tour the USS Sullivan, The Croaker and visit each monument that documents our participation in all wars, past and present. Surrounded by beautiful gardens, the park is serene and",
          "I was very pleased to visit this wonderful landmark. The information and the history you receive when you walk on board is amazing.",
          "This is an underappreciated highlight of the Buffalo waterfront that is a very unique experience. If you love military history, this place with be a playground for you ... everyone else, however might get a little fatigued after the umpteenth narrow hallway to squeeze through or",

          "We were in Buffalo because my husband worked in the area a few times and wanted to go to this museum. It took a couple hours to go through for us. It does have bathroom about in the middle of the walking tour (which you go thru at your own speed). There is a small store and",

          "I just want to say how much I appreciated having my wedding ceremony here some years back. The people who ran the ship were very nice and accommodating to us. It was such a unique and fun place and made for some awesome pictures. It was a rainy summer, but we were under the",
          "For 12 bucks we thought why not, and what a walking tour that turned out be. Whoever devised the route was an evil genius of, um, military proportions. So how tough could it get just strolling through three vessels tethered to the shore? We had no idea the amazing sensory treat",
          "I'm speechless. This was an amazing sells guided tour through some of us most interesting naval vessels I've ever seen. You get a great appreciation of what our sailors went through while they were serving our country. If you are claustrophobic then the sub is not for you. I'm",
          "It was a big surprise the size of this tour. As we where spending the night in Buffalo, we decided to visit this park during the morning before we left. And it took more than 2 hours to go through all the incredible ships available for visit and the museum. It totally worth it!",
          "If you are into Navel History take this tour. Interesting how so many men lived in such cramped quarters. Try an go on a day that is not HOT outside, because while touring the ship it is very warm, so much so that we decided not to tour the submarine. All in all a great value",
          "We went here on an extremely hot day and clambered up and down all three ships. It is amazing the life that Navy sailors lived on these ships while at sea and during battles! It certainly would be a must-visit for anyone who has a Navy veteran in their family or for kids who",
          "I wish I had gone on the ship. Walking around it made me lighthearted. This made me appreciate the great sacrifice made by the service members. My family can not stop talking about the experience.",
          "A great visit and wonderful walk through the three Navy ships. Some great historical displays of major conflicts that we have been involved. It is a self-guided tour...just follow the yellow line. Some displays are interactive. It was great to see several Tin Can Sailors and",
          "Going here was a cool adventure. Being in a military family and a patriots i really appreciated what the park had to offer. The ships were amazing and i couldn't believe how much you could explore. The staff was great, prices reasonable, and tons of history. The kid's were blown",

          "One of the best collections of retired naval ships I have been to. The three different vessels that included a destroyer, a cruiser, and submarine, make the Buffalo Naval Park a must see destination when in Buffalo, NY. It gives you a true appreciation for those who have",

          "This is am amazing museum where you get to walk through the ships and submarine. After my visit I am amazed at how our Navy men lived in these! Very touching story about the Sullivan family - felt very special to be on the ship named for them. It took me a couple of hours to get",
          "This was truly a site to behold! You were able to tour almost every nook of this magnificent destroyer named for the 5 Sullivan brothers ! If you know the history and even get to see the old movie made in the 1940's about the brothers and the sacrifices they and many others",
          "The tour consists of a self-guided walk thru three ships, a destroyer, a cruiser, and a submarine, all of WWII vintage. You get to see most of the living and working areas of the destroyer and submarine, but the visit to the cruiser is only a 'walk thru' rooms that have been",

          "We love history! These naval boats are awesome part of American history. The sub is hard to maneuver so if you have difficulty with tight spaces this might not be for you. Loved it! Definitely will Ho again!!!",

          "Spent a while observing these ships. Because it was too hot, though, didn't go on board. Still worth a visit!",
          "A must stop for all ages. Going through these boats that are over 70years old its quite a treat. Americans will definitely get more of the history as throughout they show the changing uniforms, battles that occurred and more. The Missile ship and Submarine are really something",

          "We had some time to kill in Buffalo and after walking the Canalside, we decided to visit this site. It was quite good. Probably not many places where you can tour a WW2 submarine!",

          "Climbing around the ships and submarine gave us a feeling of what it might have been like to be stationed on one of these vessels. The day we went there was a graduation of sea cadets, and also a wedding on board! There was a fair of veterans services around the park with lots",
          "We loved walking through the old ships! It amazed my 11 & 13 year old. We only had 1 1/2 hours to spend here and it was not enough time. The ship is real and there are many steep steps with little railings. I'm so glad we stopped here, my kids won't forget this history lesson.",
          "This is fine for some, but I found it boring. There is something about an empty ship that just lacks character for me. It is like visiting an empty barracks. The people and the cramped spaces, jostling, noise are absent. My advice, view it from the pier. Do not get me wrong. I",
          "We walked down to the Naval park after taking in a Bisons baseball game (which was excellent value!). The waterfront area was beautiful - full of activities, concerts, and the Naval Park. We paid to go onto the ships (great value again). The tour of the ships was well worth",
          "When on an old ship you WILL see at least one of the 5 Sullivan brothers who gave their life for our country and are celebrated on a ship's moniker. Some of the places (like the brig) are indeed places I would not want to be whether at sea or otherwise. One of the best parts is",

          "This is a great place to visit with kids as well as elders to get a brief history lesson and admiration for our Navy Seals and what life was like for them in combat. It's beautifully situated right near Canalside. Great just to look at from afar without the inside tour as well.",

        "wiki": "The Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens are botanical gardens located within South Park in Buffalo, New York, United States. These gardens are the product of landscaping architect Frederick Law Olmsted, glass-house architects Lord & Burnham, and botanist and plant-explorer John F. Cowell.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of the Gardens first began in 1868 when the Buffalo Parks Commission started meeting with landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmsted, Sr., and Partners. In the late 1880s, they asked Olmsted to design a new park for South Buffalo; the eventual design included two new parks: Cazenovia Park and South Park, which was created in 1894-1900 from 156 acres (0.63 km2) of farm land.South Park eventually came to house today's botanical gardens, originally known as the \"South Park Conservatory\". In Olmsted's design, the conservatory would showcase tropical plant species, while the rest of the park was designed to feature hardy species including an arboretum, pinetum, shrub garden, and a bog garden. Formal gardens around the conservatory led visitors into informal park along walking paths. South Park also was to include a large pond for boating, a ring road for horse carriages, and a meadow. However, the proposed walking paths, boat house, and bandstand were never completed.The conservatory's tri-domed glass, wood and steel building was designed by Lord & Burnham, who were among the premier conservatory designers of the time. Construction methods were based upon the famous Crystal Palace and Kew Gardens Palm House in England. When built in 1897-1899, it was one of the largest public greenhouses in the country (at a cost of $130,000). Today there are fewer than a dozen large Victorian conservatories in America. This is one of only two with a tri-dome design (the New York Botanical Garden is the other).The first director, Professor John F. Cowell, oversaw the growing of plants for the park and personally located and obtained unusual tree specimens. He spent decades exploring the Americas and the Caribbean, sending back seeds and small plants for the conservatory. Shortly after it opened, thousands of visitors to the 1901 Pan-American Exposition visited South Park's conservatory and gardens, which thus quickly gathered national renown.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

Also, it was nice when the Easter bunny was there for the kids during Easter. Otherwise, it is a great place to visit.",
          "Lovely place... lumagination was an amazing event",

          "Very well done garden and super accommodating to our family for a small wedding ceremony.  Thanks for putting up with our crazy group",
          "This is a great find. It should be on most people's visit at least once or take a tourist list.  The summer offers the outdoor areas too, but the winter is a great contrast of a warm lush green walk in fresh air to the snow outside.\n\nIt's \u2026",
          "It was beautiful!! Really enjoyed the whole experience!",
          "A beautiful and peaceful experience.  We'll be back!",

          "I have loved visiting for about 35 years now! Keeps getting better with all the new improvements thru the years. Have your wedding, wedding pictures, and reception on the grounds. Inside and outside accommodations available. Or, just spend a few hours walking around the grounds like we did today!",

          "Wonderful place to visit. I do not live in Buffalo, but my family do. And I just couldn't believe that they had not been to the Buffalo Erie botanical garden. I made it a point to get them there and they loved it. In addition, the staff there were great and friendly. \ud83d\ude01",
          "Love to walk the property. Beautiful ui l and peaceful gardens",
          "It's okay. There is clearly renovation happening which hopefully explains why a very large number of plants are in pots and/or are very mundane. At $11 per person I hope the money is being put to good use",
          "A. Nice. Day with my. Grandaughter\nSophia. At Botanical. Gardens so. Buff",
          "Beautiful and the winter event is nice family entertainment.",
          "Prices are slightly steep but we love this place!!! It's so beautiful. When I was a kid it was free so it would be nice if it was a less expensive to let my kids enjoy it more often. We also love to walk around the outside very often",
          "The whole experience was pretty disappointing. They are really letting the building go things are just unkept and dirty looking. It is just not what you would expect. The only place in the botanical gardens I really enjoyed was a cactus \u2026",
          "Lumagination was a nice romantic night. There are a couple things I would do differently.  You can't really see the plants and the labels which is okay. Someone that works there said it's not really about that... Okay if it's just about \u2026",
          "Come here if you like (or dont like) flowers, art and some animals! There newest area is really good, with the tea house. Going to go again soon",
          "So beautiful and relaxing! Great place to take the kids! There is a beautiful coy fish pond with a waterfall. There is even a beautiful green house play room for the children to play in! Sandbox, toys, books, and so much more!",
          "Beautiful flowers and greenery throughout. Very inviting and calming",
          "This place is great.  It's not huge but it has a lot to offer with plenty to see.  They even had a cactus my grandma had never heard of and she's a plant junky living in Arizona.  There's lots to see outside in the gardens as well.",
          "Good Green House atmosphere lovely plants.",
          "I moved away when I was younger and now that i have returned the Botanical Gardens are still just as beautiful as I remember. Loved the art they had!",
          "Great place to go to warm up and think spring during the long cold winter! Lumagination was a nice experience for the kids and for ourselves as well. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the upkeep is superb! Just wish it was even larger.",

          "The brochure and website made it seem a lot bigger than it really was. It was still fun and very informative but I was definitely expecting more.",
          "We visited the gardens for the Lumagination event with our kids and it was a magical experience. There was so many amazing art pieces along with the plants that it made it feel like it was more or an art gallery then just a garden. \n\nThey \u2026",

          "I lived the flowers and the plants. I went looking to scope the place out for my future wedding and was disappointed. The plants were the only thing in great shape. The venue area had uneven floors and very dirty. The front entrance had \u2026",

          "Nice place with a huge collection of plants and flowers",
          "I went for the lumination. It wasn't what I was expecting.  The pictures make it look like more than it was and it was too dark to really see the plants well. I did enjoy all the different plants and how they displayed them. I will be going \u2026",
          "I'd never been here before and it was really cool. It's way larger than you think and it's cheap as heck. Great spot for a date, especially if you're a guy and want to impress a young lady (or whatever you're into). The different rooms were really nice and being able to read a bit was fun.",
          "One of my favorite buildings in Buffalo. I love that they have been making improvements and expanding the last few years. I feel there are certain areas that need improvement though. There\u2019s one section especially where the wall is \u2026",
          "I have been going here for years and might I say they have made a vast amount of improvements. A very romantic setting great place for weddings or prom pictures. Their golfing course is free to the public. You may also see some wild life but the children love it.",

          "This is a wonderful place to visit. It can get expensive to tour the inside and see the exotic plants/flowers but I assure you it\u2019s worth it. You will see things you didn\u2019t know exist and themes change with seasons and holidays. Plants and \u2026",

          "We like the collection inside of green house,  also there is a wonderful safe place for children to spend good time where they can dig and plant flowers all by themselves while parents can relax. It was very thoughtful to organize the sink \u2026",
          "Enjoyed my afternoon at the gardens. Rather pleasant environment.",
          "Planning on purchasing a membership for this Buffalo Gem. Lots of variety of plants. Large walking area both inside and outside. Very calming place to visit.

          "It really is a beautiful place to visit. It's $11 for adult non members but I'd say everyone needs to see this place. It's not exciting or life changing but seeing a world's worth of plants all in our own backyard. It's amazing how \u2026",
          "i walk my dog here almost every day.. she loves it.",
          "Such beautiful plants and flowers everywhere the eye can see. Would love to come back another time with the girlfriend. They even host weddings as my uncle was married here and it was such a beautiful ceremony. I wish i wouldve gotten married here definitely wouldve been better than the city hall marriage.",
          "Beautiful array! My kids really enjoyed the Wegmans family garden where they have toys and a sand box. The waterfall and koi pond were a big hit with them as well. Everything was lovely and it was extremely clean!",
          "One of the greatest parks in buffalo, outdoor activities and concerts in the summer, and cool indoor activities in the winter, surrounded with nice golf course, great walk way around the park",
          "It was a nice reprieve from a cold winter day. Really enjoyed seeing all of the beautiful greenery and being able to feel rejuvenated from the surroundings. Wish I lived closer, it would definately be a place I would frequent for a mental health boost.",

          "When I used to go there back in the day it was free and now they charge to go in there which I think is extremely rude. I heard it's nice in there but I refuse to pay to go in there. Something like that should be open to the public like it used to be.",
          "Gorgeous series of glass houses housing a variety of rare plants from all the corners of the world. Came here during the Easter event and the entire garden smelled absolutely amazing from all the blooming flowers.",
          "The smell of one of the rooms is well au natural just hold your nose or wear a mask. There's no a.c. so the hotter it gets the more humid and smelly it gets... Recommend going at night when it's cooler",
          "Love the place,. Really educational and a great place to go in the Buffalo winter.  The Koi pond and waterfall was the best for me since it is a real  peaceful place in the whole complex.  The flowers for this time of year really reminds you that spring is getting closer every day",

          "What a great way to spend a day. Simply beautiful. I've had the pleasure to attend a winter wedding there and an outdoor pop up restaurant they host on Tuesday in the summer. Great date spot to take a stroll through indoors or outdoors weather permitting.",

          "What a joke.... their were thousands of people for the light show, you couldn't see a thing, it was a complete fire hazard. Botanical gardens should be ashamed of themselves for allowing that many people in there.",

          "First, the building itself is just beautiful and so historical. After paying in the lobby, we started our tour outside with the planted flower beds. We also had a scavenger hunt for the children, which kept things interesting for the kids. For the most part the outdoor beds",
          "I've been to many fine botanical gardens and in recent years, this one is right up there with the best of them. It is on a lovely, large piece of land and the outdoor gardens, while relatively small, are really nice to stroll through. The garden buildings themselves are",

          "This is everything a botanical garden should be. A lovely Victorian building designed by Lord & Burnham which opened in 1900, the Botanical Gardens, while showing a bit of wear, is still a grand site. Each room inside has flora of different types and from different climates,",
          "I was in Buffalo and wanted to do something but as there is not much except shopping I was able to find the Botanical Gardens. The place is not bad and is designed in three Green houses with multiple type of areas and plants. Then the place is further divided in around 12",
          "Usually when we visit the Botanical Gardens, the outside of the building is just lovely. Due to lots of weather issues earlier in the year, the yearly whitewashing on the outside of the glass was done later and resulted in it running down the glass. Exterior photos were not as",

          "I went here on a Friday afternoon with my daughter. Parking is close and free. It was 88 degrees and humid outside which made most of the exhibits hot. It advertised a butterfly show which was disappointing as it was really 3 butterflies in a cage. The flowers however were",

          "I was ashamed to say that even though I live in Buffalo, I had never been to the botanical gardens, even though I've been to ones in other cities. I quickly realized that I really wasn't missing all that much. The building is a classic structure (and small), but it looks like it",
          "I would drive to Buffalo just to go here! (and to visit my daughter, heehee) Between the stunning architecture and the 1st class gardens I could so live here. Or visit every day :-)",
          "The Botanical Gardens can be a forgotten attraction for many Buffaloians and visitors to the Buffalo area. Perhaps it is because of its location away from points of interest to the city of Buffalo, it tends to get overlooked as a place to visit. The Botanical Gardens are much",
          "I haven't been to the Botanical Gardens in quite awhile. It is the same beautiful building but with improvements made withing its houses. Its inhabitants include koi, topiary animals, and an incredible variety of plants from cacti to a chocolate tree. There is a vivarium, large",
          "We were just there (February 2014) and I love plants and flowers. The Orchids were in bloom and they had a wide variety of them. I took many great images and would love to go back during warmer weather so I can walk the grounds. Tip from a guy that does things like this often.",
          "We were here last night Feb. 15th 2014 for the Light the Nights it was just fantastic. The whole place was lit up with all kinds of laser lights and other types. It was are first time and won't be our last. It is definetly a must stop for your to do list.",

          "I am a docent in my regional botanical garden and always check them out. The conservatory structures here vie with or standout when compared to those in Washington DC, San Fran and Brooklyn. They alone justify a visit and drive through South Park. Topiary dinosaurs are a hoot!",

The park system was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux and developed between 1868 and 1876.\nThe park system was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\n\n== Components ==\nThe Delaware Park\u2013Front Park System encompasses the following parts:\n\n\n=== Delaware Park ===\nThe centerpiece of the Buffalo, New York parks system and located in the North Buffalo neighborhood. The 376-acre (152 ha) park was named simply The Park by Olmsted; it was later renamed Delaware Park because of its proximity to Delaware Avenue, Buffalo's mansion row.  It is divided into two areas: the 243-acre (98 ha) \"Meadow Park\" on the east and the 133-acre (54 ha) \"Water Park\", with what was originally a 43-acre (17 ha) lake (\"Gala Water\"), on the west. The 12-acre (4.9 ha) ravine and picnic grove on the south side of the lake comprise a subdivision of the latter.  A widening of Scajaquada Creek, which flows westward through the park, is called Hoyt Lake (originally Mirror Lake). The lake was a feature during the Pan-American Exposition. The Scajaquada Expressway bisects the park west to east.\nThe Albright-Knox Art Gallery occupies the park's western edge, overlooking Hoyt Lake, and the Buffalo History Museum is situated on its northern edge, overlooking Scajaquada Creek.  The park is home to Shakespeare in Delaware Park, a summer tradition since the mid-1970s, and the second largest free outdoor Shakespeare festival in the United States (after New York City's).  It is also the location of the Buffalo Zoo on the east side of Meadow Park.  The park also has a golf course, four baseball diamonds, cross country running, tennis courts, and a few soccer fields.Contributing structures are: Caretakers Cottage (1889); Lincoln Parkway Bridge (1900), designed by Green and Wicks; Rose Garden Pergola (1912); Stone Bridge (ca. 1887), the only remaining structure from the original Olmsted plan; Parkside Lodge (1914); Rumsey Shelter House (1900); Main Zoo Building (1935-1940); Shelter House (ca. 1900); and Elephant House (ca. 1912).  Located north of the park are the Parkside East Historic District and Parkside West Historic District and to the south are the Elmwood Historic District\u2013East and Elmwood Historic District\u2013West, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n==== Statue of David ====\nThe park is also home to a noted replica of Michelangelo's David. The statue was dedicated in 1903, one of only a few made directly from the original sculpture but included a fig leaf which was not present in the original. When the statue was rededicated in 2013, it was given a new plaque which corrected the spelling of the artist name from Michael Angelo to Michelangelo.\n\n\n=== Gates Circle ===\nOriginally Chapin Place, a 5-acre (2.0 ha) plot measuring 500 by 420 feet (150 by 130 m) at the intersection of Delaware Avenue, Lafayette Avenue, and Chapin Parkway.

Bidwell.\n\n\n=== Richmond Avenue ===\nOriginally The Avenue; connects Symphony Circle to Colonial Circle; 100 feet (30 m) wide and 6,022 feet (1,836 m) in length.

        "wiki": "The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) or domestic water buffalo is a large bovid originating in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and China. Today, it is also found in Europe, Australia, North America, South America and some African countries. The wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) native to South and Southeast Asia is considered a different species, but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.Two extant types of water buffalo are recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria \u2013 the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans, Egypt, and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east. The origins of the water buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp-type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river-type may have originated in India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago. After the domestication of the water buffalo in Southeast Asia, the swamp buffalo dispersed up to the Yangtze River valley between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago.Water buffaloes were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia, in modern Iraq, 2500 BC by the Meluhhas. The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffaloes.At least 130 million water buffaloes exist, and more people depend on them than on any other domestic animal.\nThey are especially suitable for tilling rice fields, and their milk is richer in fat and protein than that of dairy cattle. A large feral population became established in northern Australia in the late 19th century, and there are smaller feral herds in Papua New Guinea, Tunisia, and northeastern Argentina. Feral herds are also present in New Britain, New Ireland, Irian Jaya, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, and Uruguay.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCarl Linnaeus first described the genus Bos and the water buffalo under the binomial Bos bubalis in 1758; the species was known to occur in Asia and was held as a domestic form in Italy.Ellerman and Morrison-Scott treated the wild and domestic forms of the water buffalo as conspecifics, whereas others treated them as different species. The nomenclatorial treatment of the wild and domestic forms has been inconsistent and varies between authors and even within the works of single authors.In March 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature achieved consistency in the naming of the wild and domestic water buffaloes by ruling that the scientific name Bubalus arnee is valid for the wild form. B. bubalis continues to be valid for the domestic form and applies also to feral populations.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe skin of the river buffalo is black, but some specimens may have dark, slate-coloured skin. Swamp buffaloes have a grey skin at birth, but become slate blue later. Albinoids are present in some populations. River buffaloes have comparatively longer faces, smaller girths, and bigger limbs than swamp buffaloes. Their dorsal ridges extend further back and taper off more gradually. Their horns grow downward and backward, then curve upward in a spiral. Swamp buffaloes are heavy-bodied and stockily built; the body is short and the belly large. The forehead is flat, the eyes prominent, the face short, and the muzzle wide. The neck is comparatively long, and the withers and croup are prominent. A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest. Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead. The tail is short, reaching only to the hocks. Height at the withers is 129\u2013133 cm (51\u201352 in) for males, and 120\u2013127 cm (47\u201350 in) for females. They range in weight from 300\u2013550 kg (660\u20131,210 lb), but weights of over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) have also been observed.Tedong bonga is a piebald water buffalo featuring a unique black and white colouration that is favoured by the Toraja of Sulawesi.The swamp buffalo has 48 chromosomes; the river buffalo has 50 chromosomes. The two types do not readily interbreed, but fertile offspring can occur. Water buffalo-cattle hybrids have not been observed to occur, but the embryos of such hybrids reach maturity in laboratory experiments, albeit at lower rates than non-hybrids.The rumen of the water buffalo has important differences from that of other ruminants. It contains a larger population of bacteria, particularly the cellulolytic bacteria, lower protozoa, and higher fungi zoospores. In addition, higher rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and higher pH have been found, compared to those in cattle.\n\n\n== Ecology and behavior ==\n\nRiver buffaloes prefer deep water. Swamp buffaloes prefer to wallow in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud. Both are well-adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) in the winter to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in thermoregulation. Some water buffalo breeds are adapted to saline seaside shores and saline sandy terrain.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\nWater buffaloes thrive on many aquatic plants. During floods, they will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. Water buffaloes eat reeds, Arundo donax, a kind of Cyperaceae, Eichhornia crassipes, and Juncaceae. Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples.  Others, such as E. crassipes and A. donax, are a major problem in some tropical valleys and by eating them, the water buffaloes may help control these invasive plants.\nGreen fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n\nSwamp buffaloes generally become reproductive at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0\u20133.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older. A good river buffalo male can impregnate 100 females in a year. A strong seasonal influence on mating occurs. Heat stress reduces libido.Although water buffaloes are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year. Water buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying oestrus, conception rate, and calving rate. The age at the first oestrus of heifers varies between breeds from 13\u201333 months, but mating at the first oestrus is often infertile and usually deferred until they are 3 years old. Gestation lasts from 281\u2013334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days. Swamp buffaloes carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffaloes. It is not rare to find water buffaloes that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years have been recorded.\n\n\n== Domestication and breeding ==\n\nWater buffaloes were domesticated in the Indian subcontinent about 5,000 years ago, and in China about 4,000 years ago. Two types are recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria \u2013 the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east. The present-day river buffalo is the result of complex domestication processes involving more than one maternal lineage and a significant maternal gene flow from wild populations after the initial domestication events. Twenty-two breeds of the river buffalo are known, including the Murrah, NiliRavi, Surti, Jafarabadi, Anatolian, Mediterranean, and Egyptian buffaloes. China has a huge variety of water buffalo genetic resources, with 16 local swamp buffalo breeds in various regions.\n\n\n=== Genetic studies ===\nResults of mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that the two types were domesticated independently. Sequencing of cytochrome b genes of Bubalus species implies that the water buffalo originated from at least two populations, and that the river-type and the swamp-type have differentiated at the full species level. The genetic distance between the two types is so large that a divergence time of about 1.7 million years has been suggested. The swamp-type was noticed to have the closest relationship with the tamaraw.Analyses of mitochondrial DNA and single-nucleotide polymorphism indicate that swamp and river buffaloes were crossbred in China.An analysis of the genomes of 91 swamp and 30 river buffaloes showed that they separated already before domestication about 0.23 million years ago.\n\n\n== Distribution of populations ==\n\nBy 2011, the global water buffalo population was about 172 million.\n\n\n=== In Asia ===\n\nMore than 95.8% of the world population of water buffaloes are kept in Asia, including both the river-type and the swamp-type. The water buffalo population in India numbered over 97.9 million head in 2003, representing 56.5% of the world population. They are primarily of the river type with ten well-defined breeds: the Bhadawari, Banni, Jafarabadi, Marathwadi, Mehsana, Murrah, Nagpuri, Nili-Ravi, Pandharpuri, Surti and Toda buffaloes. Swamp buffaloes occur only in small areas in northeastern India and are not distinguished into breeds.In 2003, the second-largest population lived in China, with 22.76 million head, all of the swamp-type, with many breeds kept only in the lowlands, and other breeds kept only in the mountains; as of 2003, 3.2 million swamp-type Carabao buffaloes were in the Philippines, nearly three million swamp buffaloes were in Vietnam, and 772,764 buffaloes were in Bangladesh. About 750,000 head were estimated in Sri Lanka in 1997. In Japan, the water buffalo is the domestic animal throughout the Ryukyu Islands or Okinawa prefecture. It was also recorded that 889,246 water buffaloes were in Nepal.The water buffalo is the main dairy animal in Pakistan, with 23.47 million head in 2010. Of these, 76% are kept in the Punjab. The rest of them are mostly kept in the province of Sindh. The water buffalo breeds used are the NiliRavi, Kundi, and Azi Kheli. Karachi has the largest population of water buffaloes for an area where fodder is not grown, consisting of 350,000 head kept mainly for milking.In Thailand, the number of water buffaloes dropped from more than 3 million head in 1996 to less than 1.24 million head in 2011. Slightly over 75% of them are kept in the country's northeastern region. The statistics also indicate that by the beginning of 2012, less than one million were in the country, partly as a result of illegal shipments to neighboring countries where sales prices are higher than in Thailand.Water buffaloes are also present in the southern region of Iraq in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes by Saddam Hussein was an attempt to punish the south for the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. After 2003 and the Firdos Square statue destruction, these lands were re-flooded and a 2007 report on Maysan and Dhi Qar shows a steady increase in the number of water buffaloes. The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.\n\n\n=== In Europe and the Mediterranean ===\n\nWater buffaloes were probably introduced to Europe from India or other eastern sources. In Italy, the Longobard King Agilulf is said to have received water buffaloes in about the year 600. These were probably a present from the Khan of the Avars, a Turkic nomadic tribe that dwelt near the Danube River at the time. Sir H. Johnston knew of a herd of water buffaloes presented by a King of Naples to the Bey of Tunis in the mid-19th century that had resumed the feral state in northern Tunis.European water buffaloes are all of the river-type and considered to be of the same breed named the Mediterranean buffalo. In Italy, the Mediterranean type was particularly selected and is called the Mediterranea Italiana buffalo to distinguish it from other European breeds, which differ genetically. Mediterranean buffalo are also kept in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia, with a few hundred in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hungary. Little exchange of breeding water buffaloes has occurred among countries, so each population has its own phenotypic features and performances. In Bulgaria, they were crossbred with the Indian Murrah breed, and in Romania, some were crossbred with Bulgarian Murrah. As of 2016, there were 13,000 buffaloes in Romania, down from 289,000 in 1989.Populations in Turkey are of the Anatolian buffalo breed.\n\n\n=== In Australia ===\n\nBetween 1824 and 1849, water buffaloes were introduced into the Northern Territory from Timor, Kisar, and probably other islands in the Indonesian archipelago. In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to Darwin. They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and Arnhem Land since the 1880s. In the early 1960s, an estimated population of 150,000 to 200,000 water buffaloes were living in the plains and nearby areas.They became feral and caused significant environmental damage. Water buffaloes also occur in the Top End. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce water buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.During the 1950s, water buffaloes were hunted for their skins and meat, which was exported and used in the local trade. In the late 1970s, live exports were made to Cuba and continued later into other countries. Swamp buffaloes are now crossed with river buffaloes in artificial insemination programs, and are kept in many areas of Australia. Some of these crossbreeds are used for milk production. Melville Island is a popular hunting location, where a steady population up to 4,000 individuals exists. Safari outfits are run from Darwin to Melville Island and other locations in the Top End, often with the use of bush pilots. The horns, which can measure up to a record of 3.1 m (10 ft) tip-to-tip, are prized hunting trophies.The Australian water buffaloes have developed a different appearance from the Indonesian water buffaloes from which they descend. They live mainly in freshwater marshes and billabongs, and their territory range can be quite expansive during the wet season. Their only natural predators in Australia are adult saltwater crocodiles, with whom they share the billabongs, and dingoes, which have been known to prey on water buffalo calves and occasionally adult water buffaloes when the dingoes are in large packs.Water buffaloes were exported live to Indonesia until 2011, at a rate of about 3,000 per year. After the live export ban that year, the exports dropped to zero, and had not resumed as of June 2013.\n\n\n=== In South America ===\n\nWater buffaloes were introduced into the Amazon River basin in 1895. They are now extensively used there for meat and dairy production. In 2005, the water buffalo herd in the Brazilian Amazon stood at roughly 1.6 million head, of which 460,000 were located in the lower Amazon floodplains. The breeds used include the Mediterranean from Italy, the Murrah and Jafarabadi from India, and the Carabao from the Philippines.\nDuring the 1970s, small herds were imported to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Cayenne, Panama, Surinam, Guyana, and Venezuela.In Argentina, many game ranches raise water buffaloes for commercial hunting.\n\n\n=== In North America ===\nIn 1974, four water buffaloes were imported to the United States from Guam to be studied at the University of Florida. In February 1978, the first herd arrived for commercial farming. Until 2002, only one commercial breeder was in the United States. Water buffalo meat is imported from Australia. Until 2011, water buffaloes were raised in Gainesville, Florida, from young obtained from zoo overflow. They were used primarily for meat production, and frequently sold as hamburger. Other U.S. ranchers use them for production of high-quality mozzarella cheese. Water buffaloes are also kept in the Caribbean, specifically in Trinidad and Tobago and in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n== Husbandry ==\n\nThe husbandry system of water buffaloes depends on the purpose for which they are bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their water buffaloes live in close association with them, and are often their greatest capital asset. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffaloes, while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallows. Water buffaloes are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as \"the living tractor of the East\". It probably is possible to plow deeper with water buffaloes than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals and, in India and Pakistan, for heavy haulage also. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used water buffaloes for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.Approximately 26 million water buffaloes are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. Water buffaloes contribute 72 million tonnes of milk and three million tonnes of meat annually to world food, much of it in areas that are prone to nutritional imbalances. In India, river buffaloes are kept mainly for milk production and for transport, whereas swamp buffaloes are kept mainly for work and a small amount of milk.\n\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n\nWater buffalo milk presents physicochemical features different from that of other ruminant species, such as a higher content of fatty acids and proteins. The physical and chemical parameters of swamp-type and river-type water buffalo milk differ.\nWater buffalo milk contains higher levels of total solids, crude protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus, and slightly higher content of lactose compared with those of cow milk. The high level of total solids makes water buffalo milk ideal for processing into value-added dairy products such as cheese. The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in water buffalo milk ranged from 4.4 mg/g fat in September to 7.6 mg/g fat in June. Seasons and genetics may play a role in variation of CLA level and changes in gross composition of water buffalo milk.Water buffalo milk is processed into a large variety of dairy products, including:\n\nCream churns much faster at higher fat levels and gives higher overrun than cow cream.\nButter from water buffalo cream displays more stability than that from cow cream.\nGhee from water buffalo milk has a different texture with a bigger grain size than ghee from cow milk.\nHeat-concentrated milk products in the Indian subcontinent include paneer, khoa, rabri, kheer and basundi.\nFermented milk products include dahi, yogurt, and chakka.\nWhey is used for making ricotta and mascarpone in Italy, and alkarish in Syria and Egypt.\nHard cheeses include braila in Romania, and rahss in Egypt\nSoft cheeses made include mozzarella in Italy, karish, mish, and madhfor in Iraq, alghab in Syria, kesong puti in the Philippines, and vladeasa in Romania.\n\n\n=== Meat and skin products ===\n\nWater buffalo meat, sometimes called \"carabeef\", is often passed off as beef in certain regions, and is also a major source of export revenue for India. In many Asian regions, water buffalo meat is less preferred due to its toughness; however, recipes have evolved (rendang, for example) where the slow cooking process and spices not only make the meat palatable, but also preserve it, an important factor in hot climates where refrigeration is not always available.Their hides provide tough and useful leather, often used for shoes.\n\n\n=== Bone and horn products ===\n\nThe bones and horns are often made into jewellery, especially earrings. Horns are used for the embouchure of musical instruments, such as ney and kaval.\n\n\n== Environmental effects ==\nWildlife conservation scientists have started to recommend and use introduced populations of feral water buffaloes in far away lands to manage uncontrolled vegetation growth in and around natural wetlands. Introduced water buffaloes at home in such environs provide cheap service by regularly grazing the uncontrolled vegetation and opening up clogged water bodies for waterfowl, wetland birds, and other wildlife. Grazing water buffaloes are sometimes used in Great Britain for conservation grazing, such as in the Chippenham Fen National Nature Reserve. The water buffaloes can better adapt to wet conditions and poor-quality vegetation than cattle.Currently, research is being conducted at the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies to determine the levels of nutrients removed and returned to wetlands when water buffaloes are used for wetland vegetation management.However, in uncontrolled circumstances, water buffaloes can cause environmental damage, such as trampling vegetation, disturbing bird and reptile nesting sites, and spreading exotic weeds.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nIn 2007, the development of Southeast Asia's first cloned water buffalo was announced in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture's Philippine Carabao Center implemented cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer as a tool for genetic improvement in water buffaloes to produce \"super buffalo calves\" by multiplying existing germplasms, but without modifying or altering genetic material.In January 2008, the Philippine Carabao Center in Nueva Ecija, per Filipino scientists, initiated a study to breed a super water buffalo that could produce 4 to 18 litres of milk per day, using gene-based technology. Also, the first in vitro river buffalo was born there in 2004 from an in vitro-produced, vitrified embryo, named \"Glory\" after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Joseph Estrada's most successful project as an opposition senator, the PCC was created through Republic Act 3707, the Carabao Act of 1992.Indian scientists from the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal developed a cloned water buffalo in 2010. The water buffalo calf was named Samrupa. The calf did not survive more than a week, due to genetic defects. A few months later, a second cloned calf named Garima was successfully born. The Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, India's premier research institute on water buffaloes, also became the second institute in the world to successfully clone the water buffalo in 2016.\n\n\n== In culture ==\n\nIn the Thai and Sinhalese animal and planetary zodiac, the water buffalo is the third animal zodiac of the Thai and the fourth animal zodiac of the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka.\nSome ethnic groups, such as Batak and Toraja in Indonesia and the Derung in China, sacrifice water buffaloes or kerbau (called horbo in Batak or tedong in Toraja) at several festivals.\nIn Chinese tradition, the water buffalo is associated with a contemplative life.\nA water buffalo head was a symbol of death in Tibet.\nThe Carabao buffalo is considered a national symbol of the Philippines, although this has no basis in Philippine law.Legend has it that the Chinese philosophical sage Laozi left China through the Han Gu Pass riding a water buffalo.\nAccording to Hindu lore, the god Dharmaraja, of Dharma and death, Yama, rides on a male water buffalo.\nIn the state of Gujarat and some parts of Rajasthan in India, mostly Rayka as well as many other communities worship the goddess Vihat, who uses a male water buffalo as her Vahana. Also, the goddess Varahi in Indian culture is shown to possess a water buffalo and ride it.\nAccording to another folk lore, Mahishasura, a half-buffalo and half-human demon, was killed by the goddess Durga.\nThe Yoruban Orisha Oya (the goddess of change) takes the form of a water buffalo.\nIn Vietnam, water buffaloes are often the most valuable possession of poor farmers: 'Con tr\u00e2u l\u00e0 \u0111\u1ea7u c\u01a1 nghi\u1ec7p'. They are treated as a member of the family: \"Ch\u1ed3ng c\u00e0y, v\u1ee3 c\u1ea5y, con tr\u00e2u \u0111i b\u1eeba\", meaning \"the husband plows, the wife sows, the water buffalo draws the rake\". Children talk to their water buffalo: \"Bao gi\u1edd c\u00e2y l\u00faa c\u00f2n b\u00f4ng. Th\u00ec c\u00f2n ng\u1ecdn c\u1ecf ngo\u00e0i \u0111\u1ed3ng tr\u00e2u \u0103n\". H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i used to be named Kim Ng\u01b0u\u2014\"Golden Water Buffalo\".\nMany ethnic groups use the horns of water buffaloes as a game trophy, musical instruments and ornaments. Similarly, the water buffalo is the second animal zodiac in the Vietnamese zodiac.\n\n\n=== Fighting festivals ===\n\nThe Pasungay Festival is held annually in the town of San Joaquin, Iloilo in the Philippines.\nThe Moh juj Water Buffalo Fighting Festival is held every year in Bhogali Bihu in Assam.\nThe Do Son Water Buffalo Fighting Festival of Vietnam is held each year on the ninth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar at Do Son Township, Haiphong City in Vietnam. It is one of the most popular Vietnam festivals and events in Haiphong City. The preparations for this buffalo fighting festival begin from the two to three months earlier. The competing water buffalo are selected and methodically trained months in advance. It is a traditional festival of Vietnam attached to a Water God worshiping ceremony and the Hien Sinh custom to show the martial spirit of the local people of Do Son, Haiphong.\nThe \"Hai Luu\" Water Buffalo Fighting Festival of Vietnam has existed since the 2nd century B.C. General Lu Gia, at that time, had the water buffalo slaughtered to give a feast to the local people and the warriors, and organized buffalo fighting for amusement. Eventually, all the fighting water buffaloes will be slaughtered as tributes to the deities.\nThe \"Ko Samui\" Water Buffalo Fighting Festival of Thailand is a very popular event held on special occasions such as New Year's Day in January, and Songkran in mid-April. This festival features head-wrestling bouts in which two male water buffaloes are pitted against one another. Unlike in Spanish bullfighting, wherein bulls get killed while fighting sword-wielding men, the Buffalo Fighting Festival held at Ko Samui, Thailand is a fairly harmless contest. The fighting season varies according to ancient customs and ceremonies. The first water buffalo to turn and run away is considered the loser; the winning water buffalo becomes worth several million baht.\nThe \"Ma'Pasilaga Tedong\" Water Buffalo Fighting Festival, in Tana Toraja Regency of Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, is a popular event where the Rambu Solo or a Burial Festival takes place in Tana Toraja.\n\n\n=== Racing festivals ===\n\nThe Carabao Carroza Festival is being held annually every May in the town of Pavia, Iloilo, the Philippines.\nThe Kambala races of Karnataka, India, take place between December and March. The races are conducted by having the water buffaloes (bulls) run in long parallel slushy ditches, where they are driven by men standing on wooden planks drawn by the water buffaloes. The objectives of the race are to finish first and to raise the water to the greatest height. It is also a rural sport. Kambala races are arranged with competition as well as without competition and as a part of thanksgiving (to God) in about 50 villages of coastal Karnataka.\nIn the Chonburi Province of Thailand, and in Pakistan, there are annual water buffalo races.\nThe Chon Buri water buffalo racing festival, Thailand In downtown Chonburi, 70 km (43 mi) south of Bangkok, at the annual water buffalo festival held in mid-October. About 300 water buffaloes race in groups of five or six, spurred on by bareback jockeys wielding wooden sticks, as hundreds of spectators cheer. The water buffalo has always played an important role in agriculture in Thailand. For the farmers of Chon Buri Province, near Bangkok, it is an important annual festival, beginning in mid-October. It is also a celebration among rice farmers before the rice harvest. At dawn, farmers walk their water buffaloes through the surrounding rice fields, splashing them with water to keep them cool before leading them to the race field. This amazing festival started over 100 years ago, when two men arguing about whose water buffalo was the fastest ended up having a race between them. That is how it became a tradition and gradually a social event for farmers, who gathered from around the country in Chonburi to trade their goods. The festival also helps a great deal in preserving the numbers of water buffaloes, which have been dwindling at quite an alarming rate in other regions. Modern machinery is rapidly replacing water buffaloes in Thai agriculture. With most of the farm work mechanized, the water buffalo-racing tradition has continued. Racing buffalo are raised just to race; they do not work at all. The few farm buffalo which still do work are much bigger than the racers because of the strenuous work they perform. Farm water buffaloes are in the \"Buffalo Beauty Pageant\", a Miss Farmer beauty contest and a comedic water buffalo costume contest, etc.. This festival perfectly exemplifies a favored Thai attitude to life \u2014 \"sanuk,\" meaning fun.\nThe Babulang water buffalo racing festival in Sarawak, Malaysia, is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional Bisaya community of Limbang, Sarawak. Highlights are the Ratu Babulang competition and the water buffalo races, which can only be found in this town in Sarawak, Malaysia.\nAt the Vihear Suor village water buffalo racing festival, Cambodia, each year, people visit Buddhist temples across the country to honor their deceased loved ones during a 15-day period commonly known as the Festival of the Dead, but in Vihear Suor village, about 22 miles (35 km) northeast of Phnom Penh, citizens each year wrap up the festival with a water buffalo race to entertain visitors and honour a pledge made hundreds of years ago. There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plow their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease. The villagers prayed to a spirit to help save their animals from the disease and promised to show their gratitude by holding a water buffalo race each year on the last day of the \"P'chum Ben\" festival, as it is known in Cambodia. The race draws hundreds of spectators, who come to see riders and their animals charge down the racing field, the racers bouncing up and down on the backs of their water buffaloes, whose horns were draped with colorful cloth.\nBuffalo racing in Kerala is similar to the Kambala races.\n\n\n=== Religious festival ===\nThe Pulilan Carabao Festival is held annually every 14 and 15 May in the Philippine town of Pulilan in honor of St. Isidore the Laborer, the patron saint of farmers. As thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest every year, farmers parade their carabaos in the main town street, adorning them with garlands and other decorations. One of the highlights of the festival is the kneeling of the carabaos in front of the parish church.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCattle in religion\nList of water buffalo breeds\nAfrican buffalo (Syncerus caffer)\nZebu, the common breed of domestic cattle from India\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nClutton-Brock, J. 1999.

          "Given it\u2019s location, the Buffalo Zoo doesn\u2019t seem like it would be very impressive, but that is not the case. One can see a refreshingly diverse set of animals here while feeling quite close to them. I could reach out and touch the giraffes \u2026",
          "This is one of the oldest zoos in the US. Although small in size you can expect an excellent experience with a visit there. It\u2019s actually best to go when it\u2019s not overly warm and sunny as you are more likely to be able to see more animals \u2026",

          "The park is nice. However, it seemed to us that the animals lacked some space. Some species deserve to be better developed. Anyway, the park is nice and the walk friendly. It is clean and very easy to evolve in the zoo without getting lost and without missing anything.",
          "Wonderful. The dinosaur exhibits excited me and my great grand children.",
          "Went with my nephews (all under 8 years old) and they loved it. The park map was easy to understand. The restrooms were quick to find. They even had some of their reptiles out for a meet and greet! As with any zoo I've attended several segments were under construction. The kids loved having the animatronic dinosaurs all over!",
          "Sad little zoo. Paid $45 USD for 2 adults and 1 child and within 1 half hours we were done. The playground was closed. Food court had only hamburgers and hotdogs (1 restaurant working). The elephant exhibit was closed, the rhyno was closed. \u2026",
          "I went when it was cold and they had a lot of indoor exhibits which was great. Also it was the first day of Zoo lights and the set up was really nice",
          "I haven't been here since I was younger. My gf and I go to zoos when we travel, so I had a few to compare it to. The animal variety here is excellent. It's easy to navigate and the more updated sections such as the reptile house and rainforest area are fantastic. Can't wait to go back.",
          "Best zoo animals close for kids to see\n No need to walk a lot to see a lot",
          "We love the Buffalo Zoo!  We have had yearly passes and are regular visitors.  Definitely a top place to bring your family for a lovely day.",
          "It's a super fun place to go and they do a really good job with the space that they've got. They don't have room to expand, but they're often upgrading their exhibits. The zoo membership is well worth it if you plan to go more than a few times a year.",
          "What a great zoo for the family. I particularly found the Buffalo Zoo to be well taken care of. All of the facilities were very clean. The size of the park is very friendly to families with young ones who may not want to walk very far. It's also surrounded by Delaware Park and the historic Delaware Ave. This is a must visit for Buffalo.",
          "Went here shortly after we got engaged and had a lot of fun :)",
          "It should be closed down, to small for the animals. Everytime I think hmm this will be nice and educational, then I realize we live in modern times and this is an old cruel form of entertainment.",
          "Love the relaxing atmosphere! The animals look well taken care of. All the different animal habitat's have a few fact's that adults and children can learn from. The only complaint is the food is kinda pricey and you're not allowed to bring outside food in.",
          "Great zoo, quiet, and you can get fairly close to the animals",
          "Was ok should be better once it gets warmer out",
          "Starting with the good. This zoo is perfect for us since we live close by in Buffalo and I have two young children. They love the animals and right now the dinosaurs that are around the park. \n\nWe have been members for 2 years. The first \u2026",
          "Have been coming here for as long as I can remember. Field trips, themed days, just for fun, dates, etc. I have always enjoyed the zoo.\n\nParking can be dicy on weekends when the weather is especially nice, my wife and I had to park on the \u2026",
          "Always a relaxing experience. Great place to spend a few hours",
          "Always enjoy taking my nieces and nephews here to see live animals.\n\nI believe the animals are treated humanely regardless of a persons stance on caging wild animals.\n\nThe workers are full of knowledge. Very much tailored to a younger age \u2026",
          "Not alot of animals",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is good but not if you come from a large city such as Toronto. Haven't been here since the elephants have left to another city. Love seeing the tigers,leopards, and giraffes. The day we went it was 45 degrees out with wind. \u2026",
          "Visited later in the afternoon, some animals not available. Very much improved since the last time I visited. Will go back.",
          "Really mixed on this one. While the zoo does a great job in maintaining  the animals, it is sad to see while animals in such small areas. They look like they are well cared for but it is sad. I know Toronto zoo gave up their elephants .. the toronto zoo has much larger areas for their animals.",
          "Pretty nice zoo, especially for one on the smaller size. Lots of exhibits and very clean, the polar bears were especially cool. Make sure you buy a token when you buy your entry tickets because they don't tell you to do so, if you don't you'll have to turn around because you won't be able to leave the parking area.",
          "We had a great time visiting the zoo on a cool, windy day. Some of the animals were more active than in the warmer weather and it was also great to visit the indoor exhibits to warm up!",
          "Fascinating place! I really enjoyed.",
          "This is a small zoo which is just right for a two year old. Loved the photo opportunities and the animals seem content. The giraffe house is exceptional.",
          "I was impressed by the amount of animals still out during the winter",
          "I love how they added the dinosaur robotics throughout the zoo. The polar bear exhibit was cool. They swam up close to everyone. They were fun to watch. The only reason the zoo didn't get a 5 star review was I missed the elephants. They used to be our favorite animal at the zoo. I wish they could bring them back.",
          "Kudos to Buffalo for having awesome animals, and really decent space for the animals to roam. The polar bears have a stellar sweet up, giraffes are impressive, the Lions hang out is awesome, and the rhino is pretty awesome. I think it's \u2026",
          "My grandchildren had a wonderful time on Saturday at the zoo! The exhibits are all interesting and clean and everybody was so knowledgeable. And the dinosaurs were so cool!",
          "We went to see the Christmas lights at the zoo with my children it was a wonderful time not many animals could be seen but we did see the bald eagle but it was a nice time with my family",
          "A great place to go when looking for something to do during the spring, summer, and fall! Mulitple times too. Am overcast cooler day will usually allow more sitings of animals. Not too pricey, and a fun couple of hours, plan for 2 to 3 hours to see everything.",
          "I love every visit to the Buffalo Zoo. Rainforest exhibit is cool.",
          "See animals from all over the world and learn how they are trained",
          "Full disclosure, we are members and have been for several years. We enjoy the exhibits and how they are always planning for the next step in drawing people. The polar bears and bald eagles are my two favorites. The new reptile and amphibian \u2026",
          "Always a good time. Warm day an animals active;)",
          "Nice place! Most of the animals had decent sized enclosures. And even on a chilly day in October, most of the animals were out playing around!",
          "Went on a field trip with my son, had a great time. I would suggest not taking the 30 minute tour, definitely not enough time to see everything. But we still had fun, the animals were great!",
          "Good zoo. Need to have more animals",
          "Amazingly big smaller sized zoo.  Take that with a grain of salt since I was lived by the Bronx Zoo most of my life.  Very friendly people, nice close up exhibits, I just wish some shows were during the weeks (not sure if there are any and \u2026",
          "Had a wonderful trip with the family. Very clean and friendly environment. They had many more exotic animals than I anticipated which was a nice surprise!",
          "The Buffalo Zoo currently has so many wonderful features to check out. There are animatronic dinosaurs throughout the park. Train and carousel rides are available. Perhaps my favorite stops were to featured animal chats. They brought a \u2026",
          "A nice little zoo but it\u2019s quite smaller than Toronto or Detroit\u2019s. However, if you have a membership to another zoo you might be eligible for 50% off admission!",
          "I recently went to the Buffalo Zoo. Had not been there in many years and the improvements made are wonderful. The entrance is now in a new location and it makes you feel like you are going to a real zoo. The new polar bear exhibit is \u2026",
          "The exhibits were nice, hard to pick a favorite, maybe the rhino because the baby rhino was just so cute, loved all the new baby animals! It was extremely humid the day I went with out of town guests. I was glad the soda machine accepted \u2026",
          "What a great time! Very kid friendly, the zoo is smaller but it\u2019s nice because the animal enclosures are bigger. All the animals were active and looked happy!",
          "Was a very hot day when we went so animals were not active. Were quite a few animals not on exhibit. The park itself was well kept and clean. Lots of trees for shade.",
          "Love this zoo! We have a family pass. Clean, spread out enough that exhibits aren't right on top of each other, and the polar bears are great!",
          "Well maintained.  Very clean.  A lot of animals",
          "This is a nice zoo, a good variety of animals. I wish they had a better \"petting zoo\" type of option. Maybe zoos were just better when I was a kid?",
          "Fun trip to the zoo. Very clean, all staff was so noce and helpful. (Just keep an eye on all your items. We had my sons hat&toy stolen from our stroller)",
          "My son loves going to the Buffalo Zoo! Not too big, but big enough to spend a couple of hours.",
          "I just went here for the first time today. I didn't think I'd have that much fun, long story short, I did have fun. I'm a huge fan of the big cats so I headed straight to see the lions and tigers, such beautiful animals. Some of the \u2026",
          "The animals seem happy and well kept.\nThe staff was nice.\nThe wait at the front gate is a little long especially when it's really sunny and hot out.\nSmall, well kept grounds, with places to sit and patches of grass to sit on.\nThere is a feed the birds activity as well as a figure 8 train ride for the kids.",
          "I think the zoo has a great layout. It looks really well kept. This year they had the dinosaurs on display so that was nice. The food is expensive and not much variety. And when we were leaving and the last two people in the line the girl \u2026",
          "This zoo has made great progress through the years.  The animals actually look happy and content.  There is plenty for the whole family to do.  Highly recommend!",
          "It's not the biggest zoo around, when compared to Pittsburgh or Toronto (which is gargantuan), but it's great for a quick ride down there with the kids to enjoy a day of seeing animals. If you're an adult couple...maybe one visit is enough \u2026",
          "Good zoo.  Been here multiple times, usually get the year long membership.  All comes with some free clearasil ride tickets and a free friend pass per visit.  Will go again, and again and again.",
          "Nice family fun. My granddaughter loves seeing all the animals and playing on the playground. We bring a snack or pack a lunch.",
          "Love it during winter time hardly anyone there plus cheaper due to polar bear discount. Lots to see.",
          "Great little zoo. They just remodeled the reptile house and did an amazing job. Great place to take little ones. Also the onsite food is decent.",
          "Awesome dinosaurs so many varities of animals and loved the mist helps alot",
          "It seems like they've added so much more this year, and all the exhibits were open. We went today and it was just a perfect day! The weather was great and the animals did not disappoint!! We really enjoyed Heritage Farm where we could climb \u2026",
          "The zoo is not that big but has a good little set up. It has some pretty cool animals and exhibits. They add some things that are not permanent at times also. I was pleasantly surprised with what was there.",
          "Love the Buffalo Zoo! Sad to see the elephants are gone but we understand. New dinosaurs are out around the zoo to see! One even shoots water. Many great exhibits both inside and outside. Large playground, bone digging site and lots of food choice!",
          "Fantastic place. It's great getting to see all the animals, and there's an app you can download to do a type of listening your as you go around. I didn't get to see the new baby rhino or sea lion, but I did get to see the new sand cats, and \u2026",
          "This is a great place to spend some quality family time. Bring the whole family. Not so small that it feels cheap but not so big that it takes more than a few hours to see it all. Memberships are a perfect gift for families with young children.",
          "It was almost horrible we drove 2 hours for us to not make reservations because it never said we had to and we payed 15 for tickets were a 5 person group very much will not come back",
          "It's not worth the money or the time. 2 adults and 1 child were $45 usd and it was small and sad looking little zoo. Not as it's portraited in the Buffalo website. Very disappointed",
          "Great zoo and animals. Clean. Decent price. Food needs help",
          "Small zoo can walk easily around.  Animals when on display can easily be seen within their environment.  Good value for admission.",
          "Great zoo for the size/price. My kids love the Erie canal exhibit where they can play at mucking out stalls and collecting eggs. There is a sweet little playground in the middle that is a nice break for the kids. I especially recommend the otter feeding time, so cute.",
          "While this is the 3rd oldest zoo in the country, it's not laid out very well. They don't give out maps when you buy your tickets. Apparently there was a scavenger hunt with the dinosaur exhibit they were having, but we weren't given the \u2026",
          "I love this zoo so do my kids we always have a blast when we come",
          "The light show for christmas was ok, but spring and summer when all animals are out, is fun.  It's a small, but alot of animals",
          "Always a great visit.  Day was insanely hot and they had misters to cool the people and misters to cool the animals.  All the animals seem very well cared for.",
          "For the price is excellent. A big zoo, many animals to see. Recommended.",
          "Love that since I was a little kid and I still want to go and get in free like I used to when I was a little kid",
          "Good educational facility.\nGreat for children and adults.\nAnimals well cared for.",
          "I like the lions there. They are so pretty.",
          "I highly recommend purchasing a membership. You are able to get a few free parking passes and some ride tickets for the kids with the price of the membership.  We take the kids to the zoo once every week or every other week during the \u2026",
          "Always a fun trip to an amazing zoo. We live in Toronto and bought a membership because how kid friendly everything is. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their work and will spend lots of time talking about the animals.",
          "Zoo itself is clean, big and open in winter time! Don\u2019t forget to take a map on the entrance, it would make you life easy to navigate in the zoo much faster. Kids can celebrate their birthday at the zoo. There was a birthday celebration when I went. Best thing for me  was Polar Bear Day!",
          "Inexpensive, a little small but great for young kids.  You can go through the entire zoo in 2 hours, taking your time.  If you are looking for an all day outing.  Go to Toronto Zoo. That's a world class venue.",
          "Small zoo. The elephants and sea lions weren't there but the baby Rhino was absolutely adorable. All in all a relaxing atmosphere and a nice time.",
          "What a great place to bring the kids or even just go to enjoy the day by yourself. If you enjoy seeing a wide range of wild creatures in there natural habitat you will enjoy visiting the Buffalo Zoo",
          "Omg it was soo much fun coming to visit. Its a must visit place if you are in the area or are planning a trip like we did.",
          "It's a wonderful place to take family it's a place of joy and fun. It's like $8 per adult parking was 5 but you can park near by for free. They've got some cool animals lions tigers giraffes elephant got moved and polar bear I'm guessing \u2026",
          "Such a wonderful zoo with many terrific exhibits and animals. My favorite is the rain forest exhibit",
          "The zoo animals are so active during the off season. It is much quieter than the summer months and you can enjoy the animals much more.",
          "Great zoo, has some sections which are inactive which is unfortunate but this zoo has a wide selection of animals and activities for the whole family",
          "I loved the Buffalo Zoo when I was a child. Still the same footprint as then but so much better with new and renovated exhibits.  My granddaughters visit many times each season. They never get bored going there.",
          "Great place for families.  Nice, clean zoo with plenty to see and do.  I highly recommend zoo membership.",
          "Beautiful place to be.... fun with your kids and grandchildren....",
          "Great place all around! The animals are kind and kept nicely, very visible to the public eye (if outside of their cubby areas) the enclosures for many of the animals are much to small. The food is mediocre and expensive and so is the gift \u2026",
          "My 5 year old loved it! A zoo in the middle of the city!! Wow",
          "Zoo is well maintained and the animals always  keep my children excited about  going there.",
          "Was a slow cold day. Was a great day, we had the Zoo almost to ourselves!",
          "My family loves the zoo! I even took my boyfriend for the first time last year and he enjoyed it. I'm excited for all of the new things coming to the zoo this spring.",
          "It's good to see the zoo making updates and adding more exhibits. The new reptile building is basically the same layout with some added animals. The boomerang island exhibit is definitely worth the $3 I'd recommend it. The zoo is I believe \u2026",
          "First time to the Buffalo Zoo! I took my infant daughter and a friend.... We loved it! So easy to navigate, great exhibits, and the Dinosaur experience was fun! I'm looking forward to future visits \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04",
          "This is one of my favorite zoos. I miss that there are no more elephants but the rest of the exhibits were great! I brought my son here for the first time (since I now live out of town) and he enjoyed it just like I did at his age. \n\nThe \u2026",
          "It was my first time going to the zoo in over about 15 years. My entire family and I went, we were very disappointed. \nWe where standing in line to buy tickets for over a half-hour, one person was taking customers...It was 86 degrees \u2026",
          "Our family has a membership to the Buffalo Zoo.  It is a great place to spend the day.",
          "The zoo can be a little depressing, but they are trying... Great for kids. Sometimes disappointing depending on what time of the day you go. Sometimes the animals are hot and hidden away... But that is how it is for any zoo.",
          "New Dinosaur displays are amazing. My two year old lives dinosaurs so this was perfect. We had a great time",
          "Nice zoo. Kinda sad to see the polar bear in the hot sun with little shade though. I thought they were supposed to be in a cold environment? Really confused by this. Other then that nice way to spend a summer day!",
          "Amazing display for the kiddos. Great animals also. Hope to get the elephants back. Idk what happened. But they're already missed. \ud83d\ude25",
          "I'm originally from Shiraz, Iran and i can say that our zoo was without a doubt the better one to visit comapred to the buffalo \"zoo\". That is a bold statement considering the animals i saw in Shiraz were a few mules and a underfed lion.\n\nHowever the buffalo zoo still offers a nice atmosphere for walks if it's sunny out.",
          "Went to a kids party and the staff assigned to us was great, she had the right attitude patience intolerance let the children this is the way all places should be and I'm an adult and had a great time.",
          "The zoo is nice but there is Lake of signboard, we had to navigate only with the map which we had in our hand. It was quite confusing and we were trying to find out different animals by guessing where they must have  been located seeing other surrounding animals. I would recommend to put up signboards.",
          "I usually love the buffalo zoo but I am sad that the elephants are gone and that the train and carasol were both under maintenance.  Also, we pay we family membership for years and years and years and they made us pay to feed bird :/ plus side was the baby rhino!",
          "Took 10 year old granddaughter to Buffalo Zoo on 7/26/19 and would have been far better off taking her to the Rochester Seneca Park Zoo.  Was last at Buffalo Zoo August 1997 & condition in 1997 was a lot better than it is currently.  It is \u2026",
          "Today was an amazing day. Most of the animals where out and about so we really got to see a lot. The rain forest exhibit was really enjoyable and warm in this chilly weather. There was an Ocelot, anteater, monkeys and several other \u2026",
          "The Pittsburgh zoo is better because they switch out the animals. Andthere is a straighter path so you can see where you're exactly where you're going and you don't get lost.",
          "The animals seem very well taken care of and happy. The zoo was very clean and the dinosaurs are really cool. I love going to the zoo!",
          "Great opportunity for whole family to learn and enjoy animals of the world. The Buffalo Zoo is clean inside and outside.  It's cold right now and the surrounding park offers clean and well lit paths to walk and enjoy a wonderful Green space \u2026",
          "Always love the zoo! The dinosaur was fantastic and the reptile house is very nice.",
          "The Zoo has a done a good job of upgrading the animal housing and exhibits over the past few years.  Seems to get better each time I go.",
          "Very nice zoo to visit. Took grandkids, they had a blast!",
          "The staff was friendly the animals living space looked very clean and although my visit was in the colder season they seemed to be happy.\ud83c\udf3c",
          "Sand cats, a red panda and an anteater! Plus there were many more great animals. However, the customer service at various places throughout the zoo was sub par. The entrance fee was more expensive  than similar sized zoos, on top of having \u2026",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is the perfect place to take your kids.  We spent about 4 hours there and I highly recommend it.",
          "Amazing need more free days\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d",
          "One of the best zoos I've ever been to.",
          "Loved the pre historic animals, giraffes were outside.  Didn't get to see the baby rhino though. My family enjoyed it, especially my 2 year old grandson. Was alot of fun tonight.",
          "We visited the zoo about 5 years ago and loved it.  Our visit last week was very disappointing. There were very few animals, instead they have mechanical dinosaurs (which the kids loved).  So sad.",
          "I have to say I\u2019m extremely disappointed in our visit. My wife and I took our 18 month old here and while I think she had a good time, I would never come here again. The main reason being that they just want to nickel and dime you. Having \u2026",
          "Great place for the family during summer and fall. Small playground for toddlers. During summer enjoy carousel, bone digging, and more. During winter free parking but noticeably less attractions Available. Recommend new polar bear exhibit. \u2026",
          "really improved over the last 5 years.",
          "Great variety of activities and animals. Small enough to not overwhelm.",
          "I love the zoo. Its always pleasant and we have never had any problems. Just recently I was there and I needed to breastfeed my daughter so I asked if there was a nursing place and there was and when I got it there I couldn't believe that \u2026",
          "Not sure if it was the time of year or time of day, though almost every animal was asleep. Yes they're animals you cannot control that, though it felt like they were drugged to sleep especially going at 10am to past noon. \n\nGift shop was \u2026",
          "We arrived a little later than I had hoped to. So we kind of rushed through some of the last exhibits we saw. The staff was friendly. The zoo seemed clean. Our kids had a great time. I would go back and visit here again.",
          "5 stars. My son and I love the  Buffalo zoo. We always have alot of fun.",
          "My family enjoys the Buffalo Zoo at least once every summer. Prices are high throughout the zoo; not just at the gate. Its an exciting place to keep you entertained for a little while. There's tons to do and see for people of all ages. Also depending on the time of day, most animals were not in their habitats but understandable.",
          "It's a really good place to go for a day out with your kids or just you and your spousethere's a lot of nice animals there unfortunately they no longer have the elephants the price seems to be a little high as of 2019 $14 per adult",
          "So many animals and very unique structure!! The food is Also amazing  only a little expensive but overall good for family outing!",
          "We love going here in the winter time. Gets the kids moving and gives us fresh air and we get one on one time with some of the animals-like the sweet giraffes that seem like they need a hug. Bathrooms are very clean and warm in the winter, and the water animals are super active and fun.",
          "Love to take my granddaughter to zoo they love animals",
          "We like the addition of the dinosaurs. Great work",
          "Nice time today. Easy to navigate the park. Wide paths are great. Park is well kept.",
          "Pretty standard zoo. Much bigger than Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester if your from the area. Seal exhibit needs some attention, maintenance. Awesome animatronics dino exhibit in summer of 2019",
          "Great zoo. Lots of variety in animals. Buildings are clean. The food is actually really good too.",
          "Great place for the family during summer and fall. Small playground for toddlers. During summer enjoy carousel, bone digging, and more. During winter free parking but noticeably less attractions Available. Recommend new polar bear exhibit. Rainforest area great place during cold days.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is really making great exhibits that are interactive and animal friendly. We've enjoyed our visits there. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "The zoo's come a long way since I was a kid and they're still making improvements. We always enjoy ourselves.",
          "I hope the Zoo accepts adults that it\u2019s not for kids and families! It sounds like a nice day!",
          "Nice medium sized zoo. Clean and animals and they look well taken care of. They've come a long way since I was a kid. Polar bears, elephants, giraffes, lions, gorillas, rainforest enclosure with birds, and other animals, reptiles, gorillas, \u2026",
          "Went on a Sunday was pretty empty animals were very well taken care of exhibits cleaned!",
          "Very sad at the current status of the zoo. Saw about 3 or 4 animals on our visit. Could've just went for a walk in the woods and saw more.",
          "Great place to take the kids! They dinosaurs are a very cool addition! Must see!",
          "So much fun, even in the winter!",
          "Okay zoo most of the animals were sleeping or in cages.  Elephants were relocated in 2018, big disappointment to my boys. Giraffes were nice but no tigers either omg.",
          "I like that it wasn't crowded. Me and my kids enjoyed ourselves even though a lot of animals were sleep as it was a very hot day.",
          "Labor Day at the Zoo was great once we got inside.The line wrapped around building.Many families were there on $5 day.",
          "Great to see a polar bear playing with a toy. Enjoyed the display about polar bears as well. Got to see gorilla enrichment treats being caught and gathered by the troop. Nice selection at the gift store. Took a star away for not clearing the sidewalks so it was difficult to push the wheelchair.",
          "I love the zoo I loved it ever since I was a kid. But what I live the most is when me and my boyfriend went in the bird Forest and feed the bird. It cost $3 and went in it 3 times but it was so worth it.",
          "Truly enthralling experience.  Delighted and looking forward to revisiting!",
          "Great great place! Only down fall I have is that it's Buffalo and the prices for even a water is a little too much. They should make it so it's a little more affordable.",
          "Love the fact this place is close to home. Where I can walk to rather drive & have to find parking",
          "Real good place to be with fam",
          "Not all animals were out a bit chilling for them, bit I would suggest the giraffe's barn be bigger for them alot of pacing in too small of a area.",
          "We had a great time seeing the new reptile house and the sand cats.",
          "Perfect place to take your kids if you have the time. The prices for food can get crazy at the burger place, but the actual food is pretty good.",
          "Great customer service. The front gate employees were kind and knowledgeable. I am definitely considering a membership!",
          "It was alot of fun. They have many animals. Some of the exibits closed the few times inwent which is a bummer but everything else was cool. Most animals were awake and moving around. It woukd be cool if they had staff that gave information \u2026",
          "Lots of fun n big park, but more entrances should be open, a water pad for kids would be great on hot days, sprinklers or mists for people, better air conditioning in closed areas and open all back exits to leave park it's to much to exit from same entrance, especially for the disabled.",
          "Fun time! All the animals were out and entertaining.",
          "I went to a birthday party here recently. I really liked that we were able to pet some animals and visit the zoo all day afterwards, but the polar bear wasn't out when we made a special trip and took the little ones on a long walk in the \u2026",
          "Nice place but many of the cells were under maintenance and many are closed due to non season. Wanted to see kangaroo n elephants which we couldnt see there. But sea seal, polar bear were really nice.",
          "I liked it people says it's not a good zoo but it was fun",
          "The Buffalo  Zoo is a medium size facility but arguably one of the best zoo's in the region. The Buffalo zoo is an excellent place to visit with both kids and youth groups. The animal exhibits are all reasonably placed and Do Not require a \u2026",
          "Well maintained. Bring your own food if you can.",
          "Great place to bring the kids. So many great exhibits and animals.",
          "It's been quite some time, years actually, since I visited the Buffalo Zoo and I had a great time. I was however disappointed that the Elephants had been sent to the New Orleans Zoo \ud83d\ude14 Well hopefully they'll be back !!!",
          "It's been a long time since I last visited . Had a great time   Thanks to a special security guard named Ethan thanks for the help with the stroller",

          "Great exhibit within the space limitations",
          "Although small, the Buffalo zoo is doing the best with what they have, and we're glad to have it! Baby Mohan is also very cute!",
          "Great costumer service!",
          "We miss the elephants but watching kids react to the animated dinosaur models was a good substitute.",
          "Excellent experience.   The only thing that would improve it would be a water mister for the kids (and adults) to cool off.",
          "This was a great experience! Everything was clean many of the animals were out! They had a Easter egg hunt available for the children.",
          "Good local attraction. The place could be a little bit more well maintained.",
          "Nice zoo. They recently updated their reptile  area. Parking is crowded, so get there early.",
          "Breakfast with Santa was great & so was the food",
          "Amazing animals, very clean,  great workers, were very welcoming and answered questions about the animals, the zoo keepers seem very experienced and clearly care for the animals. Definitely going to visit again on a day with less wind.",
          "It was good but it used to be free and now you have to pay a lot more then nothing. I love the animals and the park but I hate that you have to pay for things in side\nBut other then that I love it here",
          "They didn't have all the animals, some were sleeping or not visible. General admission was $18 and kids under a certain age get in free. It wasn't crowded so the exhibits were easy to get to and see.",
          "Awesome!!! Although I did see a rat in the red faced monkey exhibit.",
          "Don't even know why buffalo have a zoo.",
          "Kind of a lousy zoo. Small, frumpy exhibits. Cities with similar metro populations have generally better zoos. Cleveland and Pittsburgh for example. This zoo was junk.",
          "I love the zoo. Spoke to a zoo keeper at the farm exhibit. She didn't act annoyed by our questions and you could tell she genuinely loved to mule, cow, Turkey, and sheep. All of the staff seemed very caring toward the animals. I think if \u2026",
          "Wow you pay pretty good money to get in then they charge you for everything   you can't even.get into the birds unless you pay 3.00",
          "It's good for something to do for a few hours. Even in the winter it's good and has indoor places to warm up. There is a playground inside the zoo for little ones to play at but there is a height restriction. As of right now the reptile \u2026",
          "Lots of animals, intimate setting! Polar bear came right up to the window to take pictures with the kids!",
          "Nice zoo for young kids. Very walkable and lots of space for strollers and wagons.",
          "My husband and I haven't been to the zoo in 25 years. I cant Express how disappointed we were. There isn't enough room for the polar bears, lions and gorillas.  The reindeer have no where to run. If there wasn't a couple rides and a small \u2026",
          "Very nice exhibition, lots of animal, mammals, reptile, birds to see, very informative also, great for kids, school trips etc. Price was reasonable to enter the Zoo. The giraffe's were magnificent.",
          "Kind of depressingly blah.. Company i was with made it worth staying",
          "The zoo offers a chance to  see  animals from around the world that I would not have the chance to see.",
          "All kinds of animals are avaible over there, I'm gonna update more pics late. I love the zoo.",
          "My son loves going to the zoo. It's always a good time, it's small but not too small and you can spend a couple hours there with the family. I only wish I could get there while the Oscelots are out; I always miss them",
          "Honestly disappointed. Animals are kept in small enclosures. I was sad to even see a polar bear there. They should not be in this environment. Most of the larger animals don\u2019t have much room to roam around and they all looked so sad and \u2026",
          "I was impressed with the cleanliness of the Zoo. The layout is easy to follow and didn't make me feel crowded. The staff was very knowledgeable and seemed eager to answer any questions that we had about the animals. All of the animal houses \u2026",
          "I love the zoo.  The admission keeps going up though and the animals keep going down.  No more elephants and bears (other than the polar bears).",
          "Got to see giraffes and polar bears play in the water. Second weekend in a row. Definitely will be back next week.",
          "I always have fun at the zoo",
          "Great zoo with lots of animals to see and enjoy",
          "Not a lot of animals in the park. Staff was friendly. The dinosaurs all around the park were pretty cool.",
          "It was a lot of fun but there were no elephants \ud83d\udc18\ud83d\ude13",
          "Love seeing all the different animals and exhibits something for kids and kids",
          "Some animal enclosures were wonderful, modern and unique for the animals.  Some were very old and small.  I hope this zoo can work to raise funds and do better for their charges. Good layout, wonderful location in the heart of Buffalo.",
          "It was okay. Im from Cleveland Our zoo is much better and bigger.  Columbus zoo is killing both. It's only 14.00 so I guess you can't beat that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
          "Great zoo and knowledgeable personnel. Nice place for children.",

          "I would like to thank Ethan in security for his outstanding help with everything",
          "Always a nice place to walk around. Not too big.",
          "Loved it but was very sad to learn the zoo got rid of the elephants. The new dinosaurs are cool af though",
          "Lovely zoo in downtown Buffalo. It's not the largest zoo but it will keep your camera shuttering.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a nice place to bring kids overall, if not predominantly for kids.  The animal exhibits are not overly extensive, and can all be viewed within a few hours.  My only complaint is getting into the zoo.  It happened to be a \u2026",
          "Great place for a day off family fun.",
          "Great place to take the kids",
          "The new dinosaurs they have their are interesting, my kids enjoyed them and thought they were real!",
          "Wonderful place to visit, dinosaur exhibit is a great addition to the zoo.",
          "Out standing zoo. A must go to for all kids and adults",
          "Need more Animals!! Finish seeing everything in half hour.",
          "The giraffe experience was awesome. And the keepers were so nice and knowledgeable",
          "Very cool zoo. Went in Feb and it was great cause hardly anyone was there. Didn\u2019t get to see the elephants or rhinos but it was great.",
          "Apparently the only people who decided to go to this zoo today, was a great experience nonetheless. Being from Rochester we wanted to see what other zoo options are available and we will definitely be back. Loved the aesthetic of the tiger and lion exhibits, my son was all about it as well",
          "We had a great time. The lions, gorillas and giraffes were our favorites. We will visit again for sure.",
          "Great place to spend with the family, teach ur kids more about animals and their habits.",
          "Our trip to the Buffalo Zoo was fun as always. We were limited in the number of animals we saw because it was very cold. But the people there are wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable. We took our time, where we wanted to and cruised through were it was outside and cold. Good day! Thank you Buffalo Zoo.",
          "Perfect sized with lots of animals!",
          "Nice Zoo plenty of animals good place for little kids",
          "Always a great day at the Zoo! Only complaint is that none of the automatic doors are working and that makes it hard when we have the stroller.",
          "People are not courteous and take turns seeing animals. Food was overpriced, horrible. Bees everywhere! Need to do some control...not kill but control!",
          "Our zoo has come a long way and makes for a very enjoyable afternoon. The polar bear enclosure is fantastic and watching Luna swim is so enjoyable. They are currently upgrading the reptile house and I can't wait to see it. It is a great family treat.",
          "Much cleaner and nicer since I went last time.",
          "I was saddened while and after visiting this zoo. It is one of the older ones but it's sad seeing the concrete slabs ,no grass for the bulk of animals. The animals that were in water you couldn't see because the water was so green and \u2026",
          "It's a very nice place to visit. The staff is uber friendly. Its just very small. There are, also, no elephants.",
          "Great zoo. Kids loved it.",
          "I love this zoo! They are very open, and deal with many issues involving animal rehabilitation and extinction issues. The visible Buffalo's are also an added bit of character. The zoo is always very clean, and we'll kept. Parking is no \u2026",
          "Beautiful gardens. Gorgeous polar bears. Stellar dinosaurs\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Went for my daughter's school field trip. It's nice here. I miss the elephants. Only gave it 3 stars cuss allot was closed. The reptile building was closed down and another area as well. Was going to go for my sons 1st birthday again next \u2026",
          "Fantastic as usual wonderful experience for the grand children",
          "First time here and was very impressed with the overall atmosphere of this zoo.  It is not very big , but there are enough animals to make for a very enjoyable afternoon. The enclosures all seemed good  for the animals and the grounds are \u2026",
          "A lot of the animals I wanted to see weren't there... Gorillas...Hyenas...for example. The other exhibits were OK. Feel like prices should be lowered if some animals won't be there.",
          "LOVE THIS ZOO! Well, we love all the Zoos around. But they each bring something beautiful and unique to their own Zoo. Gift shops are all different and so are the Animals. Fun for the whole family!! Lots of walking for those who need \u2026",
          "Great place for a family outing. Lots of hands on stuff for the kids.",
          "Fun and clean zoo! Not to big so great for a morning or afternoon trip.",
          "Huge improvements made! Love it! Clean, interactive, entertaining.",
          "Went in the winter and it was great! Low traffic and the animals were out. The design of the enclosures let's you see the animals right in front of the glass when you're inside and they're outside. An excellent zoo.",
          "Buffalo zoo is an amazing place that brings joy to both kids and adults.",
          "First warm day in Buffalo but zoo for me was a let down. No Elephants but they could use the space for something else. Couldn't get into amphibians exhibit, just wasn't that entertaining for the money spent. Ho-hum.",
          "It was very clean, educational and worth every cent. As an animal lover I love to see others put so much care towards these creatures. Miss the elephants being there letting people view their gracefull, majesticness. Loved seeing the baby \u2026",
          "Such a great place! I travel for work, and finally took the time to visit the Buffalo Zoo last week -and I'm so glad I did! The rainforest area is so cool, complete with a capybara wading through the water, free flying birds, and great \u2026",
          "Got to see the new born rhino very exciting",
          "Plenty of animals, great variety, fun, occupies your kids, and a very lively place.",
          "The zoo is well maintained by people who obviously care about animals. Even in February we had plenty to see. Lovely gift shop.",
          "It was a wonderful experience ,would definitely recomend it for all ages. Would go back for sure.",
          "Sort of borring and pretty educational \ud83d\udc2f",
          "We absolutely loved the zoo! There are so many exhibits and activities to take in compared to other zoos. The vibe is very different than the Seneca Park Zoo. I love that there are things for the kids to do besides wander around all day. My \u2026",
          "I'm not a big fan of this zoo but it's still ok. The food is cheap and it's good",
          "The zoo is small, but they do their best for the animals.",
          "Fun, local zoo. Great recent updates",
          "Who doesnt love the zoo? Not as big as the erie Pennsylvania zoo but it's still a nice place to take the kids",
          "An illustration for a miniature zoo. Animals like polar bear, giraffees, gorillas,meerkat,\nLynx,mountain goats,rhinoceros, reindeers, hyena,lions, tigers etc.Polar bears which are habitats of arctic ice fields are enscoined in a place \u2026",
          "Child had a great time! Zoo small playground fun for 2 year old!",
          "Animal variety is great, a little pricey but overall my experience was tremendous with me and my family.",
          "Everytime I go.   Something is shut down. This time, it was all the Marine life area.  Frustrating to pay full price for only 2/3 the attractions and animals.",
          "Not a very big zoo, somewhat outdated and not upkept very well. However the only other zoo I've been too was the Toronto Zoo which is more expensive and a lot bigger. \nIt was the perfect size for our toddler and a fun family outing. Just \u2026",
          "Awesome zoo. Best one I been to.",
          "Great zoo,  an older smaller zoo,  but modern,  great family atmosphere,  plenty of spots to enjoy a picnic,  they don't care if you bring in food or coolers. Open all year round.",
          "Great place to visit nice and clean great for the children plenty for young and old",
          "Always fun to see all the cool animals! They have a carousel & a train ride for the kids, as well as a food court with lots of different options & a Dippin' Dots stand!",
          "We went to say goodbye to the elephants and a wonderful staff member named Joey gave us the details and progress to make this journey as smooth a transition for them. We are sad to see them go,  our son Leo was heartbroken but felt better knowing the real story. We still have time to do a quick walk through until the departure.",
          "My husband and I went to visit on vacation. It was a blast! It was bigger than expected. We loved seeing the giraffes!",

          "Great place",
          "We had such a great time at the Zoo on a very rainy day. Not sure they were going to be open, but this was the best day to see the sweet animals. They were playing with us at the windows and we saw all the animals playing with each other as well. Rainy days are the best days at the zoo.",
          "A nice little zoo that's improving all the time.",
          "Nice and clean.  Animals were easy to view.",
          "I gave the Buffalo Zoo 1 * less only because I think they should expand more and give more room to the Buffalo and the outer exhibits other than that they have made a great Improvement and to what used to be a very depressing site.  The new \u2026",
          "Very fun all the animals are active and very fun to watch.",

          "Nice little zoo! You get a pretty personal view of the animals! Well maintained and friendly staff!",
          "A very nice zoo. You can see how they have started renovating old buildings and making new exhibits fit into the historical places. While there isn't a lot to see, there is a surprising amount of space for a nice leisurely walk.",
          "Only because of the animals I give this place a five star rating awesome Buffalo New York",
          "Good place to take the family and spend the day.",
          "A nice day trip. The animals have more room than our zoo (Rochester) and some interesting as well as the usual live here. We went in the cool of early spring and it was not crowded. The parking is tricky though so pay attention to the signs.",
          "Always hoping to see and learn more at each visit so we periodically return. Few updates but otherwise the same. Would like to hear and read more about the animals at each exhibit. Crowded parking lot but once inside it wasn't too bad. Nice walking around. Looked like a lot of preparation happening for the evening event.",
          "Small but very nice! Youbshould have more drink stands open around the park not just in the back",
          "Lovely walkable zoo. Had a great playground. Excellent exhibits. Used our zoo pass at another zoo for discounted admission. Parking was reasonable. Staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "Relaxing environment. Nice place to spend time",
          "A great place to take the kids. Some of the attractions were down to several reasons but most of the animals were there.the kids loved seeing all the animals here. I would certainly take them here again. They had a blast and it was worth every minute of it. It was reasonably priced as well. I definitely recommend going here.",
          "It is depressing to visit. I feel so bad for the animals in their inadequate enclosures, and meager facilities.  Buffalo needs to commit to having a zoo, and dedicate much more space a funds. Or close it for the good of the animals.",
          "Absolutely amazing! Such a great verity of animals. I loved how close you could get to them. Definitely making the trip back to bring the kids! Loved all the fun activities they had for children. Train, merry go round and playground. My kids would love it!",
          "If your in Buffalo go to the zoo it's excellent",
          "Best time ever.. winter is so fun at the zoo. My beautiful  granddaughter and o had a great visit..",
          "Not as many animals as I thought they would. Expensive",
          "Nice zoo for a urban location.",
          "Zoo Is always clean just wish they'd put some more money into the grounds where its needed",
          "My first disappointment was that half of the exhibits were closed when I had to pay full price. However, after seeing the enclosures that were open I ended up even sadder about the animals that were there. There is no excuse for any zoo to \u2026",
          "We are so lucky to have such a great zoo so close to us...the wife and I love taking our daughter there. A little sad that we just sent our elehants away, but hopeful they will be replaced with other great animals for our little one to grow \u2026",
          "Having a great Halloween experience.",
          "We go at least once a year. The kids love it. I feel terrible for all those guys locked in cages and small enclosures, but it is what it is.",
          "I love my hometown zoo and it's baby season!",
          "Was a little disappointed with the lack of dead space here.  Louisville zoo is way better.",
          "Amazing artic experience. Polar bear, Siberian tiger and also African giraffes. October, the zoo wasn't crowded. We had a great time. It takes around 3 hours to go around the entire place peacefully.",
          "Awesome time per the norm but there's always those that do not move along in a timely fashion to give others close up views",
          "Great little zoo! Having little kids it is great to find activities that are educational and affordable. This zoo is a great size and is very easily explored in a day (even a half day if you are tight for time). The price was quite \u2026",
          "I've been to this zoo at least 6 times.  The kids love it.  It's not an overly large zoo but, I think it's about the right size for little ones.  Plenty of animals to see and its flat and easy to walk.  It's pretty easy to navigate too. \u2026",
          "For we why where is the food so expensive id expect a rare animal to be on my platter rather than food under the quality of a McDonalds in mexico please fix your prices like you fixed that flamingos broken leg, thank you from maryannelue.",
          "Has some great walk through exhibits and lots of viewing sections for the more popular animals. However, the zoo certainly felt more child focused so those without kids will not be interested in around one-fifth of the zoo. Overall, for its cost it is worth the visit.",
          "Pretty much a standard zoo. However, I have heard the animals are treated well and it's very clean which makes it a place I never mind spending the day. The staff are friendly and there is plenty to see. They count on donations from visitors to make improvements. The animals look healthy.",
          "All the animals were a treat for anyones eyes! Missd the elephants & tigers! The giraffs & seals playd peek a boo..if, thats not a cool way to start ur day!  I'd recommend  wearing a hat in the rainforest the birds are dropping bombs. Im \u2026",
          "The polar bears we're out! All the giraffes were awake and playing! The otters were fun. The winter time is still a great time to visit the Buffalo Zoo",
          "Our grand daughter loved it!",
          "Its obviously a very touchy subject, but the kids don't understand the plight of the animal and enjoy seeing them. Suspend your disbelief and pretend they're doing good by the wildlife here.",
          "We had a great time. It was great to see Polar Bears. There is a very large sea lion. Many animals were out and about. Sure I wish they all had acres and acres of land to run and play but I\u2019m glad they are safe healthy and well fed.",
          "Close view of the animals.   Wonderful staff",
          "Great place for family to come together and point at animals that have no business being in buffalo. Very fun place to go to and learn how to strip a wild animal down to just a thing to look at, for amusement ofc. I can watch them on \u2026",
          "We've had a membership for many years. We love our zoo. We love the direction they've been going in lately with trying to improve exhibits. It'll always be a smaller zoo probably because of zoning issues but it's ok.  We have gotten to know \u2026",
          "A wonderful place to share an afternoon with your grands!! \ud83d\udc95",
          "Loved it although the Sea Lion enclosure had filthy water, please take care of the quality of water for your animals. Thank you.",
          "This zoo has kept the best animals and keeps things interesting with innovative and engaging ideas!",
          "Great zoo. Many different animals. Taken well care of.",

          "The animals are never if they are out they look sick",
          "Went to Zoo first time this year 6/4/2019,They improved the place and added many animals BUT a Zoo is not complete without elephants??!!Also I am a long time family member and they took away parking priveledges even for members!They charge \u2026",
          "Granddaughter had a great time with her dad seen all the dinosaurs there on display.  Missed the Elephants",
          "Omg the animals were alllllllll out and active. Kamodo dragon was prettttty amazing",
          "Loved the dinosaur addition to the zoo experience!",
          "It was really nice I seen the animals outside some we didn't see their inside and it was in the part of the building we couldn't go in some were talkative today",
          "Great for kids, make sure you take water.",
          "Had a fun day with the kids.",
          "Love this place great for lids",
          "Very disappointed. It has always been a small zoo, but they use to have more animals. The animals they do have aren't even out more than half of the time.",

          "Always a nice place to visit every once in a while.",
          "The zoo is alright.  It is in need of some major updates to areas and enclosures.  I understand funding can be a problem but the design of many enclosures lacks forethought and seems to small for some animals",
          "It's nice to take the kids there they love it.",
          "Nice little zoo and they're improving on the facility",
          "Many reasons but as a member i took my grandkids and neither the train or merry go round were in service.  Also parking was not included in membership this year.",
          "'s always fun comming here with the kids. They have a blast. There is the bird cage that is absolutely filled with birds that you buy food for and the birds can fly around as they please, you can pick any bird to feed and they aren't shy as \u2026",
          "They could do so much more.",
          "Fun day at the zoo the animals were enjoying the nice weather and the motarized Dinosaurs  were super cool!",

          "Nice facility, more non animal displays not a lot of animals, no bears, no elephants, a lot of empty displays, water for Otters so dirty you cannot see them, Tiger and lion display is sad looks like an outside prison yard...glad in most \u2026",
          "Okay zoo. Nothing so impressive or great. The animals could've given a bit more space to live. Loved the Boomerang the most. Not too bad for little kids.",

          "Such a cool experience",
          "The Zoo is a great place to explore with kids! We had a blast when there. You can feed the birds and play at the play ground. There are concession stands around and the staff was helpful.",
          "Seems as though they have less exhibits than they used to and now in order to have access to anything of real enjoyment you now have to pay (quite a bit more) extra. The enclosures have gotten smaller and the animals seem sadder. It wasn't \u2026",
          "Compared to other zoos this zoo is pretty small and its typically hard to catch all the animals out. It's nice to bring the kiddo to because it is small so it's easy to catch most of the exhibits before he gets too cranky. I'm excited to go back to see the bird exhibit.",
          "It's a good educational zoo in buffalo. But of course as things age they need to be replaced, interactive exhibits slowly over time are destroyed and while not the zoos fault. Should be fixed and or removed as it is left an \"eyesore\". \u2026",

          "Have been going here since the 80s they are always working to improve the animals quality of life. You can easily spend a day here and the food at the beastro is pretty good too. The only thing that I miss is being able to walk through the night houses into the reptile exhibit.",
          "Love it! Small but always a nice visit. Renewed my memebership!",
          "We had a great time here with the kids. The park was clean and the animals seemed to be in good spirit.  \nI wish there were more staff to explain. The animals and their habitats. We also came when the reptiles area was not in operation so that was disappointing but it was still a great day.",
          "Not all the animals were out, but more than last time. Overall B+.",
          "Great community zoo for people of all ages, some areas are a little dated but they are working on rennovations for most of the enclosures!",
          "Was amazed at how many different animals they had at the zoo. Everything from Polar Bears and Snow Leopards (my personal favorite) to Lions and a Rhino. There was a good mix of shade areas with sunny spaces. Also experienced Perry's custard for the first time and loved it. Would recommend this zoo to others.",

          "My first time at Buffalo Zoo and a Zoo period in many years it was a good experience.",
          "Clean, very well-maintained and great views of the animals. Not too busy when we went either. It's on the smaller side in comparison to the Toronto Zoo but I don't think that's a negative, rather it allows one to see the entire zoo without getting tired of walking. Oh and very reasonably priced.",
          "I kept my expectations low going in and still the trip was a disappointment. At least my nieces enjoyed some of it.",

          "Membership no longer includes parking... bogas! No animals were really out and the ones that were are all so bored, miserable and cramped up. Elephants are gone yet the habitat sits. They should expand the exibits and make the park more \u2026",

          "The gorillas enclosure is way to small and they look so sad..  they need a far bigger and equipped for them",
          "Great zoo! There seem to be many animals that aren't seen in other zoos. Everything is very well kept, animals have large habitats and seem to have a great variety of enrichment.  It also seems very historical. I wish they would tell a little bit about the history of zookeeping through the architecture there.",
          "The zoo is a good place for animal viewing, a discount should be offered when while exhibits are closed. We had a wonderful time on our visit it was snowing and the polar bears were having a blast and the kids really loved watching them play. We will always come back at least once a year. The reptile house will be done soon we hope.",
          "too small!! I feel the animals are very unhappy. I've been to many other zoos in other states that are so much bigger where the animals have more room to move. they should really consider moving the zoo to the suburbs and making it at the \u2026",
          "In one aspect, it's good to have a zoo. It's good for the kids, and it's good for some of the animals. However, the Buffalo Zoo is small, it doesn't feel like some of the animals have enough space or that the pens are layed-out well. The staff are mostly very nice, and the handlers are very knowledgeable.",
          "It was terrible no animals were out... No elephants.. One of most large animals. Waist of money",
          "It turned out to be a great day to visit the zoo. Been coming here for over 50 years now. The changes through the years and the changing of the animals. Never been here with my daughter before until today, she is now 30. Better late than never.",
          "My daughter and I just had the best time there, all the animals were active and it was just a very pleasant experience.",
          "I enjoyed my time here. I liked seeing all the animals",
          "It was a beautiful day for a zoo visit and having been to the zoo my whole life I thought I would take my niece on our recent visit to Buffalo.  What a total disappointment.  Not only did the animals look as old as Jesus so did their \u2026",

          "The Buffalo Zoo isn't the biggest zoo, nor does it have the most exotic animals. It is however a great zoo for a nice afternoon stroll with wide pathways, beautiful landscaping, and great viewing areas.  Many improvements have been made to this zoo in recent years, if you haven't been to the zoo recently I would recommend stopping by.",
          "Great small sized zoo making continuous improvement",

          "Is a small zoo but I like it at least was able to see a few  new animals that I hasn't seen previously, sadly I was expecting more from the polar bear area. Even sad because the reptiles area was closed because it was getting remodeling. Perhaps I would visit again next summer.",

          "My daughter contacted me and said the Buffalo Zoo was having a bird exhibit for the summer. Parakeets and cockatiels would fly all over you. We chose a coolish day and made our visit. I had just had surgery, so I needed a walker as I was still weak. But I wanted to see the",
          "My son and daughter and I decided to have a Zoo day. We live between Rochester and Syracuse zoo and having done those before wanted to try some thing different. Based on some of the reviews I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The parking lot was full so had to drive around some and",
          "This is a nice medium-sized zoo for families with younger children. Our 5 and 7 tear old could walk around and lasted about two hours- which let us see and do just about everything. Feeding the parakeets was a highlight for my 7-year old! The polar bear exhibit and the",
          "They did a great job with some of the updates, but still not much to do. They need more interactive things for the kids. And they need better food options, only one small place to eat.",
          "I have visited this zoo several times with my children and grandchildren. Although they have put some funds into the zoo...(and to children its a wonderful place to see live animals) the zoo has taken away the elephants, the big cats are in small enclosures, the park has several",
          "I have been a member of the zoo for at least 20 years. I feel very fortunate to have such a greeat landmark so near. We ride our bike there frequently and participate in many fundraisers. It can be small compared to other zoos, but it is still full of fun!",
          "When my kids were young we had a membership for many years and visited the Buffalo Zoo weekly and always had a fun time. Now that they are older, we only visit about once a year. We visited today and it was quite disappointing. They have fewer animals in many exhibits and some",
          "We live near Erie and we have been to other zoos and I have to say the Buffalo Zoo is an awesome little zoo. Well done exhibits and enclosures for the animals. Very educational as well. May small shows and feeding time which were very well marked. A lot of extra stuff for",
          "Not bad, smaller than I am used to, formerly living In denver, but nice zoo, good time for my young daughter and got ththe famikynpass for a reasonable price. Enjoyable",
          "We live in Buffalo and have a yearly membership to this zoo. It is nice for a half day trip to see the animals. My children, aged 5-9 now, will go often and never get bored. They have made many upgrades to this zoo in the past few years and it shows. It is very clean and the",
          "A well planned zoo in a great park. Easy to get around and see the animals. Not too busy and great for both kids and adults. Reindeer are a bit nuts - but fun. A few African cats I've not seen before too.",
          "Great zoo. Many animal houses have been renovated. New polar bear and eagle exhibits are great to see. Nice leisurely day",
          "all the animals are well cared for, cages are clean and the grounds are well maintained. All on one level so easy access for stroller or wheelchair",
          "Remember seeing the polar bears and peacock when i was a child here and now i bring my own family to see the beautiful creatures. The zoo is well maintained and lots of parking.",
          "The sign at the front gate said it all....lions and tigers off exhibit. The disappointment set in, but we trudged on. Our last visit a couple of years ago had similar exhibits. Welllll, the polar bear stole the show and life at the zoo was good. As usual, it was very clean, and",
          "We go here every other year when visiting family in the area. Very disappointed when we took 6 kids to find that a lot of the attractions were closed up due to renovations and repairs. When paying that much it would be nice to have it mentioned on a site or something. It had",
          "Born and raised in Buffalo, this zoo really hasn't gotten old. We used to frequent when the kids were younger, but just visited last summer for the first time in a few years and they have done a great job of adding to it!",
          "I believe this zoo is the 3rd oldest in the United States. My step son loves it here. Rainforest exhibit is great.",
          "I recently went to the Buffalo Zoo. Had not been there in many years and the improvements made are wonderful. The entrance is now in a new location and it makes you feel like you are going to a real zoo. The new polar bear exhibit is wonderful and so is the Tropical Rain Forest.",
          "Very clean zoo with a lot to see . Definitely would recommend to families. Prices are very reasonable. My grandchildren loved it.",
          "All i can say is it is small and not very impressive. It is proba bbn ly OK for kids and might keep them interested for a while. I felt sorry for one lonely zebra that looked like he or she really wanted a companion. If you do not have kids I would definitively not recommend.",
          "Our family loves our membership at the Buffalo Zoo! Now that we live nearby it is great to walk or bike over. Many think the Zoo is too small, we love it as a place to go regularly.",
          "I hate leaving negative reviews but sometimes it can\u2019t be avoided. This visit cost my family $47.50 for three adults and one child. Taking them to a movie would have been more entertaining and engaging. Many of the animals were not able to be seen as they were not in their",
          "In the Buffalo area recently and decided to visit the Buffalo Zoo. It is a smaller zoo but we had a good time. It was rather warm but did see most of the exhibits. Clean & friendly.",
          "We tempted our 8-year old to patience with our Frank Lloyd Wright House tour 2 blocks away - by promising him the zoo afterwards. Don't have to return to the car - parking for one is close enough for both - and the zoo really caters to kids with fun exhibits, play areas and not",
          "this zoo is a hidden gem, that don't have the right publicity person. not enough tv spots, it needs to be a bit better publicised, its one of buffalo's crown jewels if you lie nearby, you should definitely get an annual pass, well worth the money.",
          "This is a relatively small zoo so it is easy for a quick trip. We spent about 2 1/2 hours and were able to make it through all of the exhibits and take plenty of photographs. We found the zoo to be very clean and nicely maintained. Parking was easy - be prepared to pay $5.00",
          "We were in the Buffalo area and needed something to do for the kiddos for the day. While this is a nice zoo, it is not a day trip, more like two hours max. It is small but cost friendly. We weren't able to see the lion or tiger and some of the exhibits were closed for repairs.",
          "Beautiful zoo. Very clean, lots to see. Lots of walking. My grandchildren had lots of fun. My family certainly will go back again.",
          "Buffalo Zoo is Amazing it\u2019s very clean and I try to go to Zoo\u2019s In every city I go to just to see them.",
          "Silverback Gorillas we\u2019re feeding. Playful Polar Bears were tumbling in the water. A tiger licking its chops. Rhinos wallowing in the watery pit. So many animals, so little time. Come to the Buffalo Zoo. You won\u2019t be disappointed and adults can have fun too.",
          "Just visited the zoo last week. It is a small zoo, but has a good amount of animals. You can spend 2 hours and see the whole thing . I went late in the day but still enjoyed it and would go back again. The lions and tigers were very active, but the polar bears were sleeping.",
          "For a small space, the zoo is well organised. We saw many different animals, and feed the birds with a seed stick. The only slight disappointment was the closure of the reptile house when we visited.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo, located in Delaware Park, is a nice way to spend a few hours, especially if you have kids. While on the small size, they have a large variety of animals. Ticket prices are affordable. They charge for parking, but I recommend parking in Delaware Park for free and",
          "Nice zoo, easy layout for a nice outdoor walk for both adults and children. On a nice day with school trips it was spacious and pleasant. It has a nice variety of animals. We really enjoyed our time there. It was the perfect way to break up a road trip.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo used to be pitifully maintained but in recent years they have added several new and updated exhibits which have greatly improved the experience. The rainforest building and polar bear exhibits are my favorite upgrades.",
          "While visiting Toronto from Buffalo my wife and I went to the Buffalo Zoo. We loved it. First of all, the price is very affordable. And being an older style zoo (albeit with many upgraded exhibits) it meant little walking between exhibits. This lets you in only a few hours",
          "Inexpensive, easy to get to. The displays are very interactive and the animals were very energetic while we were there.",
          "I was surprised to see the amount of animals they had. It was still cold and lots of exhibits were closed. The animals look thin . Was kind of depressing . Must be that I have not visited a Zoo in a while . The rainforest was nice and the lady\u2019s at the 2 exhibits were very nice.",
          "This is the first zoo that I went to that left me feeling extremely sad for the animals. The worst part was visiting the gorilla enclosure. One of many enclosures that were extremely small. The one gorilla laid on it's back, staring at the ceiling. Occasionally, he would do side",
          "We always have a great time. Not too big for little legs. Able to spend the day and see it all. Very clean and well cared for.",
          "We visited the zoo on a day with 50 mph winds and sub-freezing temperatures. Except for two other visitors, we had the place to ourselves. The sea lion and polar bear areas were great. Unlike many zoos, even though they had a lot of room, the animals were very visible. The",
          "An amazing selection of animals including all of the large ones like elephants and giraffes. I especially enjoyed the collection of reptiles",
          "In February the Buffalo Zoo offers a $5 admission fee and parking is free. The animals were active in the cool weather and it was a nice day to do something outside when often feeling a little house bound in winter. The polar bears were especially fun to watch as the came right",
          "Wasn\u2019t impressed. My son (11) and I like to visit zoos in cities while we wait for the girls to cheer (All-Stars). We\u2019ve never been to the Buffalo zoo, but being from the Finger Lakes region, I know many who have gone and speak very highly of this zoo. Conditions: Sunday",
          "We visited here last September. We love zoos, and we thought this was a very good one. It's not a huge zoo, but it has a good variety of animals inhabitants. It was not crowded the day we visited, and we got to see everything up close and at a leisurely pace. Highlights were",
          "We visited the zoo along with some of our friends during the Family Day weekend in Canada. The weather was 10C so it was not too cold to be outside. The day we went, they had a promotion of $5 entry for all ages and parking was free as well, which was a big treat for all the",
          "Though this zoo is not large, there are so many sights to see. Winter is a great time for activity - animals enjoying the cool and not hiding from the heat. You can spend an hour or a day and things are always improving with time and funding. It was awesome to witness families",
          "So to be fair we paid $5 and a lot of animals were off exhibit but the amount of smokers is discouraging and there is s lack of good signage to tell more about animals. We stopped in a cafe to warm up and didn\u2019t buy food but greasy! Smelling. Sad elephant exhibit.",
          "Been many times over the years and it was supposed to have improved! It was a great disappointment.There is not very much to do compared to other zoos we have visited. Not many animals to view. On the plus side it does have a great rainforest indoors ! The rainforest had plenty",
          "We had an AWESOME time! We were down for the day from across the pond and looking for stuff to do. My boyfriend looked at me like I was nuts when I suggested the zoo. But it was $5 admission and free parking, and on a sunny February day it couldn't have been better. It's a",
          "For the size of the zoo the animal selection was ok.... their were a lot of empty exhibits when we visited. It was disappointing because I went to see the polar bears and we didn\u2019t see one of them.",
          "Great place to visit even in the winter. No parking fee and reduced admission costs. Girl Scouts had a party with pizza, pop and visits from furry animals. Our host was perfect. They learned about chinchillas and ferrets. They also had an opportunity to pet them. Walking",
          "For a small zoo there is plenty to do. In every season our kids have had a great time - the indoor displays are excellent, the big animals seem well-cared for, plus rides for the little ones.",
          "Wonderful elephant walk the plank best ever, so children friendly and details for them to learn and have fun",
          "We had the time to visit the zoo while visiting family in Buffalo. What a nice place for a city the size of Buffalo. There were a number of children there which made it quite enjoyable as we watched their excitement seeing the animals.",
          "The zoo is a wonderful family activity. It's a great size for walking around for a couple of hours without being overwhelming. I especially enjoy the rain-forest building - it feels very realistic.",
          "A reasonably priced and easy to get to zoo is a great attraction for families. The exhibits are fairly close together so it is an easy walk. One can just go for a quick visit or stay the entire day. The elephant pavilion is a favourite.",
          "I have always lived in buffalo and only been to the zoo a handful of times, once i had my girls i made it a point to get a membership ... we go all the time . Even if its just an hr or half day. With the family package we can take there oma and papa and its such a fun day. So",
          "My boyfriend and I love this zoo. We have been 3 years in a row. We come from Canada each year. Lots to see without alot of walking inbetween which is nice.",
          "The Buffalo zoo is a great place any time of year. My most recent visit was ape I am as we arrived just in time for the gorilla feeding. I recommend finding out when the animals get fed, as they are especially fun to watch at those times. The red panda was also fun to see. I",
          "My husband and I decided to spend a sunny morning at the zoo. Growing up I always enjoyed going to see the animals and their habitat. I especially loved the gorillas, elephants and tigers. What surprised me was you were no longer able to go inside to view them. You could look",
          "My daughter gets a season family pass every year for her birthday from her grandparents....and we use it!!! We love going in the winter when it is cooler and there are less people. But I have to say, we have been twice now during large events and I was shocked at how smoothly",
          "Kids attention span, and honestly mine, is 2 hours. So in 2 hours or less you can leisurely view just about everything. We love it!",
          "This zoo is a real treasure situated in the heart of the Parkside neighborhood within the Olmsted Parks system and near the Darwin Martin House. It's the perfect size for a young child to walk & explore indoors and outdoors (even without a stroller)! The animal exhibits are",
          "The Buffalo zoo is not nearly as impressive/extensive as the Toronto zoo, but it is cheaper, less crowded, and in my opinion, a more enjoyable place to spend a few hours with the kids. The grounds are beautiful, and so is the location. We especially enjoyed the Gorillas and the",
          "The Buffalo zoo offers lots of events for kids which is great, and is open year round! I believe it is reduced or free entry in the winter months.",
          "My daughter and her husband took the day off Monday which was her birthday to go to the Buffalo zoo. It is less than 2 hours from where we live. They asked my husband and I if we would like to join them. We arrived around 11 on a beautiful fall morning, not a cloud in the",
          "The polar bear was very active - . Very playful I enjoyed all of the animals. I highly recommend if you are in the area.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a great zoo to visit. Shaded on a warm day, lots of interesting animals to see. It is easy to get to, plenty of parking and just a great way to spend a few hours.",
          "Three of us visited yesterday on a gorgeous day. We didn't have kids with us, but we encourage all those visiting the area to definitely bring your kids. You will need at least two hours, probably no more. Parking is very easy and $5.00 just out of the entrance door. There",
          "Nice visit ,beautiful zoo. Nice staff, awesome animals.. we went for work. Brought some of our handicapped residents 3 of them whom are in wheel chairs, whom all loved it . It was nice that it was handicap accessible. Nice gift shop..",
          "I have been many times over the years as I lived in Buffalo my whole life from going as A kid myself to taking my kids and the grand kid I have watched it grow over the years and get better with time and it seams no mater what the age you still love it they do a great job and I",
          "clean zoo awesome day price is affordable.. the exhibits are very clean and easy to see. many hands on things for children to do.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a great place to take your kids when you're in the area. They have a plethora of species to see, and they've done a nice job making the place family-friendly, to include a dinosaur-bone dig area and a carousel. It's not too big where it becomes a chore to",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a great zoo to hold the interest of children, ages five and nine. They asked to visit the barn and the rain forest is a must visit. We enjoyed the antics of the polar bears and the sea lions. The zoo has so many animals that I am sure we missed a few but we",
          "This zoo has a nice variety of animals. It is laid out in a concise manner for easy viewing. The children always love coming here.",
          "I am always wary of visiting zoos, because I often wind up feeling sorry for the animal being penned up. The Buffalo Zoo has fairly roomy accommodations for the animals, with indoor and outdoor portions for the larger animals. The zoo is nicely laid out, and while fairly",
          "Went on Sunday there was a lot of families the weather was awesome. The good thing is you can see all the different animals and get some exercise also.",
          "It is a nice zoo that is not too large, but I think some of the enclosures are too small for small of the animals. On the whole, good day trip.",
          "I love the zoo, I've been to large and small ones around the country. This one is definitely in the middle category. Even without the most extensive animal collection, this little zoo packs a lot of education, entertainment, and enjoyment into its Delaware Park setting. I",
          "We loved the buffalo zoo! Not too much distance to travel and a great variety of animals to see! Parking is a fee. We got a discount for being zoo members in another city. The gorillas and the sea lions were highlights!",
          "Very nice zoo.. we tacked on a stop here when visiting Niagara Falls. Glad we did. The kids loved it. It's kind of in the middle of town, but not the of the city. Overall, would visit again.",
          "As a smaller city, Buffalo doesn't have the budget for as impressive zoos as cities like Toronto or Dallas, but they do have some good exhibits. Despite the heat outside, the polar bears were pretty active.",
          "This isn't a huge zoo -a s in - not Bronx Zoo size - but it is I think a perfect half day size. Also the layout is really nice with areas kind of separated by playground area, carousel, dinosaur dig, hedges and flowers. I went with my husband and sons and we didn't have a half",
          "Very well laid out zoo with many interesting animals, including elephants and lions. The exhibits were well maintained and you could see the animals very easily. Great for all ages.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo has changed...and it's GREAT! There are so many things to do inside, and the kids had a blast. It was really engaging. Our kids (wide age range) each had such a good time. If you haven't been in a while, give the new and improved Zoo a try!",
          "We recently visited this zoo with family that was in town. We enjoyed looking at the zoo, although it was small. We were surprised at how many animals were out, considering how hot it was. When we ate lunch, we ordered a cheeseburger, fry and drink each. While the price was",
          "2nd time to the zoo and still enthusiastic when I was there. I was looking forward to seeing the arctic fox this year as it was under construction last year. I was amazed by the rainforest this time as there was feeding time hence kids can learn more. Information Parking fee:",
          "The exhibits are not huge, but allow for amazingly close feeling encounters. The mixture of clear glass barriers and open air fencing allow a variety of experiences. My 5 and 7 year old were both equally engaged but not exhausted after a full visit. The attached park allows for",
          "Well maintained place with lots of animals taken care well by the staffs. There are places to relax and enjoy the peaceful environment as well. Polar bears and snake parks are the good addition recently. Lovely place to be with family especially with kids .",
          "The Buffalo zoo is a great place to bring a family. It is worth getting a membership so that you can go often for shorter periods of time. There have been a fair number of recent improvements to the zoo, really nice smaller exhibits.",
          "We have lived in Buffalo for over 30 years and the zoo has always been a destination. We haven't been for awhile and took our granddaughter there in November. It was a crisp day but not frigid and we expected a crowd but were amazed that the zoo was pretty desolate. Better for",
          "The zoo is pretty big and it has a lot to offer, however most animals were hiding when we went. Perhaps because it was an extremely hot day. My kids still had a good time. One negative aspect was that you had to buy tokens at the food court or the front entrance before going",
          "Visited the zoo on our way home from Niagara Falls. The zoo is small, but quite lovely. The gorilla exhibit was quite nice.",
          "Recently had family in town and made a half day trek to the zoo. It was great! So many childhood memories and stories of the zoo before all the improvements. We were lucky the day was beautiful weather wise, and we're able to see almost everything we wanted. The rain forest",
          "This zoo is really nice. We walked around and saw many animals and lots of beautiful landscaping. Lots of animals were out and about but what I really like is that the animals have some hiding spots so that they can get away from the human observers if they choose to. They care",
          "We had so much fun at the Buffalo Zoo. The zoo is clean and very well kept! The kids had a lot of fun! We didn't see the polar bears but that's ok it is probably too hot for them to be out. We saw a lot of animals. Our favorites are the elephants and the sea lions! Also the 5",
          "The Buffalo Zoo continues to improve and it is never boring to take children and watch their excitement. I find it to alway clean, their food is reasonably priced and the people that work there must enjoy their jobs because they are all very friendly.",
          "Very nice, spread out. Great for kids. We didn't have any with us. Good to support them, though. The big cats need more space, as do the elephants, among others. They have the room, guess the need the money. A worthy charity!",
          "It is clear that the Buffalo Zoo has invested in their animals and patrons. Several exhibits were beautiful and new including elements of technology and interactivity for children and adults of all ages. In the last three years we've been to the Buffalo Zoo, the Toronto Zoo,",
          "It was very disappointing to take a trip to the zoo expecting to see animals and see nothing but empty exhibits. We heard there was a new Polar bear exhibit but there were no Polar bears. There are no bears of any kind at the Buffalo zoo. No cats of any kind, no lions, no",
          "This zoo is trying very hard to improve their exhibits. I grew up in Buffalo and remember tight enclosures for the animals. The zoo has made improvements to the enclosures and added space. They have also added to the variety of animals. The playground and carousel is tired and",
          "The buffalo zoo is wonderful for little children. It is very interesting seeing the animals. My biggest thing is it is slightly overpriced. All in all it is pretty fun.",
          "The zoo is a wonderful place to visit. Having been to other zoos it was a surprise as to how fast we were able to do the whole facility: about 2 hours. Nonetheless we had a great time and the kids were thrilled to see their favorite animals.",
          "I love the Buffalo Zoo. It may not be as large as Toronto or Queens, but at literally a fraction of the price (parking is $3 rather than $25 and adult entrance is $12 rather than $35+). There is a large variety or animals in very nice exhibits and enclosures. Unlike larger",
          "We live the Buffalo zoo being one of the oldest in America it's heritage you know and lots to see and fun for kids the inside observatory is amazing the whole place it's fun!",
          "If it wasn't for the play areas, the zoo would get a 2. I found the layout a bit hard to follow....maybe arrows or the map showing a path to follow to see everything. I felt like we were passing stuff we already saw but missing other things. (May have been easier if you don't",
          "Very fun (and inexpensive) activity for families. My kids range in age and they were all happy here! Great way to get the kids outside and off devices while visiting their grandparents.",
          "I've been to the Buffalo zoo twice in the last year and wasn't overly impressed either time. It's costly to get it in and parking is at a premium in the area. There is only one entrance to the zoo which is inconvenient. The animals are fine but aren't always out or active. I",
          "We went this past weekend, took our son, I like the fact they do t chlorinate the water for the animals! Koodos for that! Overall I would say we enjoyed our visit, but we were disappointed by the many of exhibits where we did not see the animals. It was warm on Sunday,",
          "we like the distribution and is a middle size Zoo, but there was many exhibitions empties some areas are under renovation but, others do not have any animal to show, the weather was not cold or hot to not have the animals on display, we really like the polar bears",
          "My husband and I took our one year old here. He had a great time walking around and seeing all the animals. Not big enough for him or us to get lost. They have rhinos giraffes elephants lions tigers the rain forest exhibit is really neat. Lots of birds etc. we would go again. I",
          "One is the loneliest number, and the Buffalo zoo has a lot of exhibits with lonely animals pacing in there cramped cages. One of those dated zoos that should be shut down. There are some new exhibits, but still only a handful of animals to see. The zoo doesn't even have a",
          "The zoo itself was not very big, and did not take ua long to get through. The nice thing was we had good views of the animals. I have been to some zoos that their habitat made it very difficult to see the animal, but here there were no issues. I wish it was a little bigger,",
          "It is an old zoo, and one that should be shut down. The exhibits are data, with the exception of a few new installations. The elephants and giraffs need to me moved to more humane settings. There are often single animals in the exhibits, so they have not social exposure to other",
          "Pretty good zoo. Animals seem healthy and well cared for. Admission price was fair and food and souvenir prices were the norm for the type of location.",
          "wonderful family outing to see nature and a wide assortment of animals, I would recommend for 2 to 3 hours",
          "I've been here several times now with my wife and daughter. The admission fee is very reasonable, there are some cool exhibits as well. Would highly recommend to anyone with children in the area.",
          "We always make a stop when in the area to visit family. This zoo is one of our favorites and our family has special memories here. The zoo is always very clean and they have excellent staff who are willing to serve and assist. If you have little ones they will love a ride on",
          "We love to watch the polar bears and tigers. They each put on a good show. Lions are usually sedate, but once in awhile we have heard the roar. Love that sound! This is our field trip zoo and I have watched all the improvements they have made over the years. Field trip times",
          "Seems like nothing ever changes there and start to finish 45 mins at most.Good if you have never been there before .",
          "Went to the zoo with family and found it to be a very pleasant experience. It's been about 15 years since I've been to the Buffalo Zoo and saw many changes such as the artic exhibit & rain forest.",
          "This is not the zoo of many years ago! All the new exhibits are fantastic. This is a must see destination when visiting Buffalo. Clean, helpful staff and the price is right for a full day of exploring and fun.",
          "I grew up close to Buffalo and have visited the zoo since I was small. I've always loved animals and the Buffalo Zoo definitely helped with my fascination. While on the smaller size, the staff has done an amazing job at renovating the habitats to provide the best natural",
          "Coming from the Toronto area, my family with 2 little girls aged 5 and 7 had a delightful experience at this zoo. About 1/3 the price of our zoo in Toronto (not including exchange on Candadian money). The 3rd oldest zoo in America, the exhibits are easy to access and enjoy.",
          "Took my family there over the weekend. Not a big zoo at all but not too small. The highlight was definitely the polar bears. The zoo can be seen in approximately two hours, so it's not an all day thing perfect to go early in the morning before kids naps.",
          "The zoo is an amazing place. If you haven't been for a time, you will be amazed by the habitats provided. I especially love the tropical rainforest! Membership is a great value and pays for itself after just a few visits. I have Individual Plus. That allows me unlimited",
          "Fantastic zoo to spend time with children. 1-2 hours is enough to observe every corner of the zoo. Children really likes this place. You better vizit zoo as often as possible, because some exhibition's are closed. If you buy full year access card you'll get free parking tickets.",
          "This zoo is a bit on the smaller side, but don't let that keep you away! We went in the off season, and I'd absolutely recommend this. We are people who don't love crowds, but do love getting up close and personal with the animals. The exhibits at this zoo are really well",
          "Just like many older zoos in the US it really doesn't have wide open spaces. The lions, addax and rhinos seem to have very little room to roam around. The giraffes were indoors in very small spaces. The polar bears and the gorillas seem to have a bit more room. It just seems",
          "I haven't been to the zoo in years, no particular reason, just not happening. Luckily two friends invited me to join them on a sunny day and off we went! It brought back great memories of my trips here with kids and the funny things that animals do! I especially enjoyed the",
          "For Buffalo, this should be a bigger and more exciting place to visit. Great for young children but beyond that age it would be a bit boring.",
          "Although I get sad seeing large animal in small enclosures, the Buffalo Zoo has been doing a wonderful job over the past few years making renovations and changes to the environment and the animal's habitats. The best new feature is Arctic Edge where the polar bears are kept. It",
          "This zoo has been upgrading over the years and do an excellant job for the small area they have and the age of the zoo. The animals are well cared for and a nice experience",
          "We go to the Buffalo Zoo almost every year; Perfect size for a family; Great exhibits; Wonderful staff;",
          "This Zoo was very nice. As a matter of fact, we almost had the entire Zoo to ourselves due to visiting in Winter. I found it to be well designed other than the fact I thought the enclosures for some of the larger animals was a bit small. I would recommend a visit to this Zoo",
          "I've been renewing my yearly pass for 7 years. They offer birthday parties that are personal and thrilling for kids. My son and I have been visiting Luna the polar bear since she was born and we're sad when her twin, Kali, got sent to another zoo. We've made it a tradition to",
          "Really, REALLY impressed with the changes here at the zoo. Someone, and my guess is Donna Fernandes, deserves a TON of credit for the updates.Great late winter Sunday to enjoy the zoo. Sunny, cold which kept the crowds down. Polar Bears so visible and active. And the gorillas !",
          "Although it is small zoo, it is very good, u can see the animal very close, and they have animals exotics as capybars.",
          "I have not been to the zoo in about 20 years and the new exhibits are wonderful. The polar bears are awesome and I especially love the rain forest. Nice job.",
          "What better than Nature? All shapes & sizes! Reminds us of our wonderful & fragile existence! Go! Take the Kids, Take the Grandparents and most of all, take yourself to the Zoo!",
          "It's a Zoo, mixed emotions! There is a lot to see; special for children to see the animals up close! Truly, a Great experience! Watching the kids expressions live, NO COMPARISON, as seeing animals on TV! Coupons available in the local books, too.",
          "This small but highly accredited zoo is fabulous! With a wide variety of animals it is easy to see their focus is on conservation. Among their animals they have two rescued sea lions, two rescued bald eagles and rescued Arctic fox. They have a fantastic conservation exhibit",
          "A great place to visit for all ages to experience wildlife any time of year. Both indoor and outdoor exhibits and many endangered species.",
          "I have a multicolored highly carved made in Mexico. In two separate visits to the zoo I displayed my cane and the polar bear in residence immediately came over to glass where I stood.. They pressed their up against the glass when I placed the cane up against it. They followed",
          "Great things to do in Buffalo, both with kids and without them. We have also seen the Frank Lloyd Wright house, just not recently",
          "We were looking for something different to do this past New Year's Day, so the sun was out and we thought a walk through the Buffalo Zoo would be fun. We weren't wrong. Winter is a great time to check out the zoo. Most of the animals were out enjoying the sun and brisk",
          "Visited the buffalo zoo today and had an amazing time, had never been before but will definitely recommend it to family and friends. Loved how interactive the exhibits were and seeing the animals!",
          "What a wonderful little zoo Buffalo has! Having visited many zoos over the years, this one had been on my Life List for some time, and I was not disappointed. It is very clean, the animals are extremely well cared for, and there is a nice variety for all kinds of animal",
          "It's coming together but still needs more work. Better than it use to be 15 yrs ago and my children enjoy it! Rain Forest is great!",
          "They have over 1200 animals on 23.5 acres. Lion cubs are a delight. Gorillas are worth watching for hours. All animals are very well cared for.",
          "We bring our kids when visiting our parents. It is very easy to navigate and a solid selection of animals to visit. This is a great family attraction.",
          "Mr monkey man was so cute smelly n full of life the moment he saw me he blue kisses and hugs the tree breaking the branches as he came tumbling down he then got up n blew me a kiss rite on my head i was so happy-go-lucky",
          "First off zoos are depressing, aspects of this maybe more so than other zoos. The elephants in particular seem like they are in close quarters. Worth going if you have kids or for a fairly inexpensive afternoon for a couple. You can walk through everything at a leisurely",
          "10 members of my family visited the zoo last fall and we all had a great time. Our crew was aged from 92 to 2 1/2 and we all found our favorite animal of the day. The walking was a challenge for some members of our group but there was adaquate places to sit and rest. We",
          "This is a nice small zoo that is easy to see in a half day. They have made some good positive improvements, which is nice to see. We got there two days before the new polar bear was officially introduced and he was already putting on a show. Always a pleasure to see their",
          "We have been there to celebrate one of the child's bday, the zoo was pleasant and good. It has very lass number of animals/creatures. Not so exited, but can be a quick tour with lil children.",
          "I love visiting zoos but was a little disappointed with the Buffalo Zoo. Some of the enclosures are too small for the animals. The zoo is updating and growing a bit each year so hopefully it will get better.",
          "Saddest zoo in the entire world. I can't believe how small some of the areas are. WE NEED MORE SPACE!",
          "You can tell the zoo is definitely trying to get things done with new exhibits. They have quite a ways to go but are on the right track despite a county budget. Rainforest exhibit is nice. I would have liked to see more consistency with their invertebrate exhibits. The new",
          "We attend the zoo several times a year. They have great exhibits - many recently added or updated. They also have knowledgeable staff often giving presentations throughout the zoo.",
          "This is a nice size zoof, easy to cover in a few hours with kids in tow.Our favorites are the polar bears and gorillas. We saw the newest baby gorilla the first days after it was born. One of the polar bears is so interactive coming right up to the glass and looking at you. Such",
          "It is such a great zoo, that is bigger than you think & has many different small & big animals. Not only does it have buffalos, but it also has gorillas, monkeys, lemurs & much more.",
          "This is a small zoo nestled in the heart of the city with very limited space to expand. In recent years improvements/new build exhibits have been made to improve the guest experience and the welfar of the animals. The problem is there are no animals to fill these exhibits for",
          "I liked that the animals could get very close to us. Although it's a smallish zoo, they had a good variety of animals.",
          "We went here with our 3 kids 7 8 9 they all loved it. The entrance fee does seem a little pricey it reminded me of our zoo in Minnesota that is free. I would recommend finding coupons to get in first. We had some buy one get one coupons from entertainment book. I do feel like",
          "I absolutely loved this zoo. Not extremely large, but not small either. Lots of interesting animals. Elephants were very interesting. Loved the Gorillas and babies. Watched for over an hour. Went off season so it was not crowded. Rhino was funny. Lions, reptiles and",
          "- This is the second time I visited the Buffalo Zoo in two years and it was just as good the second time around. - There is a lot of walking but the zoo is laid out in a very good manner so you don't miss anything. - This is the second time I tried to see the tiger though but",
          "We had a great time at the zoo and the baby lion cubs were really fun to see especially as they played with each other and with their parents.",
          "This zoo may not be the biggest zoo in the world but it makes up for it with charm that's for sure! The character from the old buildings is just wonderful! It's a very easy walk so definitely good for people with mobility issues as well as small children. The Giant Anteater was",
          "I have been to the Buffalo Zoo so many times I can't keep track. We started going when my kids were young. Great venue for little ones. They can walk the entire zoo without getting tired and everything is clean and safe. Never had to worry about them getting too far, that I",
          "Would not recommend...too small..animals seem miserable...elephants should be in a sanctuary not here in buffalo where they don't have the room they need...tigers sway back and forth which is a disorder...Sad! That's the best word to describe this zoo!",
          "I've only been to the zoo a couple times before so I'm not super knowledgable or picky on these things, but I enjoyed my time here. My favourite part was the lion cubs. My wife and me were lucky enough to see the mom nursing them a couple feet away from us which was an awesome",
          "We decided to take a trip on the thruway to check out a zoo a little farther from home. We should have stayed home the buildings and exhibits are small and outdated. We enjoy the Rochester zoo far better. The zebra and giraffes were cool but I could have passed on everything",
          "$12 to get in we had a coupon for a dollar off. My 20 yr old daughter and i went. The new things are great, the Rainforest, birds flying next to u, the 1 and only polar bear has a great area, the fox 2 babies and mom were cute in the polar bear area. Otter area was new last time",
          "We are big zoo folks and visit the zoo whenever we go someplace on vacation. We live between buffalo and rochester and visit the buffalo zoo twice as often as the rochester zoo... even in the winter, there is enough enclosed exhibits that it is enjoyable",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is growing by leaps & bounds, updating & adding new attractions. You might have heard of the polar bear cub on the news. They run specials during the year & it's a great place to spend an afternoon with your children or grand-kids. Besides being educational, it's",
          "Several vendors all types of food, wine, speciality beers, food, games. Benefit the zoo non profit. Seating and handicap accessable. Wine tasting, every vendor you can imagine. Kid friendly. Must go and experience zoo at normal times.",
          "This was a good experience for me. I always have some reservations about zoos, but this one was great, very clean and well maintained. I enjoyed my visit here",
          "The new Artic exhibit that was added in 2015 is a great hands on experience for children and adults alike. We enjoyed the interactive experiences provided throughout the zoo.",
          "We have young children so this Zoo is a great size. Just enough Zoo without everyone ending up totally exhausted. I liked how easy it was to view the animals. It seems very well designed. It's flat so extremely easy to navigate with a stroller. We loved the rhino, polar bear,",
          "I always have mixed feelings about zoos, and usually leave feeing bad for the animals. This zoo had a nice blend of education and good enclosures for the animals. It was a good size to do in a few hours. More hands on activities for little children would have been nice.",
          "We visited the zoo on a Friday in September. There were no animal encounters, no petting, no rides. The seals, tigers and polar bears were having a day off and a bunch of others enclosures were also empty. They had no problem, however charging full price for the entrance and",
          "Once again we took the family and all the Grand-children to the Zoo on a gorgeous August day. Once again, there was major construction going on, animals had been sent out to another zoo and the others managed to successfully play hid-and-seek from all of us. We did manage to see",
          "Now that my children have grown I have not been to the Zoo in at least 10 years. My husband and I spent an afternoon there and were pleasantly surprised with all of the improvements that have been made. There are many new exhibits, It is such an improvement over the old Zoo. We",
          "Nicely designed Zoo with a fairly broad selection of mammals and reptiles. Great place to have some fun while you learn how to help protect and conserve endangered species. Nice concessions and bathrooms - good set up for young children and elderly. We enjoyed seeing the new",
          "We have a membership it pays for it self time and time again! Every Time we go we get to spend more time with different animals. Sometimes it is the lions and there Cubs other times the polar bears some time the otters or sea lions monkeys... Regardless it is a great way to",
          "I'm impressed with the newly built areas such as the polar bear exhibit. Buffalo zoo is a must stop at least once per year to enjoy what they have to see. Great kids areas! Enjoyed lunch at their cafe.",
          "It has been a long time since I have been here. I just happened to be given a free guest pass value of $12.00 admission. We chose one of the hottest days to go. With that being said, many of the animals were not out for viewing. The lady at the gate was pleasant offering us a",
          "The zoo is designed with kids in mind. The exhibits have excellent viewing at all levels and highlight the best of the animals. There are plenty of rest areas between exhibits and interactive things for the kids to get out some energy doing.",
          "We have 5 children all under 9yrs old and have been to several zoos. This one is our top favorite. I would highly recommend this zoo to anyone",
          "The Zoo is not very big. The attractions are few but they are well looked after and appear to be healthy. There are Gorillas, Giraffes, Wallabies, Reindeers, Lions, Hyenas and Rhinoceros. Lot of reptiles abound. The typical zoo smell is absent. The approach to the Zoo is",
          "The carousel and the trackless train are my son's favorite. The sea lions are always active and the seal is always honking/barking. The elephant and gorillas can be kind of depressing since they are indoors.",
          "Our date night, turned into a date day with my husband and I. Went to the Buffalo Zoo after decades. Last time I was the I was just a kid. It's had many upgrades since then and is still a great zoo. Word of advice get coupons for admission and don't drink the water.",
          "We have now visited this zoo 3 times while in Buffalo. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this zoo. There is not a tremendous amount of things to look at but what is there is well worth going for. The animal pens are kept VERY clean and tidy. The animals all seem to be up close and personal. The",
          "We had a short tour here and it was kind of ok, the variety of animals is pretty small although some parts of the zoo were empty of animals probably bc it's a off season, overall I would recommend this place for parents with kids but not for adults between 20-30 The cost of",
          "I think the thing I like most about the Buffalo Zoo is that you get pretty close to the animals. The animals all look happy and healthy and it is a very clean environment. We have enjoyed going to the Buffalo Zoo many times and it seems there is something new each time we go.",
          "Love all the animals and shows how amazing that there's a polar bear and more winter animals,there are ocean animals and desert animals we loved it",
          "We moved to Buffalo a couple years ago and took our 1 year old for the first time. It was mostly a disappointment. Many of the exhibits didn't have animals present (not sleeping/hiding, just closed) and the \"petting farm\" was the biggest disappointment since our little one is",
          "The Buffalo Zoological Gardens is always full of surprises. New exhibits , new babies, friendly employees who are quick to share their knowledge with you. We always enjoy our visit .sometimes it is a quick two hours .Other times , we can spend an entire day. Weather is no",
          "During our recent visit to the zoo, we were quite pleased with the amount of viewing areas provided to see the animals from multiple view points. The Zoo staff were friendly and welcoming. The animal exhibits were well maintained and not overgrown. We live in Ohio and attempt",
          "Well maintained, with many habitat areas vs. cages. Guest Gorilla and lion habitat...fun place to take whole family",
          "The zoo had a great variety of animals and nice exhibits but I didn't feel like we saw many of the animals. We had great views of sea lions and a polar bear. It was hard to escape the bees that seemed to be swarming everywhere!",
          "I have been to this zoo alot & every time I go somthing is either getting process of either being updated or something is being taken out. The kids have a playground, Farris wheel& sand box area , so maybe they can make a few friends while spending the day @ the zoo. It can",
          "So I used to work in the Education Department during high school and part of college over 25 years ago. I was excited to be back in town for a visit. Despite the nonexistent signage directing you around the grounds I found my way around from memory. Several exhibits have",
          "I thought that the zoo was a little cramped. I was sorry to see that so many animals were off exhibit. So many of the outdoor exhibits were so overgrown with grass and weeds. The zoo is not marked very well as to were to go next. The playground was very nice. The fountain was",
          "We had a great time! Beautiful zoo! Wish we got there earlier to explore the grounds more. We especially loved the polar bear. We missed the seal lion show and other demos but we will Definitely will go again!",
          "The zoo is quite affordable, and is a very compact layout which is great for the visitors and small children, but probably not appreciated (nor likely realized) by the animals in the very small confines.",
          "My wife and I are avid zoo goers so when we read the Buffalo Zoo was the third oldest in the US, we knew we had to visit while staying in Niagara Falls. It was a short easy drive to the US. Rather inexpensive for being located in the middle of the city it was easy to locate and",
          "After spending the morning by the water, we decided to spend the afternoon at the zoo. We literally closed the place. It was quite a wonderful zoo and very affordable. Put it on your list of 1/2 day sights to see in Buffalo.",
          "I am an avid animal lover so of course I loved seeing the animals.THe price of the zoo wasnt bad but paid 4.00 to park in the parking lot.The zoo has definately gotten better over the years.Even thouh we were handed a map at the beginning it would have been nice to have signs",
          "I move around a lot and have been to many zoos big, small, and this one is absolutely one of the best zoos I have ever been too. Although it did have some not so great things. Your only aloud to see most of the elephants 2 days a week The shows are not really shows there more",
          "Could not have been more disappointed in the zoo overall. Although it's improved with some of the new exhibits (would have been a 0 otherwise), there is no way the zoo does the animals any favors. They're lethargic and in areas way too small for them. I've been to many zoos and",
          "Very nice zoo with many animals to see. Can park on streets but does have a parking lot, i used the lot. Staff very helpful and Knowledgeable. Not a large zoo but not a small zoo either.",
          "The brake up of the main building mad it really hard to get around. Many of the animals were not on display during the middle of the day. Making a 2 day pass would be well worth it. I would pay extra to visit half the zoo at a time so kids won't get grumpy and tired.",
          "The elephants were closed. That was the one animal our child kept asking about. Baby lion cubs were nice. Very small zoo. Nice activities for little kids. A puppet show (was very hard to hear tho) and a sea lion training even tho the sea lion was uncooperative. I thought it",
          "Been coming to this zoo for over 40 years n always good. Perfect size zoo where u see all the animals up close n don't have to walk miles, like many over priced zoos like San Diego. The price is also on point and won't empty the wallet. I love the fact it's one of the oldest",
          "The new polar bear exhibit is great and we've appreciated the newer sea lion and river otter exhibits over the last couple of years. The rainforest exhibit is lots of fun and exciting to be inside and feel like you're in the rainforest! Large grounds are peaceful and enjoyable.",
          "We had time to kill before visiting the Darwin Martin House, so we walked down the street to the Zoo. While some of the exhibits were interesting, the Zoo was nothing really special.",
          "Getting better and better. Gives children an appreciation for animals they might not ever see. Well taken care of grounds and animals and changing as we speak. We travel the world seeing zoos and this zoo is right up there with what we have seen.",
          "I have been coming to this zoo for about 40 years. I liked it when it was this simple, free and brief stop when I was a kid. It has now be come a very worthy stop in Buffalo and one with which I was very impressed today. I went with my spouse and 20+ child and we all enjoyed",
          "The enclosures are very small, cramped. Left feeling sorry for the animals, doing this to wild animals is just wrong.",
          "One of my best friends and I decided to end our workout day after playing tennis at Delaware park and power walking, let's go to the zoo. What a nice treat, we felt memories of childhood come flooding back. More and more animals to see, no lions or tigers but polar bears.",
          "I grew up going to the Bronx Zoo (a very large metropolitan zoo) as a child, so perhaps I was expecting a bit more from a zoo in a major city. Not much to see here...and rather small enclosures housing some rather large, seemingly unhappy creatures. The only time the zoo",
          "Small urban zoo with small exhibit spaces for the animals. It would do better if they scaled back on exhibits/animals and gave them more space. Entrance has a Wallyworld quality that does not fit with the historic neighborhood and adjacent Olmsted park.",
          "Buffalo Zoo is a great place to spend an hour or a day! Plenty of shade, and eating areas available. Always clean and well kept. My grandchildren love the hours spent there. We pack our own lunch and snacks as you can always find a place to sit and rest. Be sure to wear comfy",
          "It's a good size zoo. It has your favorite animals and great exhibits. My kids loved it. The price was reasonable. It's an affordable day trip especially if you bring your own food and drinks.",
          "The zoo is smaller than most which makes it a great trip for children. Things are closer together and you don't have to walk for miles. The new polar bear exhibit is beautiful but the past 2 trips I have yet to see them out. The gorilla exhibit was my favorite. There was a",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a wonderful experience for families. With the new polar bear exhibit little ones can watch the bears swim right up to the glass. We purchased a grandparents' pass so we can return throughout the summer.",

          "The Buffalo Zoo is a relatively old zoo, that has made an effort to improve the lot of at least some animals..... That said, most of the animals were not able to be viewed, and those that were out, did not seem comfortable....many waiting at their respective doors to go",
          "Too expensive. Nothing much inside. Only some common animals. I just liked the Royal bengal tiger. Not satisfied. Too expensive",
          "A truly urban zoo, right in the middle of a city park. It is not large but what exhibits they have are great. The architecture alone is worth the trip. Check out the facade of the Elephant House (I bought a painting by one of the elephants). When we were there we got to see",
          "I have lived in Buffalo all my life and I still visit the zoo every couple years with my grandchildren. There have been many recent improvements and many positives. My only complaint is the limited number of animals. I realize one of the issues with this zoo is limited space,",
          "I haven't been to the zoo in many years and was impressed. Exhibits were clean and well done and zoo was easily manageable. There were groups of small children who were well behaved and I was glad to see small rides and lots for them to do... Nice picnic areas... Rain forest was",
          "We hit the zoo before we headed home from seeing the falls! We were there first thing in the morning and stayed about an hour and a half. Very nice zoo that both my teenagers loved! Only disappointment was that the polar bears were no where to be found!",
          "It is a great place to take your children and yourselves, it's clean food is great, very safe. Animals are well taken care of. Beautiful place, I would love to go back.",

          "We stopped in to see the new lion cub recently born. We were able to see the cub and his parents on display. The zoo was clean and well kept. The staff were all very friendly. This is a small zoo where you can see most of the animals in an hour or two. The rainforest and polar",
          "We hadn't been to the Buffalo Zoo since the kids were in strollers so nearly ten years later they opted to visit it on the 4th. We got there as it opened at 10 AM and parked in the far end of the lot under the trees which I would suggest on a warm summer day. It was not very",

          "The zoo has gone through many changes in the last few years, but there still is some work to be done. Considering the rates that they charge, you would expect a little better quality. You can tell the animals are well cared for and the staff does a wonderful job with them. It",
          "We visited the Zoo yesterday. The parking lot was packed, but the zoo wasn't congested at all. The animals had plenty of room to move around. Speaking of the animals, there were so many to look at. Staff was kind. Great time at the zoo.",

          "I remember the Buffalo Zoo being disappointing as a teenager, and now, 20-30 years later; still disappointing. I am glad to see there are certain areas of Buffalo that are finally being built up (inner harbor/canal side); however, the Buffalo Zoo needs a serious overhaul. Simply",
          "I normally would not be caught dead in a zoo but my daughters good friend had her birthday there so I let her make the decision to go. The rainforest exhibit stinks of poop, maybe they can circulate it with fresh the air??? Gross. The bats have no room to fly. Several animals",
          "We've been members of the zoo for years and have enjoyed watching it transform into what it is now. Many updates are still needed, but it has transformed nicely. Food is pretty much american/burger joint style so doesn't really serve vegan/vegetarian folks, so bring your own!",
          "My family went for a weekend visit to Buffalo and it was recommended that we stop at the Zoo. It was a nice visit. It was clean, had a wide variety of animals, a carousel and train ride, and some food options. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it was 90+ the day we",
          "I expected more. The staff seemed to be very friendly and the grounds were well kept. There were only a few animals out while visiting. Some of the enclosures seemed on the smaller side. It would be nice to see them have a little bit more room.",
          "It was a decent zoo other than elephants have NO room and you can't see them lots of things closed,wished they had more to do their and open seems like for the 3rd oldest zoo it could use some major work",
          "Our 4 year olds go to the zoo every year in May. This year with the new polar bear habitat and some other upgrades the trip was wonderful. The zoo has come a long way and can now compete with other nearby zoos.",
          "I went here in early April with a photography group. It was a rather cold and grey day so maybe that was why there were not a lot of other visitors around but it was certainly quiet and we were able to have good access to a lot of the exhibits and see a number of animals. The",
          "A lone elephant was in a cage she couldn't even turn around in. The keepers said she could get out, but the doors were closed and she was trapped. The poor sea lion swam in circles, probably looking for a way out. Most of the habitats were extremely sub-par with little or no",
          "I live in the city of Buffalo and my children grew up listening to lions roaring and elephants trumpeting from our backyard. We live several blocks from the Buffalo Zoo. We made friends with the baby gorillas and we loved watching Luna, up close and personal, being raised by",
          "This zoo is a nice zoo to visit. They have lots of animals. It's very easy walking. The animals are spaced nicely apart. They have a nice picnic area. The best part was all the baby animals. Great for all ages.",
          "Visited while on vacation with my family. Nice place for the family, nice animal attractions. Still working on new attractions for future visits. Check for half prices deals, will save some.money if going in groups.",
          "They currently have a cute baby lion. My favorite! It's easy to walk, It's like a vintage zoo, but hAS updates",
          "I was really expecting this zoo to be better than the Seneca zoo in Rochester. I was disappointed. It's a nice zoo but it's smaller and more expensive than I'm used to.",
          "Mid-size zoo, easily walkable w/in 2 hrs with varied animals. The new exhibit, Arctic Edge, is wonderful with polar bears and other arctic animals and with an in depth, interactive center on the polar bear and importance or energy conservation. Male baby gorilla born in Jan, 2",
          "My family and I used to frequent the Buffalo Zoo. We purchased the season pass and walked around regularly. Delaware park is also right next to the zoo making it a wonderful Saturday trip. The indoor rainforest exhibit is wonderful when it is cold outside. I was very surprised",
          "I visit zoos more than most people, probably. This is a pretty zoo, the elephant house is a treasure from the civilian conservation corps days. They h a very special breeding programs here, mudpuppies, different reptiles...a little rainforest exhibit which is fascinating, a",
          "I became a member to take my grandkids and find I go there often. The new bear exhibits put the animals right next to the glass. You are inches away. Wonderful that Buffalo has expanded the spaces for the animals..",
          "I live probably five minutes from the zoo and every time I go it is just as fun as the first time. The new polar bear exhibit is gorgeous and they are always so interactive and looking like they are having as great of a time as I am. I love watching animals play together, it",
          "We were quite pleased with this zoo. It's not huge but a decent size, with a good selection of animals including the main ones you expect - elephants, lions, zebras. The buildings are nice (some are over 100 years old), the grounds are well-kept. The staff were very friendly,",
          "Beautiful day in the City. We decided to go to Zoo. We are members, So there was no additional cost for us to attend. You may want to check their website for admission costs If one wants to save on Parking, there is off the street parking with a reasonable walk The zoo was",
          "We purchased a Groupon for $20 for a family of four and are so glad we did! The zoo is fun, with a lot of wonderful animals...especially the new baby gorilla that's only 3 months old! We love the indoor rainforest too. Overall we just loved the zoo, so much fun for all ages.",
          "My family and I (2 adults/3kids) visit the buffalo zoo often. We actually decided to get a yearly pass. There are many animal exhibits to see, plus the newly polar bear exhibit. My kids love it here, so much to see and do, you can spend the whole day here. You can even grab a",
          "We enjoyed the visits, though several displays were under renovation. Well presented indoor learning and knowledge centers.",
          "I have been coming to the zoo since I was a kid. I worked at the zoo as a teenager. Now, as an adult, I am a member. It is only gotten better over the years and it's about time! The Arctic exhibit is amazing, but I was sad to see the wolf exhibit is changing. Luna the polar",
          "This zoo is making improvements and they are great. Nicer animal and visitor friendly exhibits are now available. A message board with times of feedings/meet the keeper/etc. at certain spots in the zoo would be a nice addition.",
          "Wonderful exhibits. Very clean. Easy to get around. Staff helpful and animals seem well cared for. Loved the young giraffes",
          "The Buffalo Zoo had been bad for decades. They are trying to revitalize it, but until every exhibit is up to standard I think the animals should be removed and not returned until they have a proper environment to live in. I breaks my heart to see these beautiful animals in bad",
          "Great couple of hours with the family! Has a variety of animals. Never crowded. Feels like the old Zoos. Kinda like Central Park Zoo. Some enclosures I felt were abit small for some animals ... Very clean. Nice way to spend a family day or a date ;)",
          "The zoo was fun for a few hours of walking and picture taking, it was a cool March day with a threat of rain so it was fairly deserted on the day of our visit. The zoo is small but has very nice exhibits, the terrain was flat and very easy walking for us. We loved the indoor",
          "The Buffalo Zoo has an average selection of animals. It is well kept and charges a fair amount to enter. It's conveniently located just outside of Delaware Park where you can have a picnic and exercise.",
          "New arctic edge exhibit is great to get up close to some animals. Good value. Free parking during the winter months. Can get a little crowded in the summer. Animals, for the most part, seem genuinely happy compared to other zoos I've been to.",
          "We came across the border for a visit to the Buffalo Zoo for March Break. It was not crowded and almost all of the animals were out and active. The polar bears were very active and coming right up to the viewing glass. The gorillas were the same - very active and neat to watch.",
          "We went for a birthday party. Even though it was kinda cold out it was still a nice place to go. Can't wait til it gets warmer enjoy my membership.",
          "I went here as a little girl all the time and loved the place so much!!! Beautiful zoo and made such fun school trips. Today I feel like it just needs a makeover and to expand so that there's more too see and the animals have more room. I would be superrrrrr sad if I ever heard",
          "The zoo has been undergoing renovations for the past several years, and they are continuing to update various exhibits. It's a great place to spend the day with your family. Make sure to visit Luna at the new polar bear exhibit. She loves people and comes right up to the glass",
          "We've been to some larger zoos, but found the amount of walking required (more than a young child was able to handle over the course of a day) and the number of animals that chose to seclude themselves in areas where they couldn't be seen made them disappointing. Buffalo zoo is",
          "During the summer hours the food stands are great. You can even order a large pizza and feed the whole family. Every year they add new attractions and the cost is very affordable.",
          "With most of my zoo visits being to well-known zoos such as the ones in the Bronx and Columbus, the Buffalo Zoo was a bit of a shock. The design is quite old, with relatively-small enclosures that don't reflect natural habitats. Building interiors smelled quite a bit. I had",
          "We arrived during a snowstorm, very surprised to find the zoo opened, the cashier has been super kind and helpful. He suggestes us to play with the polar bear (super cute and clearly happy animal) and also to say hi to the Gorillas (very interesting). It is quite big, good space",
          "Located within walking distance of the Darwin Martin House in Buffalo, NY. The Zoo is working on a new Polar Bear Exhibit. Fun for the kids, and adults too!",
          "We are current members of the zoo and have visited several times. It is one of our favorite places to go year round. It is small (23 acres) compared to other zoos, but what our director, Dr. Donna Fernandes, has done with this small space is incredible. The Arctic Edge exhibit",
          "I have seen the Zoo in the 50's threw the eyes of a child were everything was new and fun . each year another improvement another exhibit .Spring, summer,fall but in winter you have less to see,, then you move inside with the wildlife were it's warm and dry.Parking lot not",
          "Visited the zoo this past July 2015. I have fond memories of the semi circle bear pits, which were non existant. Monkeys and reptiles. I remember when the first giraffes came to the zoo. My favorite was always the elephants, Not this time! More concerning was the closed",
          "For an older urban zoo Buffalo makes the use use of it's space. Now in winter mode the carousel is gone, and it's hard to dig in the dino pits, but the rest of the zoo shies. The new Arctic Exhibit gave me another reason to stop by the zoo. Adding the wolfs, providing a larger",
          "The Buffalo Zoo continues to make great strides in improvements and new exhibits. Nice variety of animals in naturalistic settings.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is an excellent way to spend an afternoon. The exhibits are intelligently laid out, allowing large numbers of people to visit without feeling crowded. A good mix of animals are on display, including the silverback gorilla, polar bear, zebra, lion, and giraffe.",
          "I went to the Buffalo Zoo because I hadn't been there since I was young. Some of the animals were a delight to see, but I had concerns about a few of them. The snow leopard exhibited stereotypical pacing at the front of its enclosure, a sign that either its area was too small,",
          "Buffalo Zoo is small but that's the greatest part about it. This is a place where guests can really feel close to the animals. There is a wonderful variety of animals and a nice mix of indoor and outdoor. Seeing the lions grooming a foot away from you through glass is amazing! I",
          "I have been to many zoos around the world and the Buffalo Zoo is a very charming one. It's rather small but this does not take away from it. Visited on a very hot day mid summer so all the indoor education and viewing buildings which were air conditioned were great. When there",
          "Fabulous! This is a great zoo for both children and adults. Lots to see and many recent improvements.",
          "We have been to the Buffalo Zoo many times. I love that you can get a season pass that will pay for it self just after a few visits. My daughter always enjoyed it when we went over. Would reccomend it.",
          "Pros: Easy to navigate Smallish but had the usual suspects (elephant giraffe zebra bisons gorilla) Indoor areas - gorilla, reptiles- allowed reprieve from the sun on hot days Carousel and train ride also helps entertain small kids Good price and always seems to have coupons",
          "My 1 and a half year old granddaughter loved seeing the giraffe, zebra and monkeys. That's what she talked about.",
          "The Buffalo Zoo has a much improved look and feel compared to about 3 to 5 years ago. The new entrance located right at the parking lot makes it more accessible and convenient than where the entrance used to be in relation to the parking lot. The parking is still paid by a token",
          "Went to the Buffalo Zoo with a few friends and their grandchildren 4 boys ages 6-10. The boys spent the entire day running from exhibit to exhibit with a look of total surprise on their face. The sea lion exhibit kept them occupied for 45 minutes because they could go up and",
          "We took our two twin grandkids to the buffalo zoo a few days ago. In short they loved it. The polar bear was a favorite. The giraffes are always inspiring as the two kids a boy and girl looked wide eyed upon their size. They loved the outdoor savanna and of course the reptile",
          "I heard that this zoo was bad and small and wasn't worth a trip, but I was in the area and I figured I would give it a look. Now I've been to many zoo's, including the Bronx Zoo, and let me tell you, I still really enjoyed the Buffalo zoo. Though there aren't many \"OMG LOOK AT",
          "I have been to this zoo many times and each time it seems to be upgraded and improved. The exhibits are newer provide good views, the restrooms are clean and newer. There is a decent restaurant with plenty of outdoor seating. There are some nice side events for kids.",
          "It's good place for young kids. The size is small but my kids used to love The Buffalo Zoo. But it doesn't have a variety of animals you can watch.",
          "Buffalo Zoo is what I call a no frills zoo. There are no \"celebrity animals\" like rare pandas (Toronto Zoo) or albino tigers. The zoo is compact and easy to get around if you are traveling with children or the elderly. The animals appear healthy and well fed. The staff are",
          "This is a nice small zoo. There are many different kinds of animals. The entire facility is well kept and is easy to get around. Go and spend a few hours enjoying the animals from around the world. The new Artic Edge area is fun and educational.",
          "What a beautiful Zoo. Easy to walk around, big enough to hold lots of animals and spend a full day. Brand new exhibits. Fun events all year round. Great for the whole family.",
          "A wonderful place for the whole family. Lots to see and experience and learn about life around the world.",
          "It had been 12 years since we've visited the zoo, Big changes! New habitats. New surroundings. Perfect view of the animals. Clean! Clean Clean! Animals well cared for and in new surroundings. Information easy to read, short and concise. Explanation of why these creatures are",
          "Lots of great exhibits and animals. The arctic exhibit is coming soon. Plenty of parking and enough to see for at least half a day if not more.",
          "Nice place to spend the day , got to meet the Baby Giraffee , The rainforest area was absolutely outstanding",
          "The zoo was not overly large. It was easy to get to with a great parking area. The cost reflected the size of the zoo. There were many different animals and each area was clearly marked on the guide / map leaflet. As it was September there were not many drink or food stands open",
          "My wife liked it but I wasn't very impressed. I have been away from Buffalo for about 25 years now and maybe its just me but I remember a much more grand experience. My wife's only dissapointment was not seeing the buffalo there, they were not outside or inside the zoo nowhere",
          "New presentation of polar bears and some other surrounding exhibits is awesome! You walk right next to a polar bear behind glass. We had a fun time it is a nice sized zoo, was impressed at how many animals were out. I think because the number of people visiting is few. Priced",
          "My preschoolers loved this zoo. Although it was a bit sparse on animals and I was surprised to see animals kept in large containers/rooms in doors, I reminded myself of the history of the zoo and got over it. We're visiting again soon, a great place spend a few hours. The",
          "This Zoo is a fun time and fairly priced, Plenty of parking and so much to do. Easy driving to the zoo its centrally located just on the city outskirt.",
          "Nice medium sized zoo. Never to packed so the animals are typically out and about and not being shy. Great place for the family if you want to kill a few hours!",
          "Love going to the zoo to see all the animals, especially the babies... Had a private tour and learned the oldest living thing in the zoo is a huge 100+ yr old tree. It's under construction in some areas, can't wait to see the new elephant enclosure.",
          "This was our first visit to the Buffalo Zoo. The admission process was a little confusing as there are ticket windows that go along the front of the building and around the corner . . . the flow of the exhibits is a little weird, kind of weaves in and out with no clear exits on",
          "Plenty of parking on grounds, but have to purchase token to exit parking lot. Thought it was quite expensive admission considering the exhibits. We did not see any polar bears, or any bears for that matter! Had to view elephants through thick glass windows of the door to their",
          "This is a great small zoo. There's a good variety of animals and a nice mix of indoor and outdoor exhibits. Be sure to try out the Rainforest Falls exhibit. It's a nicely recreated rainforest environment where birds and animals completely surround you. The key to this zoo is",
          "Took my kids here today. The construction is a big pain to me. Things are coming along but still a hassle. Exit signs were not rerouted as they should have been. With that said everyone did have a good time. I have always liked our zoo. I just can't wait for zoo construction to",
          "Its a medium size zoo. it require half day, about 2-3 hrs. we parked in a free parking near the rear fence. There was a beautiful free playground area for kids. some animals like the lion and the tiger were sleepy. there was a construction going.",
          "Had a great time with my nephews! Lots of animals and activities with animals as well. Loved the bird exhibit, beautiful!",
          "The price is right ($10 per person) but there was something depressing about this zoo. A lot of the animals seemed depressed or lonely. A lot of the vendor stands/kids activities were closed or vacant. Other than the rhinos, the animals didn't appear to have adequate space to",
          "Much of the zoo is being remodeled so many exhibits were closed. The seal exhibit was nice. Offered reciprocity to Zoological Society members.",
          "We enjoyed our visit in August 2015, but the zoo could use a little more interaction with the zookeepers - and open space for the animals. Maybe we just missed everything, but I've been to other zoos where they had a lot more \"demonstrations\" if you want to call it that. The",
          "We took the grandkids to see the baby polar bears they love it .they want to go all the time.every weekend",
          "As a kid, you loved going to the zoo to see all the \"wild\" animals. Well the Buffalo Zoo makes that experience come alive again for adults as well as children. Well laid out with very informative exhibits, it is a great way to enjoy a day. Come early, parking right outside",
          "Was there recently, had a great time at a wine/beer/cider/food tasting event, very cool, great zoo, seems that they have gone to great lengths to make the place something special and it has worked, ok it's not the NYC Zoo but it is Buffalo, compact but very enjoyable, great",
          "No animals should ever have to go through the trauma the animals do at Buffalo Zoo. I went to the zoo today with 3 good friends 2 of which study animal conservation and at first we were excited the staff were so lovely, but the moment we walked inside we burst into tears we saw",
          "We went to the Buffalo Zoo when we had a 3hr break between a Bat Mitzvah and the reception. The zoo accepted our reciprocal membership, gave us a map, and we were able to see all but 1 animal and ride one ride in 2hrs. There were some animals there u had b vet seen before and",
          "Grand Parents took Parents & 3 under 6 for the afternoon, we were done in say 2.5 hrs. It was Lovely, well kept, clean, changes always ongoing. Not a LONG walk.. manageable with little ones.. Lots to see, nice variety. Hands on buildings, aquariums, inside exhibits.. play areas,",
          "The zoo is very good for the size of the city of Buffalo. It's easy to get around and the parking is close with easy access. Definitely worth a visit next time you're in Buffalo.",
          "The Zoo was laid out very well it was easy to follow the map. For a small Zoo they had quite a variety of animals.",
          "Zoo a is great place for young children to learn especially at the Buffalo Zoo. Fun Fun and education.",
          "It is not bad for the price. They have variey of animals. I love the indoor exhibit. You can park on one of the side streets to save some money.",
          "This is our first year with a zoo membership and if you go a couple of times it is paid off. Definitely worth it. The zoo is small and some exhibits are run down. But with that said they are really trying to build it up and fix things little by little with fundraising efforts.",
          "$10.50 admission fee for adults. This place is a disaster. I have been to many zoos throughout this and other countries and this rates as one of the worst. Where is all the money going that is being raised to renovate this zoo? The park, in general, is run down. The grounds",
          "I went with my 1 1/2 year old and it was perfect. It's a small zoo but it has a wide variety of animals. We saw everything in about 2 hours. It has nice displays and was very clean.",
          "Pathetic to say about the animals living there in Zooquarium. All I know about zoo, a place to see animals in large enclosure where they roam free and taken care of.I literally cried the way I saw the only elephant in there, how they were kept in, may be 40 * 20 feet enclosure",
          "We really enjoyed the zoo. For a small zoo, they had a lot of animals., My grandkids especially loved the giraffes.",
          "Good place for my son to see animals. He had fun. Go there early or else not enough parking spaces. There was still construction going on for some of the sites like the elephant exhibit and they will have a preschool exhibit in the near future.",
          "I used to have a membership because I thought it was a great to take the kids and spend quality time with the family. The zoo is nice with a variety of species and habitats but it is too small. The quality and quantity of the different species and habitats are limited by its",
          "Still an entertaining place to visit and see some animals. The staff is trying to improve the attractions and have been successful since our last \"date\" with the kids 20 yrs ago. No, not a big zoo, good enough for Buffalo.",
          "The Buffalo zoo is a lovely family outing. It is comprised of many older buildings which have been well kept . The zoo itself is well set-up and has lots of shady areas to stop for a rest( necessary with little ones ) There are many interesting displays to view and the animals",
          "We visited today with our two kids, 4 and 8. We went last year too. This is not a huge zoo with lots of animals and walking, but that was good for us. I think it was a good value. It took us about 3 hours to see all the exhibits and then the kids played in the playground and",
          "Took my granddaughter to the Buffalo Zoo for the first time (14 months) and she loved seeing the animals especially the ocelot, ant eater, colorful birds and the fish. Munched on the chicken nuggets we ordered at the on site food arena. Grounds and animals are being well",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is small, but a great value. I love the simple layout. You don't really have to do a lot of doubling back to see everything. A lot of the exhibits have a variety of vantage points and glass windows. The rainforest walkthrough is awesome, and has two levels so",
          "We took my daughter here for her 1st birthday. She really didn't know what was going on, but she loved the animals. I was saddened to see that in each exhibit there was only one animal - one lion, one gorilla, one rhino. It was quite sad. The zoo itself is okay at best. The",
          "I should have come on here and read reviews before making the trip to the Buffalo Zoo. I will totally admit it was our own fault for not knowing but we thought we would be seeing the newly renovated zoo. Last time we were at the Zoo we were told it would be completed in Spring",
          "I recently had the pleasure of a return trip to the Buffalo Zoo. This zoo is set up very nicely. The only problem we had when we were there was the construction going on. They are building a new Arctic Experience area. I will have to return when it is finished, looks like it",
          "I was very disappointed with a 2hr drive to this zoo. The grounds were not well kept where the animals are, a lot of the animals you can see as the overgrowth is a place for them to hide. The elephant was in a large building behind bars and not in the normal area where it can",
          "The zoo was pretty neat overall, but there was a lot of construction, which gave the feeling of a good portion of the zoo being off limits.",
          "We were only in Buffalo for the day and it rained all day. We had promised our kids a stop at the zoo, so we went in the rain. We had the place to ourselves. Of all the zoos we have been to, we have never seen a hyena--and this time we did! Was able to get great pictures, as",
          "Not impressed with the small habitats and felt bad for the animals. The animals were also not always in pairs. One tiger? One hyena? Three giraffes in a small mowed lawn? A giraffe kept indoors in a boxing ring-sized cage? If you want to put wild animals on display, at least",
          "I am amazed by the changes that the Buffalo Zoo have made. It has gotten so much bigger than when I was a kid. I remember it being big when I was a younger so I promised my daughter when we go to Buffalo I would take her to theBuffalo zoo, and boy was I surprised at much bigger",
          "It's horrible. If you can't do it right you shouldn't do it at all. Close this zoo. This is animal abuse. Picture 2 Bald Eagles in a cage that they can't fly. Giraffes back yard so small they can't even get a running start. No stimulation for any animals. Apes and Lions have no",
          "Had heard great things about the Buffalo Zoo so wanted to come check it out. Small zoo, easy to move around in and see everything. Very clean. The zoo is currently under much construction and many exhibits were closed. Not sure why they would choose to do construction like this",
          "The zoo is not large but has a good variety of animals given it's size. some animals are \"single\" but not sure if thier partners were elsewhere, it is a good day out for all ages.",
          "Always pleasant for the children. Staff is readily available for information. Seems to be lacking in some areas bit other parts are just magnificent, especially the rain forest. The kids are always thrilled.",
          "Had a great day even thought it rained. .there was lots to see. ..baby gorilla was awesome and love the rain forest...",
          "Took a group of PK children for their first time to the zoo. What fun! It was easy to get around,very well organized,good restroom facilities,and great picnic area. It was a perfect day for all.",
          "The zoo is not huge but really has a good variety of animals given the size. It seemed sad that the animals sometimes didn't have partners but the zoo is accredited so it must be ok.",
          "Saw alot of animals up close. The habitats are kinda small so you can see the animals really well. Great for people but probably might suck for the animals. Nice way to spend a morning.",
          "This was a delightful zoo which was very clean and fun. We almost missed several exhibits due to the construction of the new areas that they are adding on, which will be exciting. There is a carousel face painting, a train ride. Great fun for the kids and adults alike.",
          "One of the oldest zoos in America and one of the last traditional cage and pen enclosures, we had a great time wondering around this facility. The place itself is pretty small in overall size so you have plenty of time to spend at each exhibit with no fear of not seeing all that",

          "Took my husband and little brother to the Buffalo zoo- we are about an hour and 15 mins away. Had lunch- not the healthiest of choices. They have all fast food- pizza, chicken fingers, chicken nuggets, pretzels, popcorn ect. They have great soft serve ice cream. There are a lots",
          "After visiting the zoo, we felt it really catered more towards really young children and not to teens/adults. It's a much smaller zoo than we are used to and ended up feeling a bit sad for the animals and the environments they're forced to live in. The zoos we usually visit have",
          "Donna Fernandes, President of The Buffalo Zoo, has done an amazing job transforming the zoo into an \"animal friendly space\". From the sea otters to the Rainforest to the summer Zoo Camps for aspiring zookeepers, the park has been completely transformed from what it was 20 years",
          "We love visiting Zoos But this one was not worth the money. Very Small, not much animals. The Rainforest was the nicest part of the zoo",
          "my kids are 5 and 7 and really enjoy the Buffalo zoo. It's the perfect size for them to be able to walk around and not get tired out. They especially love the Rainforest exhibit and the Barnyard.",
          "The buffalo zoo is alot to be desired as compared to other zoos in different states. I feel the animal houses are in need of great repair. Buffalo needs to dump some bucks into this zoo.",
          "The poor animals all look sickly and very sad. They should try and switch the animals out if possible or work on that. The front looks better, the ticket area",
          "This is a small zoo that is in the middle of the city. There is a $10 entry fee which is minimal to say the least. I am from Toronto, Canada and we have a large zoo but I enjoyed this small zoo more than out zoo. It is a great place to spend an hour or two. Kids will enjoy it,",
          "Truly a waste of money. I saw more animals at the bars downtown during Happy Hour. One or two Animals per site. Many areas were either closed or had no animals .The buffalo that ran away had the right idea. Stay away. Go to the waterfront instead",
          "An amazing zoo located within the city. Renovations are underway new Arctic Area for the polar bears and the like. The Tropical area is spectacular with all of the colors and sounds. Lots of baby animals have been born this and those are the ones that the grandkids love. Great",
          "We have been getting a Buffalo Zoo membership for the past 3 years now. It's a great place to take our young boys for a few hours. The zoo is small, usually takes about an hour to walk the whole thing. The food and souvenirs are affordable and the little playground they have set",
          "I absolutely love the Buffalo Zoo! It's such a fun place to visit. My family has had a membership since I was little. I've seen so many great improvements, especially over the last five years. The new-ish Rainforest Exhibit is beautifully done. The plants, trees, waterfall",
          "We went to the Buffalo Zoo during a March break day trip to Niagara.From the highway it looks a bit like a zoo/petting farm, and I've always wanted to go there but never had the time to stop. It was a little pricey but not terrible, and we were able to use a coupon we'd",
          "The zoo was very nice and not overpriced. It is big enough that you can easily spend 3+ hours there. The enclosures are very nice and it seems as if the animals are well taken care of. If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend a visit here.",
          "Figured this would be a small zoo, quickly realized it was winter! Most of the animals were not at the zoo in March, however we did stay for almost an hour on the giraffe building as there were two babies! Adorable! During summer months this may be a good zoo for families with",
          "The Buffalo Zoo is a great place to visit because it is small enough so that it isn't overwhelming. The animals are so well taken care of and loved by the staff. I was a volunteer there for ten years and was so impressed by the passion these people show. There are also",
          "What a nice day! Two adorable baby giraffes, baby Indian rhino, a young playful gorilla, even baby rattlesnakes. This is a great zoo to take young children, they can see the animals easily. I am sure when the Arctic exhibits opens later this year I will be giving the zoo a five",
          "Although it's a relatively small to medium zoo (you can walk through it easily in a single day), it has been greatly improved in recent years and is very enjoyable for a day out. The city zoo boasts a small \"farm\" exhibit; a brand new \"rain-forest\" building; and a carousel,",

          "This zoo has changed SO much throughout the years. I *love* their new entrance. They have so many hands on activities for the children to get them excited about animals and learn at the same time. Personally, that is quite an improvement from the typical exhibit with a small",
          "My two grandkids (ages 4 and 3) enjoyed the zoo and were thrilled to ride the small animals and rides. Glad to see they are improving the exhibits (some are very old).",
          "Over the years I have visited many zoos. I would rate Buffalo's as mediocre due to the lack of interactive, hands-on opportunities for little ones. I am accustomed to explorable areas sprinkled throughout a zoo (animals and giant spiderwebs to climb on for instance) and only",
          "*The exhibits only held one animal with no toys or real environment making them seem very \"sad\" and lonely . *A lot of animals were not in their exhibit and or were just plain empty. Which I am sure has to do with funding but there has to be a way to help with that? *The park",
          "After recent visits to the Columbus and Toronto zoos, there is no question that Buffalo Zoo stands above them. The animal habitats are spacious and kept clean, the animals appear to be in good health and relaxed, not agitated or in a state of withdrawn fear. Unlike other zoos,",
          "Never disappointed. It's great to see all the changes they keep making over the last few years. Much better and seemingly more animal-friendly attractions. Even on a cold or rainy day, the indoor exhibits (particularly Rainforest Falls). The kids always enjoy Sea Lion Cove",
          "Just big enough to spend a few hours with your kids. We are members of the zoo and take the grandkids a few times a year. They have a nice area made into a dinosaur dig. It has shade and provides a good rest area after walking a lot. The zoo is constantly improving and has just",

          "This is a great zoo. It's not so huge that you have to dedicate an entire day to it - you can do it in a few hours. The exhibits are great and I can't wait until the polar bear exhibit is complete. The tropical rain forest/birdhouse exhibit is fantastic especially going up to",

          "Great zoo with wonderful attractions. Love that they have been adding new things and have small rides for children of small ages. We would take our children there when they were younger - a membership is the way to go if you are going to go a couple times and with children who",
          "This zoo is just the right size for my grandkids and me. Always being improved. While I sometimes feel sad for the animals in a zoo, I know that everything us being done to give them a good life without the dangers that they would face in their natural habitats. Yu can see that",

          "Anyone visiting Buffalo with children should plan on spending a day at the Buffalo Zoo. It is large enough to host a variety of animals, but unlike some zoos, it is small enough to be able to see everything in one day. The beautiful Rainforest Exhibit is a year round treat.",

          "Stop in with the kids and you will enjoy yourself. The best feature of the zoo is how close you can get to the animals. Unlike many larger zoos where the animals are so far away often you can't see then, here they are really close. Much of the zoo has undergone recent",
          "I've taken my children many times to this zoo. It might not be the best but it has much to offer and is a lot of fun particular way to take the grandkids. We have made significant improvements over the year. It's surrounded by Delaware Park and also close to the art museum.",

          "We enjoy going to zoos in the different cities we visit and are never disappointed. This zoo is undergoing a lot of construction right now, so there are some inconveniences, but it will be well worth it for the animals and visitors when they are done. We especially enjoyed",
          "What zoo isn't though!! Can spend an entire day here and still not see everything they have to offer!! Highly recommended and I suggest getting there early for parking. Now with the parking being closer to the main entrance it is worth the money!!",

          "The first thing I noticed was the construction at this zoo...however, I never deem that a bad thing as it means they are expanding and making the zoo more enjoyable for future visits. Many of the animals were out and enjoying the nice day. There are lots of exhibits and plenty",

          "We went here with our grandkids while visiting Buffalo and they have a great annual family pass which our son and his wife had taken advantage of. The polar bear enclosure was great and so was the bird/waterfall exhibit. Stunning! There are great wide open spaces for the kids",
          "I went to the zoo for the first time in 15 years and I was absolutely traumatized. Not what I expected from Zoo! All the animal enclosures were way too small! There was a Buffalo being swarmed by 80 bees. The elephant inside was in a cage barely larger then himself. Imagine",

          "This once great zoo has been showing signs of neglect over the past few years. The exhibits have shrunk - less and less animals - and the overall look has declined. The price has gone up too - but this seems unjustified. Not a bad zoo, but considering that it is twice the size",
          "We went on dollar day so it was busy but fun. Everyone was so friendly but talked negatively about the grounds around us. Rainforest was nice and our favorite sight."

Be prepared to be amazed. Help preserve this place by not touching the inside or outside of the house other than the handrails.",
          "Interesting indoor tour! Love the architecture.",
          "Absolutely loved what they did to the house. Our guide was amazing and very patient with my 3 year old. We bought quite a few items from the gift store - they are just so artsy and nice! We became a member on this first visit.",

          "My husband and I did the 2 hour tour while in town for the weekend.  The docent, Dave, was fantastic with indepth knowledge.  Definitely do the 2 hour tour if you have time, having a chance to see the Barton house, the Gardener's Cottage and the additional rooms of the main house were worth it.",
          "This was a gorgeous house to visit.  They have guided tour, which I highly recommend.  The tour guides are very knowledgeable about the architecture and the history of the house, which was all fascinating.  They don't let you take photos inside the house, which is too bad.  But other than that, it was a great place to visit.",

          "Had the hour tour, of that hour; half of it is spent outside of the house.  First you watch a video.  Second you spend time outside of the house as tour guide talks about the house.  For what you pay for the tour I would prefer being in the house not outside the house.",

Come next summer when the plantings will be in and lovely. A must see!",

          "The tour was great! The house is really amazing and the guide did a good job of explaining all of the architectural aspects as well as giving an entertaining background on the people. As someone with not a lot of previous knowledge in architecture I was still able to understand and enjoy. I took the two hour tour.",

          "Anyone who lives in or comes to visit Buffalo, NY who has an interest in art and / or architecture as well as landscaping ... and even the history of the city should not miss touring this unique, beautiful, and interesting complex of homes. My friend and I signed up for the two",

          "I personally do not like the design of this place and it is not a wow. Many people think it is so I'll give it a mediocre rating overall, although my personal opinion is two stars. I have seen a lot better historic homes than this, but this is the best Buffalo has to offer.",
          "We are casual fans of Frank Lloyd Wright and now I am even more so. The tour guides arecvolunteers but you wouldn't know it unless they told you. The compound is meticulously taken care of. The gift shop is great too. They have a cafe now but we didn't have time for a visit.",
          "We've seen a number of Frank Lloyd Wright properties, this is the best restored of any of them. The one hour guided tour was perfect!",
          "We took the 1 hour tour with Docent Barbara. The tour was informative and the complex beautifully kept. I highly recommend this tour!",
          "Actually, Buffalo has two impressive architectural treasures in one small area, where Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Prairie-style Darwin Martin House complex sits on a corner lot in Frederick Law Olmstead\u2019s tree-lined Parkside neighborhood.

          "My husband, sister and I enjoyed our 2-hour tour of the Darwin Martin house complex very much. Our guide, Brian Smith brought to life the relationship between FLW and his patron, Darwin Martin, and clearly explained the quirky design details so characteristic of Wright's work.",
          "We very much enjoyed our 2 hour tour. They have done a wonderful job of preservation and restoration. Even with 2 hours it felt like we barely scratched the surface, there is just so much ground and history to cover!",
          "never saw the magic in a FLW house. those tiny windows and rigid lines make for a dark and soul-less existence. Over rated without any sense of joy of living, comfort , passion, and especially LIGHT. I'll take Le Corbusier'.",
          "The Martin House must rate among the best, and best-restored, of Frank Lloyd Wright houses. Our marvelous docent took our party on a brilliant two-hour tour, highlighting and thoroughly explaining the provenance and features of this magnificent site. I would highly recommend",
          "We had the pleasure to take the full tour which lasted 2 hours. When booking, it seemed like a long time to spend on a house tour, but the time flew by. We were amazed at the renovations and the skilled craftsmen who painstakingly restored and replicated many of the features and",
          "Wonderful tour with tons of local and national implications. Best tour we took in Buffalo. This renovation of 3 homes on the campus is so well done. The attention to detail perfection. FLW was a genius ahead of his time. His homes look spectacularly constructed for each",
          "For anyone who has any interest in architecture, a visit to the Darwin Martin House is a must! We visited this home a number of years ago and loved it then. But with the many renovations that have been made, the home has surely become a showpiece for the genius of Frank Lloyd",
          "We have visited 8 FLW houses. This is the only one that charges differently to see half or the whole house. We took the one hour tour $22 minutes not to find out we would have had to pay more to see the rest of the house. What a rip off.",
          "We took the one hour tour which disappointingly didn\u2019t include bedrooms or Barton house, but it was so cozy inside that we didn\u2019t mind...really a nice feeling and a highlight of Buffalo visit...especially after seeing the vandalism done to the poor Albright-Knox Gallery and the",
          "Two FLW houses in one day! I was at Graycliff in the morning, now I'm at Martin House in the afternoon. It was a different design style than Graycliff, but still an amazing design. Sad that the back half is a complete reproduction of the original structure. Interesting history",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our one hour tour. The house is incredible and the renovated grounds were gorgeous as well. The staff were all super friendly. A very pleasant experience. We would have done the two hour tour since it took you upstairs and into the other buildings...maybe next",

          "On the 2 hour tour, you see 7 buildings and boy are they worth it. Wright built examples for the lower, mid and high end market and you can see how his approach varies. Our guide, Dave, was great. He really knew his stuff! We saw Wright's finger print on each living space,",
          "The Martin House and grounds have been beautifully restored. This is a must visit for fans of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. We took the all day tour which included the Martin House, a filling station at the Pierce-Arrow Museum, a boat house, Graycliff, and a mausoleum. Kudos",
          "The work put into restoring this prairie house is amazing. The 1-hour tour we took was well done and the facilities are surprisingly good for what I thought would be a small house tour. You can see the house inside up close and wander the grounds. The only drawback is that most",

          "The renovations have just been completed, so my review reflects seeing the newly refurbished parts of the house that were previously closed. The visitor center is where the tour starts with a video/history/back story of D.D. Martin, and it's good information to have, as it",

          "This house is a spectacular trip into Frank Lloyd Wright's designer's mind. Amazed to learn how destroyed the house was before it's rescue. Impressed by the tales of it's restoration. Well worth the time spent!",
          "This was a return visit for me to see the restorations that have been accomplished since my last visit and OMG, there is an entire visitors center now which is fantastic and where the tour starts. We did the 2 hour tour because-- it's the Martin House! This is one of my favorite",

          "We were thinking at the end of our 2 hour tour that we wouldn't have had time to see all the buildings and would have been rushed to complete a tour in just an hour. The house is fascinating and our docent Dave pointed out all the different features which we would've missed",
          "Amazing restoration of one of the great architects designs. Amazing detail of woodworking and glass throughout. Someone only gave it 3 stars because they wouldn't live there. That's not the point. It's a beautiful home to tour, well worth your time.",

          "It\u2019s great having a fully restored Frank Lloyd Wright house in Buffalo. The Buffalo area really has two FLW houses and one commercial building, the Larkin Building. FLW was way ahead of his time. Right now the landscaping is being totally redone. Great experience.",

          "Do yourself a massive favour and opt for the two-hour tour extended tour - it is well worth the extra hour of time and 15USD - based on my experience on the day, you will get both a lot more time to spend in the house and listen to the knowledgeable and absolutely charming tour",
          "We visited this house with reservations made well in advance. Frank Lloyd Wright structures are not unknown to my wife and me. This house tour was thorough and very interesting. To fin it in Buffalo, NY was a surprise. We were not disappointed and would suggest that a visit",

          "Tours offered on the hour, either a one-hour tour of the main house or a two-hour tour that includes the Gardener's cottage, a house built for Darwin Martin's sister and the upstairs of the main house. If you have time I'd definitely recommend the two-hour tour. There is so much",
          "Excellent tour. Well worth the $35 for two hours. Barry, our guide, was great! Easy to get to by Uber and was one of Frank Lloyd a Wright\u2019s most interesting homes (I\u2019ve been to two others)",
          "I've always been a fan of Frank Lloyd's and the Martin house was on my to-visit list from the moment I decided to visit Buffalo. I took the 1 hour tour and left wanting to come back and do a longer tour immediately! I was sad I didn't have more time. The staff was wonderful and",
          "This is a really unique experience for anyone who enjoys modern art and housing design. The artist's use of cut glass that changes colors based on the season and angle of the sun is not only brilliant but truly imaginative. The House is just full of these kinds of innovative",

          "It was raining and there was renovation going on at the time. We were impressed and would like to go back.",
          "Breathtaking architecture, a very knowledgeable guide, and fascinating history. Looking forward to returning when the garden restoration is complete.",
          "This was our first trip to a Frank Lloyd Wright home, and we're hooked! Can't wait to see more. We did the two-hour tour with a knowledgeable guide who clearly loves this house. The gardens were still under construction, so we have a good reason to return in the spring when it's",

          "Just a half hour drive from Niagara Falls, this restored home is well-worth a stop. We took the 2-hour tour (as opposed to the one hour tour). We were led through the Wright-designed gardener's house, the Martin House and conservatory, and the Barton house. Such phenomenal",
          "Also known as the Darwin Martin House National Historic Landmark, the Darwin D. Martin House Complex (Martin House) is a masterwork of Franklin Lloyd Wright (1867-1959). It was built for progressive businessman Darwin D. Martin (1865-1935) and his family between 1903 and 1905.",
          "We enjoyed visiting and viewing another Frank Lloyd Wright architectural design. The restoration is amazing. The tour was interesting and informative.",
          "I love FLW and have toured many of his homes. This was has been extensively remodeled with more work to do. I was disappointed that all of the landscaping was tore up and a fence was around the building. That made for a less beautiful view from the outside. Now I have to go back",
          "I have lived in Buffalo all my life and don't know why it took so long to go on this tour. My fried and I were the only 2 \"locals\" on the 2 hour tour. Others from Toronto, New Jersey, Maryland, ect...The restoration work is just fascinating, considering how long the main",
          "WOW to the whole experience! The introductory film was unique and well done. The museum next to the house was worth an explore too. This was the first Frank Lloyd Wright home I had ever been too. It's quite amazing just to drive up to it in a regular residential area. The house",
          "Great Frank Lloyd Wright mansion! I visited with a tour, but the staff never treated us like we were with a tour. This was a $50 million dollar restoration, and if you knew this great house before the restoration, then you'll understand how the money was WISELY spent. Well",
          "Should have informed us that we paid to listen to the guides for 50mins and saw the main floor for about 10mins ..there is no authenticity to the 1904 era ..a lot have been refurbished and rebuilt ...left feeling disappointed and would like a refund!",
          "The house and tour were very nice, however, we were there when they were redoing the gardens. Only dirt in the yard all around the houses. Too bad. Hope to get back there when the gardens are complete.",
          "We love our city of Buffalo with so many cool attractions and fun activities. We also boast one of the greatest architectural cities in the US. We are very lucky to have multiple Frank Lloyd Wright houses in our backyard. The Darwin Martin House was left for dead decades ago,",
          "Renovations made in the last few years have made quite a change. It is amazing. I would recommend this site to any visitor.",
          "This Frank Lloyd Wright property is currently undergoing a massive (and I do mean massive!) renovation project that is not scheduled for completion until sometime in 2019. Visitors would be well-advised just to avoid trying to go to see the place until they can do so without",

          "I am a fan of Wright, and being from Illinois originally, have seen some of his lovely homes there. This was even more impressive and interesting than what I've visited in Illinois. And the history of the Martin house made being able to see it restored even more special. We took",

          "I was amazed by the beauty and innovation of Wright's design. Our guide Dave was outstanding! Thanks for sharing so many intersting facts about the complex, the families who lived here and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. A definite must see when visiting Buffalo, NY.",
          "Barbara was our guide on the 2 hour tour. She was excellent and knowledgeable regarding the history and obscure facts.",

          "We had a very informative guide. Unfortunately, the headphones weren't working correctly so she had to shout over the landscaping work going on. Beautiful house, couldn't believe that part of it was allowed to be torn down, but they have done a great restoration. I should have",
          "Wow... Worth the visit.. and that's coming from a guy who isn't really into architecture.. ya I'm a midwest boy... ok now that's out of the way. The wife and I stumbled upon this while visiting Buffalo. What a gem! We looked on trip advisor and saw the reviews for the hour tour",
          "We visited for the 2nd time after a years lapse, nice to see what had been accomplished. Great tour and we will be back again! Nice to have a good time and learn something too.",
          "Back in the day, Mr. Martin did not give Wright a budget limit. This house is fairly large and you are provided with a comprehensive tour. Beautiful woodwork and interesting kitchen layout.",
          "An absolute must see when in Buffalo...not to be missed. Even though the landscaping was undergoing a major renovation, it didn't deter from an amazing tour of this Wright masterpiece. Pure genius; so far ahead of his time. A great tour allowing for access throughout the main",
          "There is much to see and do in Buffalo, but the Martin House is reason enough for a visit. It is spectacular. The story behind the house is as fascinating as the house itself. Whether your interest is primarily architecture or history, you will find everything about the",

          "You MUST visit Martin House if you are in Buffalo. Darwin Martin went from nothing, a 5th grade education, to the highest paid executive in the USA. He and Wright built an unbelievable home now being lovingly restored. Our guide was fantastic and the 2-hour we took was took",
          "We are huge fans of Frank Lloyd Wrights Homes...this one is very grand as we took the 1 hour tour....still under renovation, but soon will look magnificent. I would recommend the 2 hour tour as you get to see the upstairs too.",
          "As I live close by I have been to the complex a few times throughout the renovation. Now that it is mostly complete it is a true wonder of an era long gone. It is well worth taking the guided tour to get the stories behind the quirks an reasons for some of the design. If you",
          "I had Barry give our group the Darwin Martin Complex restoration tour. It was so fascinating with all the details he included in the tour. It's a bit longer than the normatl tour because you get to see areas that are not on the normal tour route. If you have a group, ask to",
          "Looked for things to do in Buffalo and this came up. Very much worth the visit. Wright\u2019s work is timeless and interesting. The lady leading the tour was very much up to all questions asked.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our two-hour of the Martine complex. Our guide Dave's enthusiasm for Wright's genius was infectious. We walked away with a clearer understanding of Wright's vision and and appreciation of the exquisite materials he used to realize that vision.",
          "A very impressive building and a nice tour guide who did a good job. it was nice but not very exciting. Also had to wait 1/2 hour for the kind of expensive tour to start.",
          "My husband obviously walks slowly, with difficulty, and uses a cane. Stairs must be taken slowly and carefully due to balance issues. All we needed was a slower walking pace, but that was not accommodated. Our guide even said, \"Hurry along, everyone; keep up!\" as he took off",
          "I visited August16th with a large group of FLW interpreters and staff from Wright's Home and studio in Oak Park IL on a pilgrimage to Buffalo sites and ultimately Fallingwater. Barry was our guide and he gave us an extensive restoration tour of the grounds and interiors. His",
          "I had heard of this house a while ago, but finally made the trip to Buffalo to see it. It was pretty interesting. Tickets can be purchased for the timed tours at the glass pavilion next door to the house. The house is quite the marvel to see considering it is well over 100",
          "We did a long weekend--Frank Lloyd Wright Pilgrimage starting with the Martin House. It was under construction because they are restoring the gardens, so we didn't get any photos of the outside. You aren't allowed to take photos inside for some reason and that was",
          "Very interesting and a good history tour. Enjoyed hearing about and viewing the property while it is undergoing refurbishment.",
          "We arrived to find out our tickets were inadvertently booked for the wrong day! The nice people at the desk rebooked us for later that day. Thank you Martin House team! We have seen several other FLW properties and this one is stunning. I liked it better than Fallingwater or",
          "The Darwin Martin House Complex is one of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s greatest accomplishments. The tour of this landmark home was led by a very capable docent and provided just the right amount of context and insight. We have visited several of Wright\u2019s homes before, and this was",
          "If you enjoy seeing unique architecture and design, check out the restored Martin house. The design is beautiful and unique. I was even impressed with the gardiner's house. My favorite part is the view along the covered corridor to the greenhouse, where you can see the statue",
          "This is the 4th Frank Lloyd Wright home that I have seen, including Falling Water. The others are all great too, but Darwin Martin is my favorite. It is absolutely stunning in every regard -- the work of an architect to whose genius I bow. The guide did a GREAT job of pointing",

          "This property has been painstakingly restored and the museum part of it provides a nice background to FLW and his works. Only takes an hour or so to visit, admission is reasonable, and parking is pretty easy. Can combine with a visit to the zoo as you are right in the area.",
          "Did first floor 1 hour tour. Good tour but think the could have made the tour much more interesting if they spoke more about FLW. They didn\u2019t go much into details of his history and his unique career",
          "I love FLW work so this was a must see for me. It is under restoration but well worth the tour. The house is huge and beautiful. I recommend the 2 hour tour so that you can see more of the property. We went into the gardeners house and the main house. It is absolutely",
          "This was FLW's first big residential project for a rich Buffalo businessman. Well worth a visit to understand his architectural style(s). You are first treated to an audio visual presentation prior to a guided tour of the house.",

          "It was absolutely amazing to see the home up close and personal. If you are a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright or architecture in general this is a can't miss.",
          "The tour of the Darwin Martin House was phenomenal! Our docent was very knowledgeable, interspersing facts with anecdotes in her presentation. The short movie at the start of the presentation was a great introduction to Frank Lloyd Wright. The whole experience was very enjoyable.",
          "A really wonderful house. And the restoration they are doing is remarkable. If you like architecture this is a can't miss place to see.",
          "Wonderful experience!!! To be in a building from this famous architect is enough to make the visit worthwhile. But seeing the exquisite restoration work is made the visit even better.",
          "We have visited most of the Wright properties- glad we saved this one for a later visit. What we learned on previous tours allowed us to appreciate this site. We had an outstanding guide who brought the property alive for us- definitely pleased we took the 2 hour tour . And",
          "A friend of mine who studies cultural history was in town from Italy for one night only and wanted to see this building. Though it wasn't open, we did enjoy walking the gardens in the evening and appreciating the exterior architecture.",
          "We did not purchase a ticket to visit inside the house, but we totally enjoyed viewing the architecture and the outdoor gardens.",
          "This fabulous complext, consisting of a main house, a smaller house, a Gardener's cottage, and an award-winning visitor center is also the epitome of Franks Lloyd Wright's Prairie School work. It has been painstakingly rebuilt and restored to the tune of over $50,000,000 (not a",
          "Really awesome site with great staff in the shop, at the desk and as guides. Our guide was a retired electric plant operator and part time actor who was awesome. His passion and knowledge for Wright and his work was obvious. Probably one of the best tours we've ever been on.",
          "We took the 2 hour tour on a Wednesday afternoon. I accidentally bought tickets online for the wrong day but the staff was able to accomodate me as there was room on that days tour. The docent was informative, there was a pretty good size crowd for the tour. We saw all the",
          "I did the one hour tour with my husband and his parents. They are all very much into FLW and so it was their idea. That being said, I very much enjoyed it! The complex is beautiful and the history and story behind it is very interesting. They were renovating the second floor of",
          "It is hard to imagine that this complex was constructed in the early 1900's with all the other styles of the time . It took quite a vision indeed . The craftsmanship and attention to detail explains why it was so much over budget",
          "Being British we knew little about FLW but found the tour most interesting and informative. We did the two hour tour which was taken by John who has a wealth of knowledge. We enjoyed seeing the 3 properties and actually staying in the area at the Parkside House.",
          "If you love to visit a FLW house wherever you travel, whenever possible and if you are in Buffalo, NY you will enjoy touring this FLW house. Each house has a unique story of the owner or owners that built and lived in the house. The Darwin House is a wonderful house and grounds",
          "A visit to Buffalo without a visit to the Darwin Martin means you have really missed a gem.There are other Frank Lloyd Wright sites in Buffalo worth seeing, but this is the crown jewel. The windows alone are worth the visit. Now the glasswork fireplace is finished. This house is",

          "We have been to many FLW buildings ; some several times. Except for Fallingwater this is our favourite. And it may even be a better restoration and example of his work. From the entranceway, to the stained glass and fireplace the attention to detail is superb. Combine it with a",

          "The restoration is coming along nicely. It's fun to go multiple times to see the progress. This is the peak of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie design. The coherence of the house design is just amazing. The buildings, the connected walkways, the furniture. Mr. Wright cared about",
          "If you are interested in architecture, then this is a must see. I took the 2 hour tour, with an interesting docent, and found it enthralling. There is a significant fee, $37, but a huge amount has been spent on restoring the house and for me it was well worth it.",
          "I happened to visit twice in the last month with different family members. The website is easy to navigate and book tours. Calling in advance is easy too and you can pay over the phone. There is no designated parking, but you can park anywhere on the street nearby, and I had no",
          "Built for a wealthy Buffalo mail-order soap baron, this Frank Lloyd Wright project is a stunningly modern design ideal. Painstakingly designed, crafted and restored. No expense or detail was spared. Built in 1915, this complex embodies the beginning of Frank Lloyd Wright's",

          "Unfortunately, we were in Buffalo on a Tuesday, the only day of the week that this amazing house is closed. However, we were still able to walk around the grounds and peek in various windows of the complex buildings. Just seeing the house is worth the visit and surely taking a",

          "Lovely example of Wright's early work, and the lifestyle of a successful businessman in Buffalo. We were able to tour the main living area, the gardens are being restored. The carriage house is a reproduction since the original was torn down by a previous owner. Some original",

          "The history of the Martin home is almost as interesting as the home itself. Changing hands over the years, each new owner seemed less capable of caring for a national treasure and it became so desparate at one point many of the stained glass windows were removed and sold. With",
          "Our tour guide Kathy was knowledgeable and proud to be a part of this program. We've been to Fallingwaters near Pittsburgh so it was interesting to see another example of Wright's work! Amazing restoration work!",
          "If you love mid century modern architecture and Frank Loyd Wright, you will LOVE the tour. My 12 yr daughter and I went on the one hr tour tour and wished we had done the two hr tour. I highly recommend it! The docent is very knowledgeable and they just finished a $45MM",
          "If you're a serious fan of Wright, the Darwin Martin House offers a bit of a quandary. On one hand, I respect immensely the amount raised to restore this house and the quality of the work. The last time I was here was 1990 and the place was a wreck with an apartment building",
          "The 2 hour tours sold out weeks in advance, so we took the one hour one. (Pre-booking is essential.) Lots to see and very well informed docent (and good questions from fellow visitors on our tour). No photos allowed inside. The Parkside Meadows is a nice little restaurant within",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. BE SURE TO BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE. We saw several people turned away who wanted to visit because the tours were sold out. We chose the 1-hour tour because we had young children (ages 12, 9, and 5), and that turned out to be a good",
          "We took the two hour tour. Book and buy tickets online as they sell out quickly. Our guide Jim was excellent and really cared about preserving the legacy. There is a nine minute movie that outlines the Martin's, Buffalo and Wright. There are some displays so arrive 1/2 hour",

          "My son, found this tour when we he was looking at things of interest in Buffalo for us to do on a recent family visit. I love the architectural style of Frank Lloyd Wright and history - when you combine this in a beautiful setting - with exercise (this is a walking tour) - it is",
          "I was very impressed with the restoration of the THREE houses in this complex. The docent was very knowledgeable and kept the tour moving along. Keep in mind that the second floor of the main house is under restoration at this time and the gardens are being recreated next",

          "The Darwin Martin House is an amazing architectural work. Frank Lloyd Wright was way ahead of his times and his work in today's world would challenge many. The tours of this facility are amazing. The docent's are well informed and weave the tour in a story format. At a few",

          "For the past few years this house has been undergoing renovations and it's well worth a visit. Furniture has been added which gives more of a feeling for the way the house looked originally. While it was closed, a number of objects had been removed and ended up in many museums",
          "Three of us went on the one-hour tour and were treated to a bounty of interesting facts, presented with both knowledge and passion. We were bowled over by the beautiful details that enhance Frank Lloyd Wright's amazing vision for this house. Our visit inspired one person in my",

          "This is a good tour of a home built by FLW for a Buffalo businessman in the early 1900's. It's cool to think about how the building was constructed. I studied the grains on the rift sawn oak, but I couldn't find a single joint or finish nail. There are over 8 miles of hand-built",

        "wiki": "The Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery is an art museum located at 1285 Elmwood Avenue, Buffalo, New York, in Delaware Park. The Albright-Knox's Elmwood Avenue campus is temporarily closed for construction. It is currently hosting exhibitions and events at Albright-Knox Northland, a project space located at 612 Northland Avenue in Buffalo\u2019s Northland Corridor. The new Buffalo Albright Knox Gundlach Art Museum is expected to open in 2022.\nThe gallery is a major showplace for modern art and contemporary art. It is located directly opposite Buffalo State College and the Burchfield Penney Art Center.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe parent organization of the Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery is the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, founded in 1862, one of the oldest public arts institutions in the United States. On January 15, 1900, Buffalo entrepreneur and philanthropist John J. Albright, a wealthy Buffalo industrialist, donated funds to the Academy to begin construction of an art gallery. The building was designed by prominent local architect Edward Brodhead Green. It was originally intended to be used as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, but delays in its construction caused it to remain uncompleted until 1905. When it finally opened its doors on May 31, 1905, it was named the Albright Art Gallery.\nClifton Hall, the third building on the museum's campus, was constructed in 1920 as the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences. Today, Clifton Hall houses the F. Paul Norton and Frederic P. Norton Family Prints And Drawings Study Center, the AK Innovation Lab, working spaces for the Public Art Initiative, and staff offices.\n\nIn 1962, a new addition was made to the gallery through the contributions of Seymour H. Knox, Jr. and his family, and many other donors. At this time the museum was renamed the Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery. The new building was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect Gordon Bunshaft, who is noted for the Lever House in New York City. The Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe museum first began discussing a possible expansion in 2001. In 2012, the board commissioned the architectural firm Sn\u00f8hetta to produce a master plan for future growth. In 2014, the board voted to initiate a museum expansion and, in June 2016, the museum announced its selection of OMA partner Shohei Shigematsu as the architect for the project. Doubleline CEO and Buffalo native Jeffrey Gundlach has pledged $42.5 million to the project, while businesses, foundations, government groups, and individuals have promised matching funds toward a $125 million goal.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIn 1978, the Gallery's exhibition on the work of Richard Diebenkorn was chosen to represent the United States at the 28th Venice Biennale. In 1988, the museum again won the competition to organize the exhibition representing the United States in Venice; the museum's curator Michael G. Auping proposed media artist Jenny Holzer.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery has long operated not by collecting artists' work in depth but by trying to acquire key works.  The gallery's collection includes several pieces spanning art throughout the centuries. Impressionistic and Post-Impressionistic styles can be found in works by artists of the nineteenth century such as Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.\nRevolutionary styles from the early twentieth century such as cubism, surrealism, constructivism are represented in works by artists like Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Joan Mir\u00f3, Piet Mondrian, and Alexander Rodchenko. Frida Kahlo is represented by Self-Portrait with Monkey. Because of Seymour H. Knox and Gordon M. Smith, a former director, the Albright-Knox was one of the first museums to collect Abstract Expressionism in depth.More modern pieces showing styles of abstract expressionism, pop art, and art of the 1970s through the end of the century can also be found represented by artists such as Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, and Andy Warhol. Additionally, the gallery is also rich in various pieces of post-war American and European art; their contemporary collection includes pieces by artists such as Kiki Smith, Allan Graham, Georg Baselitz, John Connell, and Per Kirkeby. The museum bought Anselm Kiefer's large-scale Die Milchstrasse (The Milkyway) (1985\u201387) in 1988 to celebrate its 125th anniversary.The Albright-Knox's current exhibition space can accommodate only 200 works \u2014 just 3% of its 6,740-piece collection.\n\n\n== Selected collection highlights ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Albright-Knox has more than 6,500 works in its collection, below is a list highlighting a few other notable paintings:\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nThe gallery contains a variety of sculptures on the exterior grounds. Some of the most notable, from the past and the present, include:\n\n\n== Deaccessioning and the Albright-Knox's mission ==\n\nIn 2007, the Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery deaccessioned a Roman-era bronze sculpture, Artemis and the Stag, that was auctioned at Sotheby's New York on June 7, 2007, and brought $28.6 million. This was the highest price ever paid at auction for an antiquity or a sculpture of any period, according to Sotheby's. It was purchased by the London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi on behalf of a private European collector.The event brought national attention to what until then had been a local question, the mission of the Albright-Knox. In February 2007, when the list of works to be deaccessioned was made public, Albright-Knox Director Louis Grachos defined the ancient sculpture as falling outside the institution's historical \"core mission\" of \"acquiring and exhibiting art of the present.\" This definition made public critics wonder whether the position at the Gallery of \"William Hogarth's Lady's Last Stake or Sir Joshua Reynolds' Cupid as a Link Boy were secure. Works by Gustave Courbet, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Jacques-Louis David and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix had been purchased by the museum in earlier decades.The decision to deaccession certain art works was made by a vote of the museum's Board of Directors, was voted on and ratified by the entire membership, and followed the guidelines of the American Alliance of Museums. The sale raised questions about how museums can remain vital when they are situated in economically declining regions and have limited means for raising funds for operations and acquisitions.\n\n\n== Hours ==\nThe gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday.  On the first Friday of each month, the gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. with free admission to the permanent collection through the support of M&T Bank.\n\n\n== Management ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nSince 2013, Janne Sir\u00e9n has been director of the Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery. Sir\u00e9n is believed to be the first director from the Nordic region to take the helm of a major American art museum.Complete list of directors:\n\nJanne Gallen-Kallela-Sir\u00e9n (2013\u2013present)\nLouis Grachos (2002-2013)\nDouglas G.

Since the proceeds from the sale of some 200 works of art in 2007 were added to the preexisting $22 million acquisitions endowment, the museum has been able to spend as much as almost $5 million on new art annually. In 2013, the Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery received an $11 million bequest from the estate of longtime board member and Buffalo arts patron Peggy Pierce Elfvin, possibly the largest single gift in the museum's history.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn J.

The area around the gallery is great too with cafes & restaurants not far in Elmwood Village & Delaware Park right across. \nWorth the drive!!",

          "A Buffalo cultural institution second to none, hand in hand with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra.  Both the perminant collection and exhibits are always worthy of a trip.  Spending a few hours here is easy, and when you're done (if it's summer), take a stroll through nearby Delaware Park or the Elmwood Village.",
          "Not a large collection on display, but a decent collection from major players in the art world. The building is easy to get around and the outside has also a small collection of modern sculpture. Adjacent to the museum is a small lake and garden grounds that offers a nice walk.",

The work itself, and the narrative that the exhibit creates around it is very poignant to many current events.  Highly recommend.",

It was hard to see the artwork in certain areas because the lighting was so yellow it altered the look of the artwork. Very poor quality for a museum with as many good works as this one.",

          "I suggest going in the summer as the outside has so much to offer. Inside is great too. A very nice pollock and some really nice oil paintings. Upstairs is a little extra on first fridays when it\u2019s free to most of the gallery. The best stuff however is upstairs. Mirrored room huge table room. If you enjoy art then it\u2019s cool.",
          "It's an art museum. It's pretty cool. \nThey've got some weird exhibits in here though. They've got like an entire floor dedicated to some dude obsessed with film. Like he deadass pickled film in a jar.",
          "Worth a pilgrimage. One of the strongest collections of modern and postwar art in the world, and set in the most beautiful grounds. I expect it'll only get better once their new wing for contemporary art is built!",
          "My favorite place to be- the exhibitions, the events, the food, the wine, everything and anything. We\u2019ve been members for years and we enjoy it so much!\n\nI also have to add, I am obsessed with scenic photography and this place is a sight to see during a sunset. My two all time favorite photos I\u2019ve taken are at the Albright.",

          "Located in the Albright section of Buffalo, this Art Gallery is a lovely one with it being the 5th oldest museum in the United States. With a variety of art and cool creations, there are paintings, creations, and lots of other stuff, as long as you follow staff instructions and NOT touch anything you will be alright.",
          "Great place for modern art as well as classics on display also. They are always changing up exhibits and bringing in new to keep things interesting. Great place to bring the kids, especially on the first Friday of the month is free admition. Art activities for the kids, and adults also.",

          "Be sure to get upstairs to view Anselm Keifer's work. Stunning.",
          "Clean and beautiful but under construction",
          "Wow, what a wonderful collection of ART.  Make sure you check out every corner, upstairs and downstairs areas.  We also had a really tasty lunch at the cafe located in the Museum.",
          "Nice gallery with changing exhibitions and themes. Well worth visiting. Free parking with ticket.",

          "The grounds alone, have stunning artwork. It's also a very popular spot for wedding pictures and Pokemon hunters!",
          "The art was extremely modern. There were about 20-30 old art paintings, but those were nice. The staff was rude when asking questions about where the exhibits were. The only art I actually enjoyed the most was the ones for sale in the gift shop! Very dissapointing...  Would not recommend",

          "Took a class of eager students there for a field trip.  They took them around and looked at 5 paintings.  The kids left with no real experience of what an art museum is.  Would not recommend it for any field trips.",

          "First place I took art lessons. Good blend of modern and classical . When in Buffalo, you must check it out.",
          "One of most overall beautiful elements of Elmwood and Buffalo in General.  The park being right there and the parkways it's all quite lovely.  Only have been inside three of four times but every time was pretty cool.  Would definitely recommend as a staple attraction for visitors.",

It is so great for Albright to open up its doors to non-members once a month. Being a member, I was able to bring them into the current exihibt for free. We enjoyed our morning there.",
          "Hidden gem!  It has a very good collection of art and regularly changes exhibits.  The traveling exhibits are particularly good.  There is a huge crowd on the First Fridays of each month (free admission).  But it is worth going on regular days, too to avoid the crowd.",
          "Our family LOVES the Albright-Knox! It's a must-visit for all Buffalovers out there- during any season!",
          "Really fun spot for a date night, especially when they have live jazz music and happy hour specials at the cafe",

          "World class art museum. Visited Buffalo from Louisiana mainly to visit the Albright-Knox.",

          "The displays constantly change and are just as engaging as the time before. Always something new to see and interact.",

          "I recently visited the Albright-Knox again, after over thirty years. And, it is every bit as wonderful as it was back then. It can be surprising to visitors that Buffalo has such a great collection of modern art. Though it cannot compete in size with similar museums in larger",

          "The building and grounds are gorgeous, as it was intended for use during for the Pan-Am, but due to delay, wasn't complete until 1905. The reason why I gave the Albright Knox a low rating is because they sold most of the beautiful, old artwork, which went so well with theme of",

          "My wife and I recently held our wedding reception here and our experience was wonderful.  We have gone to the Buffalo Museum of Science many times and when we found out that they can host weddings we had to check it out.  As soon as we did, \u2026",
          "Went to see the golden mummies. The exhibit was just average and there were so many stroller pushers getting in your way with children too small to enjoy such an exhibit. The rest of the museum is hands-on for small children like a giant \u2026",
          "It was the first time I came here\n and I enjoyed the Egyptian exhibit very much. The other displays in the other rooms were nicely done.",
          "We were excited to have an afternoon off. So we took a day to see the Golden Mummy's.. we weren't disappointed..",
          "Gone to the museum to see the Mummy exhibit that was on loan from Manchester. Loved it. There are activities for kids. Recommend a visit.",
          "The golden  mummies  are on exhibit  till sometime in spring, a must see if you are into anything  related  to mummies  and that period  in history. Always  something  new to learn. 16 dollars  for seniors &milatary,  19 for  adults, check for children  costs.  Also the artifact  exhibit  is a must see too.",
          "A beautiful museum with lots to see and do. Mainly self guided as any good museum should be. Also very reasonably priced.",
          "Awesome place. First time there and I have lived in Buffalo for 46 years. There is so much to do and see and learn there.",
          "The science after dark theme nights are a lot of fun. I haven't been to the museum before, but it is very cool. A good size and there are a lot of very cool exhibits. The space area is very cool.",
          "We did a painting with metal paints which was fun. It was affordable and interesting. However, the place itself was confusing to navigate. Its a cool place and I'll definitely visit again.",
          "Several good, well-presented exhibits combined with a lot of seemingly disjointed corporate-sponsored niche exhibits that are scattered throughout the floors. The interactive exhibits seem to be headed toward small children but handle subjects and concepts well beyond the comprehension of the same target audience.",
          "We did the 21 and over Christmas craft event, I would definitely do it again. The staff were helpful and friendly as well.",
          "A stunning place.  Please visit and enjoy!",
          "Just the right amount of entertainment for my 7yr and 1yr old and they rotate it enough that theres always something new when we go. Also, I forgot our stroller and thought I'd have to carry my infant, nope! They have free strollers and \u2026",
          "Great variety of things for children to do! I have been going since I was a child and Absolutely the best museum around!",
          "Went to see the golden mummies of Egypt traveling exhibit. Never have had the opportunity to view funerary items dating before the birth of Christ....Extraordinary!",
          "Always a nice place to visit.  No matter how many times I go I always discover some new thing that I swear wasn't there last time. My children never fall to be amazed by the exhibits.  The most awesome part is that because I live in the \u2026",
          "This place is great for families looking for something to do on a rainy day. There are 3-4 floors all depending on what time you go the observatory might not be open. Even if it isn\u2019t open the other three floors are great. You have \u2026",
          "best place for kids in buffalo area. so much fun and learned a lot.",
          "Buffalo Museum of Science is an extremly engaging place with some fantastic displays and activities for a wide range of age groups.  My children and I love this place, it makes for a great morning out.",
          "This museum particularly educate me and family about many things, especially for the life of animals, some part of our anatomy, and the space with how the smell of other planets. You may alson learn about motion and achestors' tools for survivals.",
          "This place was amazing! We are from Cleveland and were passing through the area. We only had a few hours but were blown away with the amount of interactive exhibits for the kids to do. Will definitely come back when we have more time to explore!",
          "A great place to spend the afternoon.   Fun activities for the little ones and plenty for the adults",
          "So much fun, great learning fun for all ages my fav place and I come from 5.5 hrs away..",

          "Really loved this place as a kid, and now my kids love it too! This place has stuff for all age groups.",
          "Quite crowded because of the Golden Mummies exhibit, but overall very enjoyable. Took our 11 yr. old granddaughter!",
          "This is a lovely museum. Interesting pieces and much to learn. The play areas for the kids are really cool and spread throughout the museum. You can easily spend a day here and still have things to do on a next visit. Each area is also big enough and spread out that kids aren't piled on top of each other or waiting in lines.",
          "The golden mummies exhibit is great and the rest of the museum content is wonderful tool",
          "First time visitor but seems like a lot of recent updates. Enjoyed it for the reasonable admission",
          "Good place for this kids ..had a membership last year for it so I can have a place for the winter to take the kids",
          "It's a great place, mostly for kids to explore and learn about nature, history and science. I wish it was more interactive for kids. Overall a good visit!",
          "It's a really great place to spend an afternoon. Lots to learn and a lot of fun and interactive exhibits",
          "The museum is always great. My kids love the first floor pump display. The water exhibition is their second favourite. I can't wait to see what they are doing with the gift shop it was under construction last time we went. The Lego exhibit we bought tickets to was amazing!",
          "Is just a good experience love it thanks for everything I hope to comeback",
          "A wonderful place to visit and learn. So many interactive exhibits in good repair, and so much to do. We intended to spend a couple of hours and instead we spent the whole day.",

          "The museum is wonderful! We are members and come here often. The kids find something new every time we come.",
          "My kids and I love the variety of hand on activities to choose from.",
          "Not a bad place to visit. It would be nice if there were more interactive displays.",
          "This was an interesting museum, but it was pretty small and did not take much time to work through. I wish that it was a bit larger and less child focused, but that is just my personal preference. Otherwise it was nice and they had demonstrations for the kids to see.",
          "Amazing exhibits and a fun place for children and adults of all ages. There\u2019s something for everyone.",
          "This was a great find on our way through town and finding that they honor reciprocal membership with our local museum was even better. Our 3 year old engaged on every floor, so much so that we missed the younger kids area all together! Bonus points for the family care room as a nice quiet calm space.",
          "Newest exhibit is lovely, movie showed was cute too especially in 3D",
          "One of the best and most memorable museums I have ever been to due to the large selection of relics and history. What made it truely memorable however was the staff that gave me and interactive experience which was unique and immersive that shaped who I am now. I want to thank them for the experiences whenever I visited!",
          "Kids always have a blast and we got a seasons pass so we go alot",
          "We had a great time!!!  We didn't see the mummy exhibit but we still had fu n.",
          "We love the science museum! Only reason for 4 stars is that there phone system is bad and it\u2019s really hard to talk to an actual person with questions if you ever have any.",
          "I always loved going as a kid but taking my kids there and seeing how much they enjoyed it was even better. My husband and I had just as much fun as every kid. Still an awesome place <3",
          "The Mummies were AWESOME! Just a sneak peak...",
          "I am 69 yrs old and been visiting this museum since 1955, when it was a free place to visit on a Sunday for my parents with 4 kids.  Loved it then, and it's quality hasn't changed!",
          "Many exhibits are closed, exhibits are worn and shabby.  During our visit (a Wednesday afternoon) we were often the only visitors on any of the 4 floors. Mostly a disappointing experience. Lots of stuff for tiny kids though, so if you have young children up to age 8 or so, they might be entertained.",
          "Great place. A lot of nifty things to see and info. Went on Space Day so there was even more to enjoy. Could have been a little more clear on where the space stuff was exactly.",
          "Good place to go lots to see and do for kids and adults",
          "The BMS has greatly improved; many more opportunities to have hands-on experiences for kids.  My daughter loves the Human Body hall and the weather/engineering space on the third floor. I do not seem to see as many docents outside of the main hall, however.",
          "Good turn of the century science museum. Modernizing but still retains the old collection.",
          "Plenty to do! We went early, not a huge crowd so it was nice for my 2 year old to run and see everything. Staff was friendly and engaging.",
          "This is a great place to take the family with lots to see and do. Lots of interactive exhibits. And they just recently updated their telescope which I cant wait to use. They have some Buffalo themed things on display such as ,\"Stuffy \" a Buffalo Iconic part of history. It's a clean and fun place for all to enjoy.",
          "Marvelous mummy exhibit",
          "We were visiting from out of town and were looking for a way to spend a few hours before we had to catch our flight. The museum had a lot of hands on experiences for children. Our son loved the dinosaur exhibit, the bug exhibit and the \u2026",
          "Escorted my son on a feild trip here had a blast",
          "Exhibits seem a little dated, but would be fine for kids. There seem to be truly exceptional interactive, play-like opportunities for very young children",
          "I\u2019ve always loved the museum ever since I was young although not much has changed;there is always something new to learn",
          "Well worth it. Had a blast!",
          "Great place to take the kids. Lots of fun exhibits and things to see and do. Also a lot of cool stuff for adults. Possible to learn a lot during a visit! The Lego exhibit was fantastic. Highly recommend!",
          "Excellent place to bring little ones. It's much bigger than we thought it would be. Adults can have some fun too with some of interactive games.",
          "Much more geared to children than I had assumed (I\u2019ve been to science museums in London and Halifax and they were suitable for adults, too) but still interesting nonetheless!",
          "Good fun interactive displays good for people of all ages. Would definitely recommend to anyone going through Buffalo.",
          "Kids really enjoyed the time here.. think it was $14 a person so very reasonable. Nice exhibits",
          "It was allot of fun for our young boys. The hurricane box was a big hit as always.",
          "It's too modern/fast food/mtv feeling for me",
          "Lots of fun, interesting and educational things for my kids (9 and 12yo). The cafe is really just snacks, not a good option for lunch.",
          "My only complaint is i remember the mummy exhibit being way better as a kid.  I miss the nostalgic feeling. But other than that it was nice.  Of course the kid loved it.  Took us about an hour.  Wish there was a little more to it.",
          "We came here for the Art of the Brick for a belated birthday present for my 3 year old. I loved it more than he did, but he liked the play area. The museum is way bigger than it seems it will be, and there's a lot of really nice exhibits. \u2026",
          "Awesome place to take your kids when you are visiting south of the border. Check out the dinosaur exhibit.",
          "Oh My Goodness...So Exciting the Upgrades are breathtaking..felt just like a child full of excitement and wonder once you step behind these walls. A New Updated variety with a hint of the familiar will keep children and adults of all ages entertained for hours. Better Deals with a Membership good for a full year\ud83d\ude09",
          "Fantastic museum. Lots of interactive exhibits.",
          "Interesting, diverse exhibits, lots of hands-on exhibits. Great place to take kids.",
          "They are doing wonderful things at the museum.  The special exhibits are great to see and interact with. The volunteers were very friendly and willing to help with any question. The museum is physically challenged friendly, with an elevator and benches for resting. Definitely worth the trip!",
          "It was nice. Had a lot of interesting stuff there. Unfortunately I went when they had 2 different sections closed down. Kind of annoyed there was no information about it, and kind of annoyed that I had to pay $26 to get into a museum that I  couldn't FULLY enjoy (it's $13 per person) but oh well. What I did get to see was really cool.",
          "Great time.. the Lego exhibit was great.. staff was friendly and informative only complaint is a fee exhibits were not functioning properly. But still had fun!!! Definitely take your family here rainy day or sunny day it's fun!!",
          "The place is quite interesting; it has a section on extincted animals according to the eras. There is an area that shows Biodiversity and a last area on the third floor that shows a botanics, medicine, physics and other. Truly fascinating! \u2026",
          "Nice museum in the heart of Buffalo NY. Exhibits were excellent and informative. Would give 5 stars if all the exhibits were open.",
          "It's a really nice place, just very rarely or never updated with new things to see. Would recommend going though, there is a lot of activities to do here!",
          "We didn't have much time, but the exhibits that we saw were pretty good.",
          "Excellent place to bring little ones. It's much bigger than we thought it would be. Adults can have some fun too with some of interactive games.",
          "My kids and I have been members of the museum for 7 years. My kids have loved it here from the time they were toddlers, and they are now 6 and 8 and still enjoy it. The museum has been making efforts to bring in new hands on exhibits and the travelling exhibits that change a few times a year are always excellent.",
          "Fun for younger kids , but it's a little dated",
          "what a great place to take the kids. Only do they learn what they have fun when they play with soft while learning and it doesn't even feel like they're learning and it's so interesting they're my wife and I and our daughter went there when they had the Lego exhibit and it was amazing we paid a little extra but it was so worth it",
          "It's very fun for kids not so much for adults. Haven't been to the movie theater",
          "I think it's worth to visit this museum.  The second floor is my favorite. Lots of kids play there.",
          "An amazing experience whether it is your first visit or your 100th lots to do and explore.",
          "Lots of interesting exhibits, and lots of interactive activities for the kids, good times!",
          "I went for the Lego exhibit which was great. The other typical museum stuff (fossils, artifacts, etc.) was interesting as well and well-presented. There were a few other exhibits, but they seemed mostly oriented toward young children. Also, \u2026",
          "We have been here twice with the family.  It's a nice local museum.  Not the biggest or most action packed place, but it's a nice place to spend a few hours with smaller children.  It is spread out over several floors so you don't feel \u2026",
          "Perfect family outing or a unique place to get work done for work-at-home parents. Four floors full of fun activities. Downstairs toddler area is perfect for young children and toddlers. Quiet room to the side ideal for nursing, spending \u2026",
          "We took our toddler on a rainy day and although many of the exhibits went over her head, she had a great time running around, getting hands-on with exhibits, pushing buttons & generally becoming science'd! Well laid out and worth the \u2026",
          "Pretty awesome museum with tons to see and learn about",
          "The museum is big and my kids love it. There are a lot of interesting areas and it takes a couple trips to see everything. They do seem to have a lot of unused space, but that might allow for additional exhibits. The museum has always been clean and well-staffed on our visits.",
          "Great for kids.  The day we visited was very busy, and still had a great time",
          "Many of their exhibits are interactive in some way. Lots of good learning and fun for the kids.",
          "This museum is a very fun and a pleasant interactive expirience for all ages and contains many interesting historical artifacts as well as many different stations for the sciences, my favorite being the science of sound and the heart room. \u2026",
          "I am still kid at heart...love the new exhibits",
          "Fun place to take your family too",
          "Had a great time at the Wreathed in Reading event. This was an adult craft event of which they apparently have quite frequently here! Who knew!? Not that I do I will be paying more attention. Haven't been here since I was a kid. Also on the \u2026",
          "Went with my son's first grade class for a field trip! We had so much fun! There was lots to do! I would definitely recommend it for a rainy day when theres not much to do!",
          "We went an hour before close on a Sunday. We were able to complete in that amount of time. For what it is, it was fun to do. However, compared to pretty much any other city it is quite underwhelming. Would love for more funding to go here as this would be an ideal tourist spot to bring people to the East side/medical campus area.",
          "Always fun for all ages. Never too busy, and the exhibits are entertaining and educational.",
          "Good Museum! Exhibits are cool! Some cool interactive stuff to do and there is something for all ages. Smaller in size but that is good because you can get though everything in one day! The space exhibit was cool and is newly renovated.The \u2026",
          "Very descriptive and productive exhibit perfect for children",
          "My kids love all the interactive exhibits",

          "Decent value for the money. Just do not expect the breadth of exhibits of Imaginarium San Fransisco or fun hands on exhibits of Baltimore science museum. There are some started animals like in natural history museum and some hands on \u2026",
          "The observatory is perhaps one of the best places to visit in the city, I was really fascinated with what I saw in this museum, it is interesting to know a little of the paleontological era, the dinosaur fossils and other interesting things you can find here make you feel a quite small being in the universe.",
          "My first visit in almost 50 years revealed many new, creative and fun displays, and brought back fond memories. Buffalo can be proud of its rededication to an educational treasure.",
          "The Lego exhibit was extremely popular and well done. My advice? Don't miss it.\nI also particularly enjoy the fossils.  There are many other photo ops as well.",
          "Surprised by the sheer size of the place. At first we were unimpressed by the outside. The first floor only has a couple displays and the checkin counter and coat room. Then we climbed to the second floor and were blown away. The first room \u2026",
          "I always enjoy going to the Science Museum. I love teaching my children new things and allowing them to learn hands on. There's always so much to do with our family membership. We are looking forward to visiting the observation tower soon.",
          "Came for Niagara Falls and spent a day at the museum.  My kids ages 12, 8, and 5 all loved the museum and we easily spent a full day there.  Great place.",
          "Summary provided at the top; full review provided below.\n\nSummary\nPros:\n-Lots of interesting content to digest.\n-Reasonable prices.\n-Good activity for groups, especially with interactive items.\nCons:\n-Occasional interactive items broken \u2026",

          "Was a fun place to go and kill some time highly recommended. People were very polite.",

          "Nice for kids of all ages.  Very interactive and not crowded.",
          "Probably my favorite place in Buffalo.  The museum has a variety of interesting permanent and rotating exhibits, lots of interactivity, and great staff.  Their After Hours events are excellent as well.",
          "I really like the interactive sections. Hands on ways to learn for kids and adults. Would recommend getting there early on weekends as it fills up quickly. And bringing food from home as their cafeteria had no food options and closed at 12:30.",
          "Not too expensive. Tons of different exhibits to look through at your own pace. It wasn't too crowded during the visit but we went off hours. Definitely a place to bring children, there are tons of activities and hands-on experiences.",
          "During the week from 2 - 4 is the perfect time to see the Art of the Brick exhibit. It's usually full of children and other guess but this time slot is perfect for an art lover to take in the exhibit piece by piece.",
          "Lots to see. Overwhelming for a four year old. Could spend several hours here.",
          "Excellent experience!  Just not enough time in the day to see it all.  Going back to see the rest.",
          "Very clean and organized. Exhibits are clearly defined and intriguing. It's a place that excites my five year olds eyes and teaches me in need to learn more",
          "The Buffalo Museum of Science is a great place to take you\u2019re kids and for people who like science. It has so many facts about science and there is a souvenir gift shop. It has a couple great entertainment activities for kids. Kids will have a blast there.",
          "Brought my kids here and had a blast. Great interactive exhibits.",
          "Had a great time at the Museum with my hubby. The Lego exhibit really brought out the kid in us! Would definitely recommend this to families as it is beautiful and stimulating to the mind!",
          "Great museum. Lots to see and do. Hands on things for the kids to do.",
          "Seeing the mummies was an something that everyone should see. You have to see it person.",

          "The Science Museum has plenty to see for people of literally any age. So much to see and learn, highly recommended!",
          "It was excellent. A bit too many kid activites and as I am not a kid nor do I have kids that was cool but not for me. If you have kids this place is 6 stars.",
          "Great displays Awesome Myseum",
          "Nice visit over there. A lot of things to explore and see. First Level not attracting. Often not clear if skeletons are authentic or replica. Additional exhibitions with extra entrance fee also like theatre. This should be included. Lots if posibilities for kids, families, classes. Plans for orientation only digital at certain points.",
          "Great place to bring kids in the summer! Make sure to plan for more time on the upper levels. We spent quite a bit of time exploring the first floor but there are more interactive exhibits on floors 2-3. One particular employee was awesome! Really went out of his way to explain things and make us feel welcomed.",
          "Fun museum, really good for kids",
          "This has been one of my favorite WNY locations since I was a kid.",

          "Great costumer service.",
          "Went to see the Lego exhibit.  Was amazing and my niece and nephew loved it.  Well worth seeing .",
          "Alot of interactive things for the children to mess around with. Have different exhibits spread out across 4 floors. It is definitely very family friendly and based more for the children aspect instead of the normal adult museums of artifacts and teading.",
          "It was awesome, though a little chaotic, because the museum was not fully prepared for the amount of visitors they received during the public schools winter break week and their LEGO Exhibit!!! The onslaught of hundreds of little scientists was incredible, but navigable.",
          "So many activities for my 5 grandchildren 6 and 7 year olds with 3D movies",

          "So many things to do for kids of all ages",

          "Lots of fun and really cool exhibits",
          "Came to see The Art of the Brick Lego exhibit and it was awesome. Didn't mind spending time looking at the old classic exhibits again either.",
          "Loved the Friday adult night we went to. Petted a tarantula and played with the hands on exhibits. The permanent exhibits were okay. Most of the computer interactive exhibits weren't calibrated/ didn't work.",
          "Learn a lot nice place",
          "Good, educational spot. Good for the kids as well.",
          "I decided to bring my kids here for an educational tour. I am happy that the Museum is now modernized unlike to my previous visit when I am younger. My kids were fascinated with the animal and the dinosaur exhibits. They know every name \u2026",
          "Family friendly place! The membership is a good value for local families. It\u2019s an excellent thing to do when the weather isn\u2019t great.",
          "I bought my girlfriend a stuffed dog at this gift store and she's still sleeps with it every night over 3 years later",
          "Love the Buffalo Science Museum. Just wish they'd get with the times a little and use social media. Their Instagram is just the occasional picture of a rock or a bug - no mention of their big exhibits, events, or anything else engaging.",
          "So much  to see! Definitely  reccomend stopping in here !",
          "Truly incredible experience.",
          "I've always loved the science museum. Whether it's to see a new exhibit or to view what they normally have exhibited it's well worth a visit",
          "This has always been a great place to go and take the grandchildren. This past Saturday we went to specifically see the movies. The first movie regarding the flying dinosaurs was very poor quality and the sound wasn't very good either. \u2026",
          "Always have a good time here. Most recent trip was when the Lego display was here. What an awesome experience.",
          "Not much their for adults and the mummy exhibit wasn't what I anticipated it to be.",
          "Great family outing! Kids love the different exhibits. Worth the yearly membership, great for rainy days or any day.",

          "Great way to entertain children for a day.  It's a shame the exhibit that included the green screen and other very interactive displays is closed, as it was a favorite.  Saw the Flying Monsters movie and was disappointed the sound mix was \u2026",

          "Terrific experience for adults and the kids. The exhibits are really terrific and the variety of them is appreciated.",
          "This museum was a disappointment, it\u2019s probably more of a children\u2019s amusement place more than anything. It\u2019s not fun nor interesting for young adults like my husband and I. Wouldn\u2019t recommend, it\u2019s plain and small with repetitive exhibits",
          "I loved it and so did kids! It was our first time there and worth every minute. Parking can be a little tricky though.",

          "Disappointing. Many of the artifacts in the one section had numbers on them but nothing to tell you what you were looking at. The same thing in the biodiversity section. A while group of animals had no names attached to them. Shame on the \u2026",

          "Visited here by chance while we were in Buffalo. Great time for children and adults. A lot of fun, interactive things to do for adults and children to do. My children ages are from 11 to 17 and they loved it. Reasonable admission prices and free parking. Recommended if you",
          "We had a GREAT time. We loved the health-science area on the 2nd floor, and then spent close to two hours on the 3rd floor. The hands-on interactive displays were wildly popular with our children. Well worth the visit! (The restrooms could use some assistance, but far",
          "Visited this museum with 10 teenagers visiting from out of town. They enjoyed the exhibits and lasted for about 2.5 hours. The museum has a good amount of interactive exhibits. There are sections on extinct animals, insects, wildlife and nature, building things like cardboard",
          "I am unsure how to advise on this museum. It is definitely not on my list of favorite science museums. Several of the interactive displays were not working. The docents were very nice, but the entire experience was unremarkable. There is definitely great potential, and if one",
          "We loved this museum. We took our five-year-old on a weekend trip here and to Niagara Falls and this is what he is still talking about. We started with a 3D movie which was very neat (although the 3D glasses were really dirty). My son then threw himself into all of the exhibits",
          "Fun for the kids while they learn. Good size but not too large. Easy to navigate and interactive for kids",
          "Very interesting place to visit for all ages. I know that many of the exhibits are dedicated to children but there are lots of interesting things for the parents or grandparents like us to enjoy. I especially enjoyed the forests video speaking in the first person as to how",
          "We've been to numerous birthday parties here at the museum and we also get annual passes for our family of 3. There are always fun things going on and new exhibits to see. Their yearly Bubble Fest is always a blast. The kids will find something to do and touch in every room.",
          "Took our 5-year old and our 8-year old to spend the day at the Science Museum. Amazed that they don't charge for parking. This isn't a particularly large museum, but it had plenty of interactive displays and exhibits to keep the kids occupied for hours. Had to drag them away",
          "My children recently attended a birthday party at the Buffalo Museum of Science. I was pleasantly surprised with the party and the kids really enjoyed being able to watch/see live science experiments right in front of them. The rooms were very nice and you could bring in any",
          "We came to the museum after it started to rain at the zoo. The toddler play room was great. Our son loved the water table and the large building blocks. There is a family room which is great for nursing moms or a fussy baby. There are also several places to eat a packed lunch.",
          "Staff is nowhere to be seen. They act as if you are bothering them to ask for help. Really didn't appreciate how the staff talked about kids and visitors.",
          "We are members of The Buffalo Museum of Science. We love to take the kids there on a rainy day to explore the wonderful kids room they have. They especially love the water table they have there. They do not want to leave. My only complaint is with the people I come into",
          "My husband and I visited the Buffalo Museum of Science and enjoyed the exhibits. They have a great exhibit of birds and animals. There are a lot of interactive activities. The staff was very friendly. The entrance fee for seniors is $8.00 and the parking was free.",

          "So much to explore and learn about - fun for ages 2 yrs to adult. Plenty of room to explore and reasonably priced. This is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon afternoon with the kids or grand-kids. It's fun and very interesting for everyone.",
          "We used the \"reciprocal benefits\" from our local museum to get in free, and with free parking, we had nothing to lose! We hadn't been to a science museum in a while and my kids are older (11, 12 and 14) so I wasn't sure how interested they'd be, but they really had fun. We were",
          "Just moved to the area and my son wanted to check out the Museum. He is 17 years old and found it to be a bit boring for his age. There were lots of interactive displays for children (preteen and younger) to have hand-on experiences. We watched the robot 3D movie, which was",
          "Spent a couple of hours here with my spouse and 3 children under 12. Many interesting hands-on interactive displays. Then saw the 3D Robots film which is highly recommended. The best thing according to my boys was the lack of crowds as they are used to museums in munch larger",
          "The museum provided interactive exhibits and was educational and fun for the whole family. The James Cameron Deepsea Challenge 3D movie was very inspirational. ISEP conference was presenting today, which was an added bonus. Its wonderful seeing children so engaged in learning",
          "The museum of science is an asset to the Buffalo area. It is a good mid-sized museum with a new hands on kids area, great visiting exhibits, and a quality permanent exhibit. The best part though, are the family opportunities, like Discovery Camps and Night at the Museum",
          "The Science Museum has exhibits of interest for all ages. There is a great \"hands-on\" play/learning area on the first floor for the younger children. It is a great place to spend the day with or without children. The museum has \"regular\" exhibits and special events type exhibits",
          "We visited the Buffalo Museum for Energy Day. My kids, 6 and 7, had a great time running from exhibit to exhibit. The staff was great and there were crafts and hands on activities for the kids. Definitely pack a lunch as we did. The cafe inside is really small and the food is a",

          "This museum isn't the largest you've ever seen, and you can easily do the entire building in a single visit. But it is interesting, and the kids will enjoy the tour because there are a lot of \"hands-on\" activities within. Each floor of this place focuses on a different area of",
          "Our four girls ages 12, 8, 6 and 4 had a ball at here! - and we parents did as well. We had to tear them away after 3 hours to go get something to eat. We went on a Saturday and the crowd was so small it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The following were exhibit",
          "it was so much fun! there are so many hands on things to do. There are great things for everyone. Adults and Children. If you are an Adult this place would definitely bring out the child in you. great place for science people",

          "This museum is attached to a school. Many of the place you will walk looks like a school. At first we weren't really impress and thought we might get bored. But it wasn't the case. We stay about 2 hours there. Many of the exposition had interactivities and both adults and",

          "My friend and I took my four young grandsons here last Friday upon a recommendation from my son and daughter in law who had just discovered it. We had a great time! Easy to find, easy parking, some issues getting an annual grandparent pass as the nice gentleman on the register",
          "The Buffalo Museum of Science tries to appeal to multiple types of people but isn't particularly great at anything. Most of the building attempts to be like a science center that caters to families, but the exhibits are basic and not really interesting to anyone but small",
          "This is a great place for kids and adults to visit. There are a lot of hands on exhibits where the parents can interact with their kids. There is a 3D theatre with three different videos that the whole family will enjoy. If you are a member it is only $2 and $4 for",
          "We stopped at this museum as a rest stop of sorts for our young kids while we were on a car trip. The museum is part of the ASTC, so our membership at our local science center gave us admission here. The museum had a lot of exhibits that our 4 year-old and 2 year-old really",
          "Our family has been to many science centers and children's museums around the country and unfortunately this was one of the worst. The exhibits were average, but what stood out to me was the attitude of the employees. Every single one of them acted as if we were a huge bother",
          "The museum is not so big but has some spectacular exhibits for kids. Experiences about the degrees of earthquakes, wind sppeds from breeze to tornado, soil erosion, solar power, electricity generation via dams, windmills, levers and motion, and the best was the space. Exhibits",
          "They have some game for children, also adult. it make us have a funny way to learn and get educate. it is good for parents and kids. =)",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I we excited to go the the science museum, but we're disappointed. It's not as big as we'd hoped and it's more for kids than adults. We had an ok time but it left something to be desired.",
          "This is a super little museum. The new exhibits are excellent, and the temporary exhibits are always great. We recently returned to visit the Curious George exhibit and was again pleasantly surprised by all that the museum had to offer and how much fun we all had. It isn't",
          "Today my husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old son to the Curious George Exhibit at the Buffalo Museum of Science. It was a great experience for the whole family. Easy (on a Saturday) to get in, fairy inexpensive (except the gift shop) and my son who has mild autism had a ball!",
          "the Museum is great educationally and your kids will love it but bring wet wipes. Everything has a nice layer of grime on it the place seriously needs to be scrubbed. From the halls to the exhibit pieces almost everything in the building is sticky and covered in dirt. I have",
          "I have lived in Western NY my whole life and don't remember ever going here until now. I went with my brother, niece and nephew (ages 6 and 3) for a winter's day outing. The kids loved it and I also found it very enjoyable. The Curious George exhibit was very cute and the museum",
          "A lot of installations about any science. Physics, biology, bugs, history, prehistory, space, you name it. I went there on a Sunday alone, for a geek like me it was a well spent 3h. With kids I would have spent a lot more. The place is really well geared towards kids of all",

          "I went with my daughter & 2 children & was so glad I read the reviews before me. This is not the largest museum by any means but the kids did not want to leave. They can build a snowflake model, experience hurricane or tornado winds, learn about the planet's etc. There was a",
          "We had a great time at the mummies of the world exhibit. They had an exspensive collection of specimens. It was great for adults and children and the price was reasonable. Not a massive museum but a great way to spend an afternoon!",
          "For my birthday, my husband and I went to the museum. We're in our late 20s/early 30s and we had such FUN! All of the exhibits were really well done and I love the interactive features. Great photo opportunities and we both learned a lot. We loved the heart rate game,",
          "This is a must visit for anyone who lives, works or is traveling through Buffalo. Well laid out and extremely interactive. It's also large enough that any wait time is small to use a hands on exhibit. We were so impressed that we bought a family membership on the spot - and",
          "Really fun place for all ages. One of the few places I can bring my autistic granddaughter. She absolutely loves all the interactive exhibits. Whether it be dinosaurs, outer space or mummies that interest you, there is something for you at this museum. We spent hours there",
          "Great time for all ages. Even a great toddler area on the first floor. Well worth the cost of admission. We will be back again especially during winter months.",
          "Great, interactive and fun museam that our kids spent all day at. Even if your child is interested in reading about the exhibits, the interaction is well-worth their time. We will be going back soon for sure.",

          "On a trip to Buffalo, I had an afternoon to kill and five children, from 14 to 6 years old, to entertain. On the suggestion of my sister, who lived in Buffalo, we went to the Buffalo Museum of Science. Being from a small town in South Alabama, we don't have many museums to go",
          "My young kids love Buffalo museum of science. It's their favorite place to visit in Buffalo. Parents may agree with the opinion that small but decent museum is the best place for both kids and parents. This place is for young kids enough to enjoy for more than 2 hours. If you",

          "When they have special exhibits we love to go. We went the first time years ago just to see the place. It was a good time. Years later we came back to see Mummies of the World and we were kinds disappointed to see that nothing new was there. There are a lot of things for kids to",
          "I love this place! Every time I go I learn something new! This place is great for kids as well! There is so much to do and see. I love the mummies and the astronomy part on the top floor. So many memories were made here when I was a kid and I can't wait to make more every time",
          "I visit a lot of museums all over the world so I wasn't expecting Buffalo to have such a modern well put together museum but it really impressed me. I went with a friend to see the mummies exhibit which was a nice overview of the subject but a lot of information I already knew",
          "My friends recommended that I take my children to see the Mummies of the World exhibit. Coming from the So. Tier of NY, I really didn't know what to expect. I will admit that we had admission price shock. With five of us, it emptied out my wallet. Adults were $22 Food is",

        "wiki": "Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site preserves the Ansley Wilcox House, at 641 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, New York.  Here, after the assassination of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office as President of the United States on September 14, 1901.  A New York historical marker outside the house indicates that it was the site of Theodore Roosevelt's Inauguration.\n\n\n== Property history ==\n\nThe oldest part of the National Historic Site includes the lone surviving structure from the Buffalo Barracks compound.  Due to tensions between the U.S. and Anglo-Canada, a military post was constructed to ensure border security.  Built in 1839, the post encompassed all the land from Allen Street to North Street and Delaware Ave to Main Street.  The structure that would later be incorporated into the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site started life in 1840 as the Barrack's officer's quarters.\nAfter the post was disbanded in 1845, the home reverted to a private residence.  Subsequent owners continued to modify the structure adding and demolishing out structures and additions.  In the late 19th century, Dexter Rumsey gave the property to his son-in-law Ansley Wilcox and his wife Mary Grace Rumsey.  The newest inhabitants made extensive renovations to the structure.  Plans of these renovations are still on file at the Historic Site.\n\n\n=== Inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt ===\n\nIn 1901, while attending the Pan-American Exposition, anarchist Leon Czolgosz twice shot President William McKinley.  Although early doctor's reports on the President's condition were positive, McKinley's condition soon worsened. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt rushed back to Buffalo, but arrived only after McKinley had died.\n\nIt was decided to conduct the inauguration immediately due to the tragic and politically charged circumstances of President McKinley's death.  The most appropriate site was determined to be the Wilcox home.  Approximately 50 dignitaries, family members and cabinet officials gathered in the front library for the inauguration.  Federal Judge John R. Hazel administered the oath.  No photographic image exists of the ceremony itself, although the room was heavily photographed after the inauguration had concluded.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe Wilcoxes continued to live in the home until their deaths in the 1930s.  The home's furniture was sold at a public auction and the property became the Kathryn Lawrence Restaurant.  The proprietors removed interior walls, demolished a carriage house, and painted many of the finished wood surfaces before the restaurant ceased operations in 1961.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe first part of the house is a museum displaying many items from the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, including wine glasses, plates, playing cards, and the key to the Temple of Music.  The last room is a recreation of the office Roosevelt used during his presidency, and includes an interactive desk which can be used to send e-mails to yourself.\n\n\n== Administrative history ==\nThe National Historic Site was authorized on November 2, 1966.  As an historic area administered by the National Park Service, it was automatically listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe National Parks: Index 2001\u20132003.

          "very cool tour lots of information from very knowledgeable volunteers!",
          "I liked it. There is a slightly different approach as the museum tries to make the experience a bit more interactive, putting you \"back in the day.\" A bit corny and it keeps the docents on a tight script, but I sure did learn a lot about Teddy.",
          "A lovely restored building with incredible artifacts. The site staff are very friendly and helpful!",

          "This is a very well done museum. The displays are a good mix of interactive with more text heavy pieces, appealing to all ages. Great tour guides. I think anyone can take something away from this place. One of the better (though shorter) historic tours I've been on in recent",
          "A visit to the TR Inauguration site really does not take long. You can enjoy it in under 90 minutes. The time will be well spent. To stand in the same room where a great man once stood under horrific circumstances and assumed the presidency is deeply moving and inspiring. It",

          "The tour here does a good job of describing the events leading up to Teddy Roosevelt being inaugurated here versus back in Washington DC. It gives you a picture of what was happening in our country at that time and how Roosevelt was unexpectedly thrust into the presidency,",
          "I have to admit this was not at the top of my list of must sees in buffalo. But on a rainy day, it was one of the few available options. The interesting talk by the guide as well as the interactive and modern presentations provided a quick and efficient education. Be aware",

          "The best time to visit is Father's Day. You can take dad and he gets in free. I found the number of old cars to be a bit disappointing. What was there was neat, but maybe I expected too much? The Frank Lloyd Wright Filling Station was disappointing because you could not see",

          "This car museum is a nice collection of many different things, but Pierce-Arrow automobiles are not many of them. They do have a lot of nice vehicles here, but the Gilmore collection in Hickory Corner, Michigan has a larger collection in just a corner of one of it's many",

          "I have to admit, we only came here to see the Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW) filling station as it was the final FLW treasure we had left to see in Buffalo. I am not a car enthusiast, but I have to say the museum was very good and the cars and memorabilia were excellent. For FLW",
          "There are a lot of very old cars here that are sure to make everyone excited and they even have a few electric cars from the 1920s. Additionally, they have a lot of antique clothes and props from back in the day. One of their main attractions was the Frank Lloyd Wright Gas",
          "I have been wanting to stop in for a couple of years and finally got the chance this past Veterans Day and it was well worth it. I have always been a fan of the Pierce Arrow and they have a number of worthy models in this collection such as the 1919 Bus, 1912 Pierce motorcycle",

          "Great museum - Frank Lloyd Wright's gas station was what attracted us to visit, but the story of Pierce-Arrow, the memorabilia, company archival information and of course the cars were just as captivating. We never knew that a Playboy brand car, predating the magazine, existed",

          "My husband enjoyed seeing all the old cars at this facility. I enjoyed viewing a lot of the other artifacts on display. I would have liked to have seen more label copy. Still trying to picture what the Frank Lloyd Wright gas station would have looked like on a busy street",
          "We heard about this through some Frank Lloyd Wright fans...like ourselves. One of the highlights in this museum is a 30/40's gas station designed by FLW but never built. It has a lot of copper work in it and is topped off by the 1935 Auburn that belonged to FLW....an orange one.",
          "I'm a Frank Lloyd Wright fan, have enjoyed everything FLW in Buffalo (and elsewhere) and was SO looking forward to seeing the filling station he designed for Buffalo. Fresh from Darwin Martin House, Graycliff, having seen the other private residences in Buffalo, the Boathouse",

          "If you are a fan of classic cars, you don't want to miss the Pierce-Arrow Museum. The cars and memorabilia are a must-see but there is also the Frank Lloyd Wright filling station that is amazing. Take the tour to get the most out of your visit. More things keep being added as",

          "First time at the museum and didn't know what to expect. My favorite part was the Frank Lloyd Wright filling station display. I agree with one of the other reviewers that there should be some indication on when the tour to that room is. It is a closed room that you can only go",
          "If you are interested in antique cars, this is the place to see. Altho Pierce-Arrows are the main focus, there are many other types of cars. Don't miss the Frank Lloyd Wright designed gas station-it is a wonderful example of the early days of auto travel.",
          "My favorite car, so my review might be biased. Some lovely Pierce Arrows here, and a recently added bonus: a gas station (model) constructed from the 1927 renderings of Frank Lloyd Wright - due to a breakdown in negotiations between Wright and the client it was never built, but",
          "This place is really cool! Lots of Buffalo and WNY history under one roof. Everything from old hub caps and hood ornaments, to old electric cars and gas pumps. Definitely take the tour as the guide has a wealth of knowledge and is happy to share it. They host events there as",
          "This is my favorite attraction in Buffalo! Not only are there many amazing Pierce-Arrow cars that will take your breath away, but they build from the original plans the only filling station that Frank Lloyd Wright ever designed! Also, they have great toys from the period! I have",
          "$10 for adults and $5 for kids to enter. No food or drinks. A lot more than just Pierce Arrow cars to look at inside. If You like old cars, plan to spend 2-3 hours.",
          "When we drove to the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino we noticed this attraction because there were some beautiful cars in the parking lot. It has cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trucks, clothing from the era, old signs, etc. The biggest feature was the Frank Lloyd Wright's 1927",

          "This is a cute little museum, and as it continues to grow will keep getting better and better. We visited to \"fill time\" and it was a pleasant way to spend an hour or so. There are a fair number of old cars and other driving \"memorabilia\", however it would be nice if there was",
          "This was actually something my husband chose to do on a little getaway weekend. Old cars usually not my cup of tea, but this museum is more than a warehouse for old cars. There are indeed many cool cars, but also many fascinating exhibits all having something to do with",
          "We went on a rainy Sunday with some out of state company. I was suprised how many people were there. The museum is organized well, easy to see everything, even with crowds. If you are going for the Frank Lloyd Wright gas station, you will be disappointed. My 5 year old",

          "We had a group tour through the museum on June 28, 2015. It is an amazing display of not only automobiles, but memorabilia of all sorts related to the Pierce Arrow and more. The Frank Lloyd Wright service station is wonderful. The guide gave great details about the station.",
          "Wasn't sure if just visiting a old car museum was for me, but I am glad I did because there was some other interesting things in this museum. Not far from Coca cola field, we walked to it, about 1/2 mile from the metro rail, but it appeared to be plenty of available parking. A",
          "Besides a great variety of old cars and history about the Pierce Arrow, the building is full of period touring costumes and travel/automobile accessories. Loved the old picnic baskets outfitted with china and silver!",
          "The Pierce-Arrow is a really great museum. I could definitely spend more time than we did looking at the vehicles, displays and items for sale. There is a lot of history here and much to learn. And beautiful old cars. Also, we took the tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright designed",
          "The longer you walk around the main museum the more interesting bits you find; who knew the corvair engine had a military application!? The Frank Lloyd Wright fuel station is awesome, and it's display area is top notch It's too bad the design was never used at the time it was",
          "This museum has many cars and other forms of transportation, including the brand of car called the playboy. The car came before the magazine. There is also a Frank Lloyd Wright designed gas station built inside the museum. Very enjoyable stop.",
          "If you're coming here to see the Frank Lloyd Wright gas station, you'll probably be disappointed if you expect it to live up to other architectural attractions, especially Wright designs built during his lifetime. It's a poorly-executed building further hampered by the space",
          "I came here for only one reason - to see the Frank Lloyd Wright designed gas station that has been built and is housed in part of the museum. While waiting for the tour guide to take us into the new, larger exhibition space, I wandered among a treasure trove of old cars and old",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Saint Joseph Cathedral, is located at 50 Franklin Street, in downtown Buffalo, New York and is currently the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuffalo's first bishop, John Timon, established St. Joseph's in 1847 to be the seat of the new diocese.  Because of the economic situation in the city he raised funds to build the church while he was in Europe.  The cornerstone was laid on February 6, 1851.  During construction, a storm approached the city from Lake Erie and destroyed several homes in the area.  Bishop Timon allowed the residents to set up tents within the cathedral's walls for several weeks.  The cathedral was usable, but not complete, when it was dedicated on July 1, 1855.  The south tower was completed in the summer of 1862.  Bishop Timon consecrated the completed cathedral on August 21, 1863.\nIn 1902, Bishop James Quigley decided that the diocese required a new cathedral and purchased property at Delaware Avenue and Utica Street beginning in 1902.  Italian architect Aristide Leonori designed a new Gothic Revival cathedral which was constructed between 1912 and 1915.  The new edifice became known as St. Joseph's (New) Cathedral and this church became known as St. Joseph's Old Cathedral.  This time both towers of the new cathedral were completed to a height of 260 feet (79 m). Unfortunately, the cathedral was better suited for Rome's climate rather than Buffalo's. By 1924, the north and south transepts required major repairs and by 1927, the towers were so unstable they were removed.  The exterior marble started to separate from the brick and Bishop Edward D. Head determined in 1976 that repairs would be too costly for the \"new\" St. Joseph's and the diocese.  In 1977, after the demolition of the new cathedral, the \"old cathedral\" once again became known as St. Joseph's Cathedral.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nBishop Timon selected New York architect Patrick C. Keely, who had worked with A. W. N. Pugin, to design the church.  He created a Gothic Revival structure 120 feet (37 m) in length by 73 feet (22 m) across.  The original plan called for towers on the north and south corners of the facade, however only the south tower was finished. The tower contained a 43-bell carillon by Bollee & Son of Le Mans, France. At the time of its completion in 1869, the carillon was the largest in the U.S. and the third largest in the world. Installed in St. Joseph's in 1870, the bells were too large for the cathedral's tower and never worked properly. At present, all but 2 of the bells have been removed from the church tower.\nBishop Stephen V. Ryan added the Lady Chapel built at the rear of the cathedral in 1873.\nThe three lancet windows above the altar were produced at the direction of King Ludwig II of Bavaria for the Paris Exposition of 1855.  During his trips to Europe, Bishop Timon saw the windows and asked if the King would donate them to the new structure.  After first being refused, the Bishop persisted and the Ludwig relented.The cathedral was renovated in 1882, 1903\u201305, 1937\u201347 and most recently in 1977.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe choir loft houses a 3,627 pipe Hook & Hastings organ, Opus 828. The organ was built in 1876 for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, where it was played frequently for concerts. It was moved to the Cathedral following the end of the Exposition February 13, 1877.  The organ was updated in 1925 and 1976, but by 1996 had become unplayable.  In 1998, the bishop and parish council engaged the Andover Organ Company to restore and expand the instrument.  Andover installed the restored instrument in 2001 as its Opus R-328.  It currently contains three manuals and 90 stops.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Catholic cathedrals in the United States\nList of cathedrals in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Cathedral Site\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo Official Site",

          "One of the oldest and most beautiful Roman Catholic Cathedral in the heart of the city of Buffalo. built in 1862. Mass is still held there. The view of the inside is awesome. A must see to appreciate. we enjoyed",
          "Attended this program Mon., Dec. 21, it was combination of the Cathedral Chior and the Nichols Upper School chorus, the music was w onderful, readings related to Christmas",
          "I have seen so many religious building but this one is by far in the top ten for beautiful. Unfortunately there was a wedding going on while I was there, so my pictures were limited on the inside but wow is it worth the few minutes to see it.",
          "St Josephs is a beautiful historic cathedral. Spires and stained glass windows galore. Definitely worth astroll around and through.",
          "This is a beautiful old church that is over 150 years old. From to outsde, it seems to have some beautiful old stained glass windows. I remember back when churches were open but they all seem to be locked up tight except when there is a service. Too bad! I would think that",
          "Very big church, beautiful stained glass windows, awe inspiring marble sanctuary. Just gorgeous. Lovely to visit.",
          "You won't need tons of time to quickly view this cathedral. Wonderful to experience and if you wish to stay and worship or pray, allow for a bit more time. Parking in area but it can be tight!",

          "You have to see this beautiful Cathedral to experience the peace and tranquility of the space. If you would like you can just stop in a say a few prayers, light a candle or attend a mass. If you are in the area, see the new sculpture of the homeless Jesus outside. A must see if",

          "One of my favorite places in Buffalo. I use to sing in their children's choir, so I have seen both the public and back spaces of the church and they are all beautiful. The architecture in and of itself is amazing, but the people there are wonderful as well.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful cathedrals in Buffalo. Visit during the day when you can fully appreciate the gorgeous stained glass windows. A gem right in the middle of downtown Buffalo.",
          "Exceptionally beautiful. We ran into the parochial vicar, and he was very friendly. As he pointed out, the light-colored walls really make the stained glass windows \"pop\" - not dark and gloomy as many churches tend to be. It's right downtown, so definitely take a moment to go in",
          "Definitely worth a visit, the sculptures, architecture, and stained glass windows were amazing. The museum downstairs showed works of an awesome man devoted to years of service. Right next to a old neat cemetery. Easy free parking and everything else was free too. Don't miss",

        "wiki": "The Tifft Nature Preserve is a 264-acre nature preserve in Buffalo, New York, and one of the largest municipal nature preserves in New York.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land that is now the Tifft Nature Preserve was originally part of extensive Native American hunting and gathering grounds. By the 1700s it had come under the control of the Haudenosaunee. \nThe land was first deeded in 1845. George Washington Tifft purchased 600 acres in 1858, transforming it into a large dairy farm. The Tifft family held onto the land until 1883. By 1900 the site had become a trans-shipment center, primarily for coal and iron ore. It had twelve shipping lanes and docked 83 vessels. This ended with the 1912 Panama Canal Act, which forced the separation of all rail and shipping interests. During the 1950s and 1960s, the site had become an unofficial dump. The land was purchased in the 1970s by the City of Buffalo for use as a landfill. In 1973, 2,000,000 cubic yards of refuse was transferred from Squaw Island and spread across the Tifft lands.Following public outcry, a city-supported not-for-profit organization was organized in 1976. A visitor center was completed in 1978. The not-for-profit was merged with the Buffalo Museum of Science in 1982. The preserve was temporarily closed in 1983 for removal of hazardous waste by the NYS DEC. \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe preserve consists of 264-acres of restored habitat including a cattail marsh. It is as an important northeastern stopover for migratory raptor and waterfowl species. The preserve was designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society in 1998.\nPublic access is provided by five miles of nature trails and three boardwalks with viewing blinds in and adjacent to the cattail marsh. \nPopular outdoor recreation activities includes birdwatching, hiking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. The Herb and Jane Darling Education Center provides educational displays, restrooms and indoor programming and event space. As of 2019, the parking lot and trails were open year-round during daylight hours.\nThe preserve is supported by the not-for-profit Friends of Tifft Preserve. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Forest Lawn Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery in Buffalo, New York founded in 1849 by Charles E. Clarke.  It covers over 269 acres (1.1 km2) and over 152,000 are buried there, including U.S. President Millard Fillmore, First Lady Abigail Fillmore, singer Rick James, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, and inventor Lawrence Dale Bell. Forest Lawn is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSince its inception, Forest Lawn has served as a cemetery, park, arboretum, crematory and outdoor museum. Monuments, mausoleums and sculptures have attracted visitors for over 150 years. The first sculpture of Seneca Indian chief Red Jacket was erected in 1851. Red Jacket is depicted wearing the richly embroidered scarlet coat presented to him by a British officer, while on his breast is displayed the large silver peace medal awarded to him by President George Washington.\n\nEvery summer Forest Lawn offers \"Sundays in the Cemetery\" tours, each with a particular theme. Past examples have included the Pan-American Exposition Trolley Tour, Forest Lawn History Trolley Tour, Forest Lawn History Walk, Civil War Bus Tour and the Forest Lawn Nature Walk.\n\n\n=== Margaret L. Wendt Archive and Research Center ===\nIn 2014, the 3,140-square-foot (292 m2) Margaret L. Wendt Archive and Resource Center opened within the cemetery.  It is a digitized history center, of interment records maintained since 1849, that features a number of interpretive displays highlighting the notable citizens buried in the cemetery. The building features climate controlled rooms and the design of the building mimics some of the historic structure that once stood at the same site. The staff includes Sandy Starks (Interpretive Program Director),  John Edens and  Lydia Ortiz. Construction and funding for the Center was provided by The Margaret L. Wendt Foundation along with support from The John R. Oishei Foundation.\n\n\n=== Mausoleums ===\nIn 2004, Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s 1928 design for the Blue Sky Mausoleum was realized. The Mausoleum contains 24 crypts, which can be purchased and memorialized by individual owners. The Blue Sky Mausoleum is one of three Frank Lloyd Wright memorial sculptures in the world.  Sculptor David P. Dowler created a Steuben Glass piece in a limited edition of 26, of which 24 are reserved for those who purchase crypts in the Mausoleum.  Crypt clients also receive a copy of architectural historian Richard O. Reisem's 2005 book, Blue Sky Mausoleum of Frank Lloyd Wright.\nOther mausoleums in the cemetery include:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Others buried here ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nForest Lawn Cemetery official site",

          "It is a beautiful, serene cemetery and you can spend hours enjoying the solitude and the incredible monuments. The pond has benches so you can relax and watch the ducks.",
          "I'm from Buffalo, but I love to spend a day walking through this cemetery. Not only is it gorgeous, but it also boasts some very famous \"residents\" including Millard Fillmore and Samuel Wilkerson, father of the Buffalo harbor. Walk through, feed the ducks... It's especially",
          "We visited here just briefly as part of a Frank Lloyd Wright day long coach tour offered by Buffalo Tours. The Blue Sky Mausoleum was interesting to see and hear about (how expensive this place is is really quite astounding). It is a sleek, minimalist design. The bus driver",

          "A very beautiful cemetary. We visited the memorial area designed bu Frank Loyd Wright which was worth the visit. A tour of this large and beautiful cemetary would be most interesting on a cooler day.",
          "One might think a tour through a cemetary is ridiculous...until you tour through Forest lawn. They have guided tours and self guided tours...or just walk through and enjoy the beauty. There a several \"famous\" people buried here. I most enjoy looking at the old head stones,",

          "Forest Lawn is just so interesting, a very unique place. You wouldn't think that you would want to tour a cemetary, but it's completely worth it. There are well known people buried here, a beautiful landscapre, and some serious history.",
          "Go on a tour. The guides are outstanding and really bring the place alive (and that's good, considering it is a cemetery and all).",
          "I have attended numerous tours and programs at the cemetery and have always enjoyed myself. I like the tours when the actors come on the bus dressed as people buried at the cemetery and give that persons life story. The winter programming at the chapel, especially the Christmas",
          "This cemetary is more than I expected!! Usually when someone says \"let's go to the cemetary\" they have a specific grave to visit....not so this time. The landscaping is incredible and the property is huge. The place was so large that wildlife roamed the grounds and weren't",
          "this place is a true attraction like any magnificent one in a national capital. The mausoleum garden alone is worth the trip. Its just breathtaking and very beautiful and unique. Take the trolley trip and a camera.",

          "I'll admit, I was a little freaked out to drive through a cemetery for \"enjoyment\", but it really is beautiful and worth checking out.",
          "So you think you are going to go to a cemetery...NO. You will be embraced by nature, beautiful landscaping, the most amazing stones/ statues, walkways, bridges. You could spend a few hours here easily.",

          "Well, we were there for an event that involved the cemetary. It is beautiful there.",
          "I took the guided walking tour and it was excellent. I learned so much Bufalo history. In addition, there were costumed people who pretended they were some of the dead people. Great fun and well done!!",
          "This is a beautiful, well cared for cemetery. I used to love to go for walks there in the summer. It has an impressive layout with a lake, ponds, fountains, a babbling brook and ducks and geese. On my last visit I stood not 10 feet away from a doe and a buck who were perusing",

          "Spend an afternoon walking around the cemetery. There are guided tours (reservations recommended) or just come and hang out. Plenty of historic charactors buried here along with regular folks. Some of the monuments are massive and ornate. The place to be buried if you are",
          "Worth it for a long afternoon walk or even a shorter drive around the property. Lots to see.",
          "Great place to walk around. They also have tours. Some of the graves / mosuleums are very beautiful. In my opinion this beats other cemeteries that I have visited in Paris, France, and Savannah Georgia.",
          "The entire cemetery is beautiful. You may want to map out the plots of the graves you want to see beforehand, as this is a HUGE cemetery!",
          "Easy access, no charge and many historical grave sites. Very well taken care of and the beauty is unmatched in the area. So peaceful and serene.",
          "You really need to spend a few hours here. It is a beautifully landscaped cemetery with many famous people. The monuments are amazing and it is an enjoyable afternoon walking and or driving around on a self guided tour. There are many sites of historic interest. It sounds crazy,",

          "Give yourself that much needed visual rest by visiting Buffalo's historic Forest Lawn Cemetary. The grounds are well kept. Make sure to stop at the beautiful meditation Lake and feed the ducks !",
          "Pick up a map at the office. Many of the older mausoleums are strikingly detailed. Don't miss the recently built Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Blue Sky mausoleum.",
          "Strange but true: Forest Lawn is a great place to spend some time rambling around and exploring. You'll run across the graves of many famous (Rick James), historical (Chief Red Jacket, President Millard Fillmore) or otherwise noteworthy figures in this pretty spot, as well as",
          "One of the best maintained cemeteries I have visited in a long time. There are many roads in which to get lost on, but while you are lost you will get to view many beautiful architectural designs and unique tombstones. The cemetery isn't that old, but it has great history there,"

          "The elevator takes you to the 25 floor. The other three flights are by stairs but not too bad. We had a tremendous view of the city. There are pictures with buildings numbered and description of the buildings. We saw the hotel towers on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.",

          "This is just one of the amazing buildings to see in Buffalo. It is the best example of Art Deco in the area. With free tours available it's a must see for a visit to the city. Unfortunately it is infested with politicians so just watch out.",

          "I don't know if a tour of this place exists, but I never understood what all the fuss was about with this building. The architecture is fine, but the surrounding area is poor. THe inside of the building is nice enough. I guess if you have nothing else to do, and it's a cold day,",

          "This once-grand building could use a lot of TLC in my opinion. You need to go through the usual security checks to enter. The whole place is a worn and grimy (especially the elevators), and not very tourist friendly. That is a shame. Do take the elevators to the 25th floor",
          "Buffalo City Hall is a wonderful ancient building. It's full of class and elegants. It has that ancient look. It's where our Mayor of the City works and hundreds of other offices that's open for the public",

          "This incredible building is a show-off of Buffalo's wealth in the early Twentieth Century. Everything about this remarkable building is a treat for the eye - from the friezes on the outside to the murals in the lobby to the top floor observation deck with the absolute best",
          "There is an observation deck on the top floor that is the big attraction. It gives 360 degree views of the city and Niagara Falls on a clear day (sort of). Otherwise, it is city hall. An old building that needs some work and is the home of the city government. Not much going on",
          "This art deco building is gorgeous on the inside and out. It's free to go to the top and get a view of the city. Buffalo is rich in history and has had some struggles in the past, but the city is working to rebuild. Definitely worth the trip.",

          "My friend and I drove to Buffalo for the free tour given here daily. Unfortunately, the tour was cancelled due to BUFFALO TOURS not having a guide available. We did go up to the observation deck (MARVELOUS) and look around the lobby (MAGNIFICENT). I definitely want to go on",
          "This building is spectacular. I felt so small standing next to it. A must see in historic Buffalo. The downtown area has undergone a renaissance as of late and is an awesome place to see turn-of-the-century architecture.",

          "It was not a planned visit to the Buffalo city hall, but..WoW!!. Old building, ArtDeco style that is really worth seeing. I went in to take care of some business and ended up sticking around to look around the building. I was shocked so see how impressive the decor is.",

          "This was one of our \"must-sees\" as The Goo Goo Dolls performed in front of it for their rainy concert on July 4, 2004. Even without the connection to The Goo Goo Dolls this is worth a trip. The building is quite impressive with 32 stories. There is an amazing skylight to peek",
          "This Art Deco building is interesting enough around the outside architecture and also on the inside. Prepare for screening of your bags and walk through magnetometer. Take the right bank of elevators to the top (25th floor), then walk another 3 flights up to the rooftop viewing",
          "It was our first time visiting the Buffalo City Hall during our nephew's Spring break. The minute you enter the building, the magnificent architecture blows your mind. I started gasping at the ceiling right after I entered and never stopped. We were unfortunate to have just",
          "this is definitely worth a visit; it's really amazing if you can remember Buffalo in it's heyday. Our tour guide Harry had lots of stories and explained much of the symbolism in the murals and decorative features. The observation deck is not to be missed. It was windy, but you",

          "You can go to the observation site when the building is open. The tours are Noon, or 1pm. Got a really good feel for the life of Buffalo, seeing the beautiful ceiling in the council chambers, and the observation deck was terrific. Great for taking pictures on a bright clear day.",
          "So much to see here it's hard to take it all in in one visit. The highlight is the view from the platform near the top, which gives a unique view to the city's planned layout. Fantastic art and design in the lobby. Must-see in Buffalo.",

          "I was really excited to visit the City Hall to check out what everyone loves about it. I checked the reviews and the website. We weren't able to make the tour at noon but went up at 4:15 to see for ourselves since the building closes at 5. When we arrived we were told that",
          "Buffalo is a great city to visit if you're interested in architecture. The City Hall is among the best... a beautiful Art Deco building from the 1930s, the same time as the great skyscrapers of New York City. And the style is similar. But this building is equal to the Chrysler",
          "This a great city for architecture fans. We missed out on tour since we were there on a weekend. Several gems in the vicinity including a super Luis Sullivan high rise make this great city for a visit. Plus one can see the land of the sane across the water..",
          "We swung by city hall to pick up some birth certificates on a recent trip to Buffalo. While we were there, we decided to head up to the observation deck at the top. The views of the city were fantastic. I loved being able to look out over the lake and the canal. The inside of",

          "Parked in the ramp next door, so it was technically a $2 activity. Just walk into the front doors, go through security and if you want you can get instructions from the info desk. Otherwise take the elevators to 25 and then walk about three flights to the observation deck area.",
          "Its wasn't the best way to go through the steps getting to the 20th floor was the first time in a long time I've been working up a sweat with friends",
          "First, this is a beautiful building - in fact, Buffalo is chock full of stunning buildings designed by some of the foremost architects of the day. Second, the views are unparalleled...better than even being at the waterfront (for me). The observatory area has both an indoors",

          "There was a publicly led tour when we visited (Monday at noon), which is a regular feature (but I'm not sure if it's available all weekdays or not). The only downside was the full search of our daypacks by police and metal detector entry to get into the building, but I guess",

      "name": "Guaranty Building",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Guaranty Building, formerly called the Prudential Building, is an early skyscraper in Buffalo, New York. Designed by Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, it was completed in 1896. The building has been declared a National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Building context ==\n\nThe building was the brainchild of a Buffalonian businessman and entrepreneur Hascal T. Taylor. He planned to construct a speculative office building called \"The Taylor Building\" in the developing downtown district. The site Taylor chose was strategically located adjacent to the then County and City Municipal building and near a number of institutional structures. The intention was to attract high quality tenants such as lawyers through proximity, desirable amenities, and the captivating design of an avant garde architect like Sullivan. The Guaranty Construction Company was contracted to build it. The untimely demise of Mr. Taylor as the project was reaching its apogee resulted in the Guaranty's decision to take on the project alone.\nThe Guaranty Building was not alone among major private building projects in Buffalo at the time. Two blocks away, the Ellicott Square Building was being built to be the largest retail building in the world. This structure, extant today, exhibits an alternate exploration in the possibilities of new commercial urban architecture by Charles B. Atwood and Daniel Burnham.\nAs Buffalo's downtown rose above Lake Erie, further feats of engineering were securing the future of the city and the built environment. Although earlier attempts had harnessed the power of nearby Niagara Falls, it was just after the Guaranty building was constructed in 1896 that the power was sent to Buffalo, illuminating the city with hydroelectricity.\nBuffalo's rise to prominence in the built environment was matched in the political.  As the Guaranty building was being drafted, Grover Cleveland was re-elected 22nd president of the United States. A former Erie County Sheriff, Cleveland had risen meteorically to mayor of Buffalo, governor of New York and then the presidency within five years. His platform of reform against entrenched political machines, bossism, and patronage was desperately needed, especially in major urban centers such as New York and Chicago. Cleveland's fiscal policies had resulted in his loss of the presidency in 1888, but the results of Benjamin Harrison's interim term brought him back to the office in 1892. Curiously the panic of 1893 which ultimately destroyed the firm of Adler & Sullivan had destroyed Cleveland's first presidential term, but also resulted in Cleveland's return to office and the final commission of Adler & Sullivan in Buffalo.\n\n\n== Plan ==\n\nSullivan's design for the building was based on his belief that \"form follows function\".  He and Adler divided the building into four zones.  The basement was the mechanical and utility area; since this level was below ground, it did not show on the face of the building.  The next zone was the ground-floor zone which was the public areas for street-facing shops, public entrances and lobbies.  The third zone was the office floors with identical office cells clustered around the central  elevator shafts.  The final zone was the terminating zone, consisting of elevator equipment, utilities and a few offices.The supporting steel structure of the building was embellished with terra cotta blocks.  Different styles of block delineated the three visible zones of the building. Writing in his Kindergarten Chats, Sullivan said that a tall building \"must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line.\"While the exterior skin of the Guaranty expresses a new form for the steel skyscraper, its plan indicates those hard realities of function necessary to construct such a building and to sell it. The building is essentially a U-shaped plan stacked upon a rectangular solid. The interstitial spaces between wings of the \"U\" create opportunities to introduce skylights to the lobby below, and to cover the ceilings with stained glass.  The plan contained a single vertical circulation core with four elevators, a mail slot, and staircase. No fire-stair was provided or necessary. The internal portion of the \"U\" faces south so as to collect light for the interior recesses of the building- light being a necessary commodity to attract good tenants. Sullivan spared nothing to accomplish this end for: \"In order to increase the amount of light to the interior, the stairwell and the light slit facing the inner courtyard were lined with white glazed terra-cotta that was more costly than normal tiles.\"The first and second floors are united both spatially and visually through additional staircases and the intention of retail occupation. Mechanical systems were relegated to the basement, including the motors for the elevators, boilers, and electrical \"dynamos.\" Entrances were provided on both Church and Pearl Streets. A concierge desk offered services to tenants and guests including mail delivery. \nAbove the \"base\" of the building a series of office floors of identical plan were placed.  These floors featured private lavatories in reconfigurable office spaces. The halls were defined by wood and glass partition walls, intended to give the interior a bright and \"club\" like feeling. The elevators and staircases were enclosed not by walls, but metal cages permitting southern light to penetrate through the circulatory systems and into the hallways.\nThe only exception to the rise of offices was the seventh floor with lavatories and a barbershop, and the top floor with a US Weather Service Bureau office and spaces for building attendants.\n\n\n== Ornamentation ==\n\nThe most remarkable problem for those wishing to cast Sullivan exclusively in the camp of proto-modernist designers is his steadfast and adroit insistence to ornament his buildings.  Ornament is one of the most defining characteristics of the Guaranty as \"The entire fa\u00e7ade of this building is clothed in ornament, like hieroglyphs on the columns and walls of temples in ancient Egypt.\" \nSullivan's ornament is unmistakably original, but it is not without precedents in the contemporary tradition of the English Arts and Crafts movement.  \"The numerous parallels between Sullivan's ornament and the architectural decoration of Furness make it clear that Sullivan's ornament came directly from Furness and, through him, from earlier ornament by English architects.\" The context of his ornament is important as it was seen as a salient amenity for the attraction of tenants to his buildings. For all the \"good taste\" his ornament might project to the tenant of the 19th century, it situated his design within an anti-classicist categorization out of \"good taste\" in the 20th century. This change was precipitated by the World's Columbian Exposition where Sullivan was the only American to win a European design medal and the only American to offer non-classically inspired design. \nThe Guaranty, for all its evocative general expression of tectonics is equally as evocative at the scale of its modular terracotta components. \"Here the balance of interest between the individuals and the group to which they belong is precarious, and the sheer number of compositional elements makes it difficult to attend to the individually.\" It is difficult to determine whether the ornament serves to reinforce the building or the building reinforces the ornament. The experiential effect of so much pattern and repetitive design is homogeneity in tension with the expression of individual components. Unlike the Wainwright building, where ornament is more directly patterned on historical forms and where spandrels are self differentiated, the Guaranty is almost brutal in the hierarchical treatment of and expression within its terracotta relief. Such conforming treatment is at odds with the supposedly democratic naturalism Sullivan claims for the design.\nEspecially near the base, ornamental patterns reflect the span and connection of underlying steel members. As the components rise, a rigid pattern is followed, story upon story until the cornice where the pattern explodes into an umbrageous tangle of leaves and vines, encapsulating the windows and reaching outward over the street below. The ornament tells the same story as the theory which created it: bottom, middle, top- light steel skeleton within.\nThe modulating ornament of the Guaranty also indicates the evolution of the medium for Sullivan as an artist. His initial explorations were inspired directly by contemporary work and historical precedent. Eventually his contact with Adler and work involving the \"engineers aesthetic\" led to more structurally expressive forms, and eventually to an art only his own, florid and organic. \"From 1885 through 1889 Sullivan's ornament lost much of its former angularity and became more sophisticated and luxuriant.\"\nIt is perhaps due to Sullivan's experiences at the Ecole des Beaux Arts that his ornaments as well as his building are given so much expressive and didactic energy. \"His evident haste in wanting to set down the architectural vision before it became blurred even in the slightest degree presumably derives from the method at the French school of working from, and staying as close as possible to, the esquisse.\" This is an idea he apparently held for designing ornamental elements as well.  His sketch for a column capital at the Guaranty labeled \"finis\" indicates the level of development with which his draftsmen began work. While containing some specific information, the sketch indicates more a painterly composition than a design document.\nCuriously, the process of design used by Sullivan to create such innovation was precisely that which prevented him from evolving his conception of plan and section to something his \"modern\" successors would explore. \"In embracing the French theories of plan and esquisse, Sullivan remained firmly wedded to his time and place. . . By insisting upon the preeminence of plan, he could hardly have begun to imagine buildings with the spatial complexity of a Wright or a Le Corbusier.\"\n\n\n== Comparison with the Wainwright Building ==\nComparisons with the firm's first major success in tall buildings, the Wainwright are instructive insofar as the refinements of the Guaranty are more evident. \"Although this building [the Guaranty] is considered by critics to be the \"twin\" of the Wainwright Building, the elegance of the underlying steel-frame construction behind the red terra-cotta tiles is more apparent here than in the Wainwright.\" Unlike its predecessor, the entirety of street facades on the Guaranty are shrouded with the same material- red terracotta. Gone are the heavy corner piers of the Wainwright and in their place a constant rhythm of equal bays echoing the steel frame underneath. The two do share many traits: Simplicity of form, richness of detail. Red color not chaste white of renaissance typical buildings characterizes both buildings. The site for the Guaranty building is smaller than the Wainwright, yet called for an equivalent number of offices, resulting in an additional three stories. Both the Guaranty and the Wainwright occupy corner lots. \"The Wainwright may indeed represent the single episode of most aesthetic consequence in the shift from the tall office building in masonry to its skeletal predecessor; yet not only does the masonry tradition persist in the Wainwright, ornament also assumes a traditional, even if exceptionally conspicuous, role in its design.\" It is an explainable transition piece. The Guaranty Building is a radical departure however from the masonry prototype. Ornament and \"cladding\" cover the surface of the Guaranty's steel frame, a thin covering over a flexible skeleton.Critical reception of the Guaranty Building was quite strong upon its opening. The critic Barr Ferree in 1895 opined: \"though possibly the most richly decorated commercial building in America, the skill of the artist has produced a design of structural sobriety with great richness of effect.' This unity of structure and aesthetics 'has been attained' he diagnosed, 'by the long unbroken vertical lines of the superstructure.' Montgomery Schuyler knew of 'no steel-framed building in which the metallic construction is more palpably felt through the envelope of baked clay.'\"The Wainwright building may fairly be said to have revolutionized the emergent form of the skyscraper, with ramifications felt for the next hundred years. The Guaranty Building is a refinement and perfection of the form which the Wainwright found, and its transfiguration into a spirit of design.\n\n\n== Decline and restoration ==\nAs was true of many older office buildings, the Guaranty Building was \"modernized\" during the mid-20th century. Fluorescent lighting, wood paneling and a dropped ceiling were installed in the historic lobby. The exterior storefronts were sheathed in fiberglass. A fire occurred in 1974, and by that time the building was dilapidated and threatened with demolition. \nHerculean efforts were made to save the building, and the support of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was secured for its restoration. This restoration occurred in the early 1980s. It was undertaken by architects [[CannonDesign]. Funding came in part from the federal preservation tax credit program.In 2002, the building was purchased by law firm Hodgson Russ. In 2008, after a further rehabilitation, it became the firm's headquarters. \nThe building underwent a further series of restorations in the mid-to-late 2000s. The restoration, which totaled $15.6 million, was designed by Gensler Architects of Washington, D.C; M/E Engineering of Buffalo; and Flynn Battaglia Architects of Buffalo.\n\n\n== Landmark status ==\nThe building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Guaranty Building & Interpretive Center\" from the Buffalo Niagara Convention & Visitors Bureau website\n\"Guaranty / Prudential Building\" at \"Buffalo As An Architectural Museum\" website\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. NY-5487, \"Prudential Building, 28 Church Street, Buffalo, Erie County, NY\", 16 photos, 10 data pages",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Richardson Olmsted Campus in Buffalo, New York, United States was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The site was designed by the American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in concert with the famed landscape team of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the late 1800s, incorporating a system of enlightened treatment for people with mental illness developed by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride. Over the years, as mental health treatment changed and resources were diverted, the buildings and grounds began a slow deterioration. In 2006, the Richardson Center Corporation was formed to restore the buildings.\nToday, the Richardson Olmsted Campus is being converted, beginning with the now open Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center and 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry, both within the Towers Building and two flanking buildings (about one-third of the Campus). The Richardson Olmsted Campus will also house The Lipsey Architecture Center Buffalo. The remaining buildings have been stabilized pending future opportunities.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nThe large Medina red sandstone and brick hospital buildings were designed in 1870 in the Kirkbride Plan by architect Henry Hobson Richardson with grounds by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The campus consists of a central administrative tower and five pavilions or wards progressively set back on each side, for eleven buildings total, all connected by short curved two-story corridors. Patients were segregated by sex, males on the east side, females on the west.  The wards housed patients until the mid-1970s.  The central administration building was used for offices until 1994.The campus, the largest commission of Richardson's career, marks the advent of his characteristic Romanesque Revival style. When emulated by later architects, this style is referred to as Richardsonian Romanesque.  It has been the subject of a long-term preservation campaign.  Nevertheless, three pavilions on the east side were demolished in the 1970s to make way for newer psychiatric facilities.  In 1927, the northern farmlands were transferred back to the State for the development of what is today Buffalo State College.In 1973, the Asylum was added to the National Register of Historic Places and in 1986, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.  Patient records from 1881 to 1975 are in the collection of the New York State Archives in Albany, NY.  Architectural plans and drawings are in the H.H. Richardson Collection in the Houghton Library at Harvard University.\n\n\n=== Preservation efforts ===\n\nThe Preservation Coalition of Erie County (renamed \"Preservation Buffalo Niagara\" in October 2008) filed a lawsuit resulting in New York State establishing the Richardson Center Corporation in 2006 to rehabilitate the site and the State committing $100 million towards rehabilitation.  Both former New York State Assembly Member Sam Hoyt, and former Buffalo State College President Muriel A. Howard, were involved in plans for the restoration and reuse of the Richardson.Perimeter fencing and lighting were installed and a Peace Officer was hired to conduct regular patrols and prevent and deter further crime at the complex.  On March 5, 2008, stabilization began with the most severely damaged buildings, including the roof and down-spouts.  Stabilization was completed in 2012.On April 10, 2010, a fire occurred. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Damage was estimated at $200,000.In 2013, the South Lawn landscape on the property was completed.During the planning stages, the Richardson Center Corporation has used an active public process, aimed to help to inform the Master Plan during all phases of redevelopment for the Campus, including several public meetings.  A Community Advisory Group includes representatives from the adjacent neighborhoods, business districts, cultural institutions, Buffalo Psychiatric Center, SUNY Buffalo State, and historic preservation groups.\n\n\n=== Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center ===\nOn January 25, 2013, Phase I plans were announced to redevelop on third of the Campus into Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center, 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry and the Buffalo Architecture Center, both within the Towers Building and two flanking buildings.This first phase of redevelopment was completed in 2016. Hotel Henry and the 100 Acres opened in May 2017, and the architecture center will open thereafter.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 1983 a portion of a ground floor hallway and one hospital room were prepared to appear as a maternity ward and used as a location for The Natural, where the character Roy Hobbs, as played by Robert Redford, was shown recovering from internal injuries.Mount Massive Asylum, the main setting for the 2013 horror game Outlast, was modeled after the Richardson Olmsted Complex.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. NY-5606, \"State Lunatic Asylum, 400 Forest Avenue, Buffalo, Erie County, NY\", 8 photos, 8 data pages",

Some additional structures were originally part of Blackwell's Island Lunatic Asylum, which opened around 1863. The New York City Asylum for the Insane opened in 1863.The building was significantly enlarged in 1871, and a Kirkbride Plan style building was built.  After the immigration entry shifted to Ellis Island in 1892, the state took it over from Manhattan in 1899 and expanded it even further, renaming it the Manhattan State Hospital. At the time, it had 4,400 beds and was the largest psychiatric hospital in the world.At the time, it was one of two psychiatric hospitals for residents of Manhattan that had been taken over by the state. The other psychiatric hospital would become the Central Islip Psychiatric Center in Central Islip, New York. Both hospitals were referred to as \"Manhattan State Hospital\".\nIt later became the Manhattan Psychiatric Center. The current building complex was constructed in 1954. The facility is run and operated by the New York State Office of Mental Health.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe site is surrounded by Wards Island Park, which is administered by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.There is a Manned VTS Vessel Traffic Service Radar on one of the Original Hospital buildings: VTS Randalls Island, Manned VTS.\n\n\n== Notable patients ==\nLouis Pioggi, gangster\nMartin Hildebrandt, tattoo artist\nScott Joplin was hospitalized in late January 1917 for dementia caused by syphilis, and died there 2 months later on April 1, 1917.\nWilhelm Steinitz, the first undisputed world chess champion, was hospitalized with mental illness possibly caused by syphilis, and died there on August 12, 1900.\nMabel Boll, \"The Queen of Diamonds\" died of a stroke at the facility in April 1949 at the age of 54.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWards Island Park\nSocial Work in a State Psychiatric Center - A Bridge to Recovery",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Ralph Cookerly Wilson Jr. (October 17, 1918 \u2013 March 25, 2014) was an American businessman and sports executive. He was best known as the founder and owner of the Buffalo Bills, a team in the National Football League (NFL). He was one of the founding owners of the American Football League (AFL), the league with which the NFL merged in 1970, and was the last of the original AFL owners to own his team. At the time of his death he was the oldest owner in the NFL, at age 95, and the third-longest tenured owner in NFL history (over 54 years, behind the 63 years George Halas owned the Chicago Bears and almost equal to the 55 years Art Rooney owned the Pittsburgh Steelers, although Rooney's ownership and team operations were interrupted in the 1940s due to some complicated dealings). He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWilson grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of salesman Ralph Wilson Sr. and his wife, Edith Cole.He graduated from the University of Virginia (where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity) and attended the University of Michigan Law School. He was a 1936 graduate of Detroit University School, now University Liggett School. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters. After the war ended, he took over his father's insurance business and invested in Michigan area mines and factories. He eventually purchased several manufacturing outlets, construction firms, television and radio stations, and founded Ralph Wilson Industries.A minority owner of the Detroit Lions, Wilson got wind of Lamar Hunt's plans for a new league, the American Football League, to challenge the NFL. He tried to put together a team in Miami, but was turned down. His next choice was Buffalo, where the AFL's first choice of owner, Pat McGroder, had declined to start a team. In September 1959, Wilson sent Hunt a telegram with the words, \"Count me in with Buffalo.\u201d He named his new team the Bills, after a previous team that had played in the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1949. On October 28, 1959 the Buffalo Bills officially became the seventh AFL team. Wilson made professional football a resounding success in a \"small market\", signing such stars as Cookie Gilchrist, Jack Kemp, and Tom Sestak and Hall of Famers Billy Shaw and O. J. Simpson.\nHe was a guiding force in AFL policies that ensured success, such as gate and television revenue sharing.  As one of only three AFL owners to be on relatively solid financial ground (along with Hunt and Bud Adams), Wilson lent the financially troubled Oakland Raiders $400,000 and was also willing to lend money to Billy Sullivan of the New England Patriots. Wilson helped keep those franchises afloat, likely saving the entire league from folding (the AFL was unique among professional football leagues in that not a single AFL franchise folded in its history). In November 1963, Wilson along with then Raiders general manager Al Davis lobbied successfully to have AFL games postponed the Sunday after President John F. Kennedy's assassination; NFL games were played as scheduled.Wilson was most concerned about his team's financial solvency and was largely indifferent to the Bills' on-field success; O. J. Simpson later noted of his contract negotiations with the Bills that when Simpson's agent told Wilson of Simpson's potential to make the team a championship contender, Wilson shot back \"What good would a championship do me? All that means is everybody wants a raise.\"In 1989, after league commissioner Pete Rozelle announced his retirement, Wilson was on the six-member committee who was tasked with nominating potential candidates for the open position. Wilson's nominee, his former quarterback Jack Kemp, declined to pursue the post, as he had already taken a position in the U.S. Cabinet. (The job ultimately went to league attorney Paul Tagliabue.)\nAfter the original naming rights deal on the Bills' current stadium expired in 1998, the facility's name was changed from Rich Stadium to Ralph Wilson Stadium; it would not receive its current name of New Era Field until 2016, after his death and the subsequent sale of the team. According to an article on msn.com, Wilson, described as \"stubborn\", turned down numerous naming rights deals for the stadium.Wilson was one of the league's most outspoken owners, even near the end of his life. Wilson voted against the Cleveland Browns' relocation to Baltimore in 1995. He publicly rebuked NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in an open letter in 1998 over league policy, which disallowed criticism of referees, after poor officiating had a direct impact on a Bills loss that season. He was one of two owners (the Cincinnati Bengals' Mike Brown being the other) to oppose the league's former (pre-2011) collective bargaining agreement. (Wilson and Brown were commended for their foresight when the agreement later led to the 2011 NFL Lockout.) He also negotiated a deal to have his team play home games in Toronto from 2008 until 2014.Wilson retired from the position of president in 2001, giving operational control to General Manager Tom Donahoe; Wilson retook control of the team's operations in 2006. Wilson again retired as team president, this time surrendering all control of the team's operations to Russ Brandon, on January 1, 2013. He continued to consult with Brandon on team and league operations up until his death.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilson maintained a permanent residence in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan with his wife, Mary McLean, whom he met in 1989. He had three daughters from his first marriage to Janet McGregor Wilson, two of whom became involved in team business: Linda Bogdan (1948\u20132009), Pro Football's first female scout, was the franchise's Corporate Vice President until her death. Another daughter, Christy Wilson Hofmann, served as a consultant in the area of merchandising. The third daughter, Edith \"Dee Dee\" Wilson Jr., was never involved with the franchise. The highest ranking relative in the organization was Mary Owen, Wilson's niece, who served as Vice President of Strategic Planning until the team was sold. Wilson and his first wife divorced in 1970 after 26 years of marriage and shortly after their youngest child turned 19.Beginning in the 1990s, Wilson maintained a small, but very valuable, art collection, including works by Claude Monet, Edouard Manet and Alfred Sisley; his collection was valued in the tens of millions of dollars.Wilson was a 1992 inductee of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. He was a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason.\n\n\n=== Declining health and death ===\nWilson broke his hip in a fall at his home in July 2011, causing him to miss the Bills' home opener for the first time in franchise history. The injury left him wheelchair-bound. He issued a statement saying that he was undergoing physical therapy and hoped to attend at least one game during the season. Wilson also stated that he was \"very surprised\" at the team's 41-7 victory over Kansas City in Week 1. He was hospitalized in August and early September 2012 with an unspecified infection and missed the entire 2012 season. In April 2013, Wilson was reported as \"doing really well,\" with a statement that he hoped to make the 2013 home opener.Wilson died at his home on March 25, 2014 of natural causes at the age of 95. His estate held the franchise in trust until its sale to Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula in September 2014. The proceeds from the sale were used to form an endowment for the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Foundation, which funds charitable causes in the Buffalo and Detroit areas, in accordance with Wilson's instructions for the money set forth prior to his death. The organization was overseen for a few months by his niece Mary Owen until its sale to the Pegulas was completed on October 8, 2014.\n\n\n== Pro Football Hall of Fame ==\nOn January 31, 2009, Wilson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame along with former Buffalo Bills defensive end Bruce Smith. The Hall of Fame game, played the day after the 2009 inductions, strayed from the usual AFC\u2013NFC format and instead was contested by two original American Football League teams: the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers).  This matchup was announced after Wilson was elected.  Like Wilson, Titans owner Bud Adams was the only owner his team has ever had, and the two were the only living members of the \"Foolish Club\", the founders of the original eight AFL teams.  Wilson and Adams are two of only four men who have owned a professional football franchise continuously for fifty years (George Halas, who owned the Chicago Bears from 1920 until his death in 1983, is the third, and William Clay Ford Sr., Wilson's neighbor, who owned the Detroit Lions from 1961 to 2014, is the fourth).\nThe Hall of Fame game on Sunday, August 9, was a kickoff to the 2009 season, which would have been the 50th season of play for the AFL, if the NFL had not merged with it. Wilson was officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, August 8, 2009 with ESPN icon Chris Berman acting as his \"presenter\".  Wilson was scheduled to receive his Hall of Fame ring in a halftime ceremony during the Bills game against the Cleveland Browns on October 11, 2009. However, Wilson cancelled the event at the last moment, without notifying the press or fans, and no explanation was given.  It was widely speculated that Wilson cancelled the event out of fear of being booed by Bills fans for the team's chronic poor performance on the field and a series of highly unpopular managerial decisions. He was eventually presented with the ring on November 1.Wilson donated US$2.5 million to the construction of a \"Pro Football Research and Preservation Center\" at the Hall of Fame; the facility was named in Wilson's honor on August 13, 2012.\n\n\n== Thoroughbred racing ==\nWilson was also involved for a number of years in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing both as a breeder and as an owner in France and the United States. He bred Santa Anita Derby winner Jim French, as well as two-year-old European superstar Arazi, winner of the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile and European Horse of the Year. Another horse, Outta Here, raced in the 2003 Kentucky Derby and finished in seventh place.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nThe Ralph C. Wilson Jr. School of Education, St. John Fisher College, Rochester, New York.\nThe Mary & Ralph Wilson Jr. Hospice Inpatient Unit of Hospice Buffalo is named after him.\nThe Wilson Building, Cheektowaga, New York.\nRalph C. Wilson Jr. Athletic Field at the NFL/Youth Education Town-Boys & Girls Club at the Dick & Sandy Dauch Campus in Detroit, Michigan.\nRalph C Wilson Jr. Foundation:\nTwo $100 million posthumous donations, in honor of Wilson's 100th birthday, to the park systems in Buffalo and Detroit respectively; the former is the largest philanthropic donation in Western New York history\n$6 million grant to the Explore & More Children's Museum in Canalside, Buffalo, which was renamed after Wilson.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American Football League players\nKCIT\nKICU-TV\nWEVV-TV\nWWTV\n\n\n== References ==",

          "If you have children under about 8 this is the place to go. My 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year olds enjoyed it immensely. Not a moment were they bored. We were there about two and a half hours which was as long as they could handle it however, there \u2026",

          "The activities are cool. There are workers all over the place walking around but nobody explains anything to you. It just felt really invasive to have them literally watching every move you make. When you are talking to your children and trying to get them under some control, they but in.",
          "My grandkids had a great time here, infact a blast. It cost $55.00 for 5 people. Kids cost the same amount as adults.",
          "Definitely a great place for kids to interact with things",
          "Very clean and well-staffed. My 2 and 6 year olds  both had a great time. Definitely worth the 10 bucks a pedson!",
          "Hands on fun!! Try the chairs in the lobby - guaranteed to make you giggle.",
          "Great for kids. Old school toys. Best way for the little one to learn and grow. Obscure spot in the building but other than that. Can't wait to take him again when he's a little older to enjoy it more. ",

          "The atmosphere is 4 stars, a fun place for kids to come on a rainy day and explore. However my lower rating comes from the fact that the staff practically pushed us out the door. I understand that they have lives and want to end their work \u2026",
          "Took our 3 yr old twin boys there over the Thanksgiving holiday - They loved it. Had to drag them out of the place when lunch time came around - that was after hours of exploration. It's great!",

          "Very nice place",
          "$40 of fun for kids and parents.",

          "First off finding parking is a pain. It's pricey. I would never pay the cost for a membership. Going once was good enough.  There is not much to do and the Museum of Science is a much better place at least for my kids and myself.",

          "Cute ideas and my daughter loved it but it was a little pricey for the size and the mess. We arrived minutes after it opened and many stations had missing pieces or were not functional and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. \u2026",
          "Had a blast with my daughters can't wait to go again",

          "Excellent place to take your children.",
          "Nice place, activities seem well maintained.  Would offer the advice of putting some kind of physical barrier for kids so they cant just run out the front door when there is not anyone at the desk.  Watched an 18 month old whose parents \u2026",

          "Much better than it used to be in East Aurora, between the Strong Play Museum and the ExpERIEnce play museum, this ranks somewhere in between or right on par with the latter.\n\nOf course, parking is a bit of an issue in the city. Also, the \u2026",
          "Disappointed. I thought it was going to be alot better then it is . The top floor was ok but kind of boring .The 3rd floor was overwhelming I wish it was more spaced and sectioned off. My toddler went down the stairs to the water area , \u2026",
          "It's a nice facility, definitely a few very cool activities. Not really meant for any child over the age of 8 so for my 9 and 11 yr old it was a bit of a bust.",
          "My kid likes it a lot but it only opens till 4pm everyday on the week days which means those in school cannot visit at all. We are discouraged to get a membership.",
          "I think it needs to grow a bit more but the activities were fun and entertaining",
          "This place was amazing i have a 3yo and an 8yo and they both were entertained for hours u can go threw real quick in like an hour or enjoy and soak eveything in takes lobger like 3 hours but even us adults enjoyed things n watching our kids have so much fun was a pleasure",

          "Awesome place,  reasonable prices,  tons of entertainment for my 3 year old :)",
          "Super cute place for younger children up to about 10, but holy moly, it's EXPENSIVE if you don't live in E Aurora! Pay more for the adults than the children, even though it's made for the children, making it a place that isn't quite family \u2026",
          "Lots of hands on things for the kids to do",
          "Great hands on stations for children",
          "Tons of fun!",

          "If you are interested in anything supernatural, you will want to check this place out. The museum and the artifacts in it are your average stuff you might find in a local history museum. The stories of the odd events and happenings here are what make this place worthy of a stop.",

        "wiki": "Kleinhans Music Hall is a concert venue located on Symphony Circle in Buffalo, New York. The hall \"is renowned for its acoustical excellence and graceful architecture.\" Kleinhans is currently the home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, a regular venue for the Buffalo Chamber Music Society, and is rented out for other performing groups and local events. The building was designed by father-and-son team Eliel Saarinen and Eero Saarinen, with help from local architects F. J. and W. A. Kidd, Stanley McCandless as lighting consultant, and Charles C. Potwin as acoustical adviser. Kleinhans has two performance spaces, as well as additional rooms for rehearsals or private events. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its architecture, 49 years after its completion.\n\n\n== Performance Spaces ==\nKleinhans Music Hall offers two spaces for performances: the main auditorium, and the Mary Seaton Room. The main auditorium of Kleinhans Music Hall offers seats 2,441 (it originally accommodated 2839 seats, but underwent renovations in 2015), and showcases the hall's parabolic ceiling and acoustically-informed design. The shape of the hall is such that audience members in the back rows of the balcony will have as clear and instantaneous of an auditory experience as the people in the front rows of the ground level. Charles C. Potwin employed a 1:1.3 ratio in the design of the auditorium to achieve the most ideal acoustic. While the design of the main auditorium is less conducive to reverberation, it aims to create a more intimate experience by drawing the audience in. The austere color palette and simple lines seen in the layout also serve to direct the audience to the music without distraction of ornate decoration.The Mary Seaton Room is the smaller of the two performance venues, seating up to 700 for a concert, and is well suited for chamber ensembles.\n\n\n== History ==\nKleinhans Music Hall was named by Edward L. Kleinhans in honor of his wife, Mary Seaton Kleinhans, and his mother, Mary Livingston Kleinhans. The Kleinhans family owned a successful men's clothing company in Buffalo at the turn of the 20th century. Upon their deaths, three months apart in 1934, they left their entire estate of around $1 million to the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo with the request that the funds go to the development of a music hall.\nUpon its completion in 1940, the cost of construction reached $1.5 million, and included funds from President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration in addition to the $1 million from the Kleinhans estate. Kleinhans Music Hall opened on October 19, 1940 with an inaugural concert by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra under Maestro Franco Autori.In 2015, the seats of the auditorium were updated, and storage rooms were converted into an archive room to serve as an educational feature of the building's philanthropic history and architectural significance.\n\n\n=== Notable events ===\nOn September 8, 1964, Robert F. Kennedy, who at the time was the Democratic candidate to become a United States Senator from New York, gave a speech at Kleinhans in front of a crowd of 6,000 people.On November 9, 1967, four months after the city was rocked by the Buffalo riot, Dr. Martin Luther King gave a speech at Kleinhans titled \"The Future of Integration.\" In this speech, he proclaimed, \"We are moving toward the day when we will judge a man by his character and ability instead of by the color of his skin.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKleinhans Music Hall - Venue Website\nInformation from the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at Buffalo",

          "We saw a Jazz Orchestra at this place and they had free Horderves beforehand and it was wonderful. Went with my 83 year old grandma my 31 year old cousin and myself (25) and all of us enjoyed it immensely. Parking was very easy to get which was especially important for my Gma.",

          "I go to Kleinhans to hear the BPO a lot. For a small city, Buffalo has a phenomenal philharmonic orchestra - full of talent and lead by world-renowned conductor Joann Falletta. As for Kleinhans, its simple yet beautiful wood design isn't overwhelming or breathtaking, but the",

          "Saw the BPO rocks with Spectrum.it was the symphony with a night of Motown. Niot a bad seat in the house.we were lower level t center stage. I would recommend the back if the lower level as it is in a slant and viewing us easy . You really can't go wrong. Restaurant lower level",
          "We saw Fiona Apple here. Nice sound in the Theatre. The Ushers were cranky though. The lines were not long and because the venue was small.",
          "I liked this venue. We saw a rock concert here. It was nice to have social spaces/bars to sit in and mingle with other fans. You cannot take drinks into seating area though.",
          "We have always loved concerts here. The acoustics are amazing, and we have never had a problem in the hall. That being said, parking is still too expensive in the Kleinhans lot and nearly nonexistent on the streets",

          "This is a very convenient and well kept concert venue. The parking is simple and quite reasonable. Of course the shining star is JoAnn Falletta who brings innovative programs and outstanding guest artists such as: Van Cliburn to the Buffalo Philharmonic. Her energetic conducting",
          "The theater has wonderful sound, but it is dated and worn.",
          "The Buffalo Philharmonic is a top notch orchestra and a variety of programs make this a great place for classical and other music lovers.",

        "wiki": "Canalside, formerly known as Canal Side and Erie Canal Harbor, is a master-planned neighborhood and festival marketplace within the inner harbor of Buffalo, New York. Envisioned as a recreation of the western terminus of the Erie Canal, Canalside is situated on the Buffalo River, where the area was historically home to the Seneca people.\nIn the early 20th century, the predominantly Italian area known as Dante Place and Canal Street was subjected to the forces of urban renewal, and the canals were filled in and dense neighborhoods were razed. The Buffalo Skyway, Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and Niagara Thruway took its place, with parking lots interspersed.\nWith the completion of Marine Midland Arena (now KeyBank Center) in 1996, the Memorial Auditorium stood vacant. Empire State Development Corporation created a master plan for an Erie Canal Harbor redevelopment project in 1999, which addressed developing parcels of land underneath the Buffalo Skyway. In 2004, a new plan was created, centered around the creation of historically-aligned canals and mixed-use development.\nSeveral delays and controversies surrounding the planning, redevelopment and construction of the district drew reaction from the public, notably the inclusion of a flagship Bass Pro Shops store in 2007 that was later scrapped. The Memorial Auditorium was demolished by July 2009, and the land it occupied was subdivided into the historically aligned parcels from the 19th century, now known as the North and South Aud Block. Since 2010, the district has seen an uptick in construction projects and touring concerts and events. Projects completed or underway in the vicinity include LECOM Harborcenter adjacent to Main Street and Explore & More Children's Museum on the South Aud Block.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally built in Buffalo, New York in 1825 as the \"portal to the west,\" the Erie Canal Harbor served as the terminus for the passage of goods and passengers from the East Coast across the Great Lakes for much of the 19th century.  More importantly for Buffalo, the commercial activity fueled by the harbor helped transform the city into a thriving metropolis. Buffalo's notorious Canal Street was a short distance from the canal terminus.\nThe area had been the site of the original Village of Buffalo, near a Seneca Indian village on Buffalo Creek. The city eventually expanded outward from the waterfront location.\nThe Canal, completed in 1825, opened up the western United States to travelers and trade from the east coast.  With it came a tremendous increase in Great Lakes freighter traffic at Buffalo harbor, and with that an influx of canal and freighter crewmen who were often paid off in Buffalo and spent freely in the bars and brothels that sprang up in the district, known variously as \"Canal Street\", \"Five Points\" \"the Flats\" and \"the Hooks\". There were 93 saloons, 15 concert-hall dives, and hundreds of dance-hall girls. The song \"Buffalo Gals\" was written by John Hodges in 1844 and refers to the women who lived in the canal district.In the early 20th century, after the Erie Canal was deepened and shortened in 1895 and as the canal traffic moved to the railroads the district became the home of Italian immigrants, mostly Sicilian. Canal Street's name was changed to Dante Place and the neighborhood became known as Dante Place or \"Little Italy.\" Most of the bars and brothels gave way to three- and four-story brick tenements, each housing multiple families.By the late 1920s, the Canal had been filled in by New York State who saw the stagnant and polluted canal waters as a public health risk.Throughout its existence, the neighborhood suffered numerous fires, explosions, and other disasters. The most notable occurred on January 1, 1936 very early in the morning. Joseph Lopresti at 40 LeCouteulx just across the street from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church came home from Mass, lit a candle, and went into his tenement basement to get some wine. He was outside accessing the basement doors when the building exploded. This brought national attention to slum areas and new legislation was passed by New York State that allowed cities the right to condemn and demolish \"unsafe and unsanitary\" buildings. That began the urban renewal process leading to the beginning of the demolition of the tenements of Dante Place and by 1937, over 160 buildings had been demolished. By 1948, only 90 families remained in the area.\n\nIn 1938 there were plans to build new housing in the area dubbed \"Fairhaven Village\" which called for accommodations for 962 families with a total of 2,942 rooms at $17.50 a room including utilities with a 500 car underground garage. The effects of the Great Depression and World War II limited the construction funds needed to make the project a reality. Around the same time, Buffalo city officials used Works Progress Administration funds to build the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium on the former northeastern portion of the neighborhood. The last remnants of the former Canal Street/Dante Place neighborhood were demolished in 1950. The \"Fairhaven Village\" project was revived as the Dante Place Projects. Now known as the Marine Drive Apartments, they were completed in 1952. The New York State Thruway and the Skyway was later built in 1955.The Commercial Slip was a remnant of Little Buffalo Creek, which flowed into the Buffalo River just before the larger stream entered Lake Erie. The Commercial Slip formed one boundary of Buffalo's infamous Canal District, and was filled in when the district was marked for urban renewal in the 1950s. By that time, the New York State Thruway and the Skyway and Buffalo Memorial Auditorium had been built over the Canal district, and the Commercial Slip was buried and forgotten.\n\n\n== Reconstruction and redevelopment ==\n\nIn the late 1990s, public authorities began showing an interest in reviving Buffalo's Erie Canal heritage.  Initially, plans called for re-creating some buried elements of the Canal. However a public outcry, with pressure from citizens' groups and the local media, convinced the planners to excavate and restore actual portions of the district, including the Commercial Slip.In 2005, $279 million over 50 years was made available for the project via a re-licensing deal with the New York Power Authority that re-licensed the Niagara Power Project. The deal also established the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation to manage the funds and projects on the waterfront.\nThe Erie Canal Redevelopment project unearthed building foundations from the Canal-era neighborhood and restored the Commercial Slip, which formed the original natural outlet of Little Buffalo Creek into the Buffalo River.\n\nCompleted in 2008, Phase 2 of inner harbor plan laid out by the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation consisted of a re-watered navigable Commercial Slip in alignment with the original Commercial Slip, towpath/walkway on the west and east sides of the Commercial Slip, construction of a bowstring truss bridge, reconstructed Commercial Street, Steamboat Hotel and Lloyd Street ruins uncovered and preserved as an archeological site with a combination hard and grass surface, and the site of the former Union Block as an interpreted site with a grassy, sloped lawn.\nFrom 2008 to 2009, the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium was demolished, as it was an ailing structure. Initially, plans were in place to construct a  Bass Pro store on the location. The plans eventually were scrapped as Bass Pro decided against the location.As the culmination of nearly a decade's worth of effort, the first phase of the historic canal harbor area redevelopment opened to the public in 2008. It included the recreation of several distinctive features of the original Canal district, such as the Commercial Slip, which served as the historic juncture between the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes; the wooden-plank Central Wharf, which stretched from the foot of Main Street to the Commercial Slip; the award-winning Whipple Truss foot bridge, which accurately resembles traditional canal spans and connects the Central Wharf to the cobblestone Commercial Street; prominent canal-era buildings, which house various naval and military artifacts; as well as the excavation site of the original Steamship Hotel building foundations, which are presented alongside several interpretive exhibits showcasing the historical significance of the Erie Canal.\n\n\n=== Canal construction ===\n\nThe Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation planned the overall framework of Canalside for seven years and presented the DGEIS to the public in Octobor 2009. This plan included several amenities that would complement the latter scrapped Bass Pro Shops flagship store.Canals that function as reflecting pools with a freezing system were built to replicate the historic Erie Canal and Main-Hamburg Canals. The canals were constructed on the old Memorial Auditorium site and were completed in 2014. The canals have water in the spring and summer and ice in the winter for skating and ice biking.\n\n\n=== Economic development ===\nThe first major private development in Canalside was the renovation of the Donovan State Office Building, now known as One Canalside. This project consisted of a hotel, restaurant and office space. Construction began in 2012 and was completed by 2014.The second major development was the Buffalo Sabres' hockey themed LECOM Harborcenter. The development is the most expensive privately funded single building in the history of the City of Buffalo. Construction of the project began in March 2013. The building contains two NHL sized hockey rinks, a parking garage, restaurants, a Marriott hotel and retail space. The building was fully completed in 2015.On June 24, 2016, Canalside hosted the FanFest for the 2016 NHL Draft which was hosted next door in First Niagara Center.\nIn 2017, construction began on the Explore & More Children's Museum at Canalside on the South Aud Block. The museum houses a caf\u00e9 and museum, retail space, along with four floors of dedicated uses and a rooftop terrace which is open to visitors of all ages. It opened in 2019.\n\n\n=== Future development ===\n\nFuture plans for Canalside include a pavilion near the commercial slip which will be about 5,000 square feet and be constructed as a masonry-and-steel open structure that recalls a historic 19th-century building. It will have approximately 1,000 square feet of enclosed space for toilets and concessions, as well as an approximately 2,000-square-foot elevated outdoor deck above. The pavilion will have the ability to lengthen Canalside's programming seasons, and house seasonal markets, recurring programming, and private events. Plans also call for a second building called the Union Block Building which will have an approximately 2,800-square-foot one-story ground level that will be fully enclosed and environmentally controlled and an open 1,800-square-foot crawl space at the slip tow path below and an open-air roof of approximately 3,000 square feet partially enclosed on three sides by masonry walls recalling window portals to enable outdoor gathering uses, including observation of Canalside and the waterfront, public programming, private events, and/or interpretive gatherings. Restrooms, visitor information, and public programming spaces are proposed at the ground level.In early August 2018, the State of New York committed $14 million to two projects at Canalside. $10 million was designated for the recreation of the historic street grid, underground parking and infrastructure within the North Aud Block, and $4 million was earmarked for the creation of \"Longshed,\" an interactive building and exhibit surrounding a replica 19th-century packet boat that sailed on the Erie Canal.On August 20, 2018, it was announced that Sinatra and Company, a Buffalo based developer, would develop the two South Aud Block parcels. Their plans included two 5-story mixed-use buildings with canal access and the first residences within the district. It is scheduled to be completed by Memorial Day 2020.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nExplore & More Children's Museum \u2014 opened in 2019\nBuffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park \u2014 opened 1979, reconstructed in 2012\n\n\n=== Ships ===\nUSS The Sullivans (DD-537)\u2014Fletcher-class destroyer\nUSS Little Rock (CL-92)\u2014Cleveland-class cruiser; its successor, USS Little Rock (LCS-9) was christened at Canalside in December 2017\nUSS Croaker\u2014Gato-class submarine\n\n\n=== Entertainment venues ===\n\n\n==== Sports ====\nKeyBank Center (home of the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bandits, formerly known as First Niagara Center, HSBC Arena and Marine Midland Arena)\nThe Rinks at LECOM Harborcenter (home of Canisius Golden Griffins men's ice hockey, and the Buffalo Jr. Sabres)\n\n\n=== Notable architecture ===\n\"Shark Girl\", Pop art sculpture designed by Casey Riordan Millard\n\n\n=== Other attractions ===\nThe Ice at Canalside\u2014frozen canals in operation as ice rinks in the winter\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nCanalside is served by various modes of transportation, including public transit, intercity rail and several highways. The Erie Canal Harbor station of the Buffalo Metro Rail lies directly on Main Street. Amtrak's Buffalo\u2013Exchange Street station is less than a mile to the east, underneath Interstate 190 which forms Canalside's northern border. A bike ferry also provides access to the Buffalo Outer Harbor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park\nErie Canal\nLECOM Harborcenter\nLarkinville\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanalside is covered in the  Downtown Buffalo travel guide from Wikivoyage.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nCanalside Official Site\nErie Canal Harbor Development Corporation Official Site\n\n\n=== Historical ===\nMaps of Buffalo's Erie Canal District then and now\nThe Relationship of the Canal to Buffalo and its Harbor, 1845-2000: a collection of maps and images",

This was nice and probably a lot of fun with an event going on, but if it weren\u2019t for the Navy ships, planes and submarines on display there really wouldn\u2019t be anything for adults to do.

          "Yes every city has an attraction like this, but Canalside has the Erie canal history and the Naval museum also. Fun place to spend an hour or two on the weekend and grab a drink. Street entertainment, art fairs, etc.",
          "It's really nice that stuff is finally happening down at Canalside and it's definitely an improvement over the gravel lots that used to occupy the space. As waterfronts go, it is still pretty desolate and lacking in services and amenities when there isn't an event going on.",
          "The water front in Buffalo has been revitalized and the canal side area is a wonderful venue for a sunny day walk. Many food vendors, the site of many concerts and festivals and more businesses than I can recount are just steps away.",
          "Although parking can be tough to find, it's worth the hassle. There are so many neat events held here to participate in, and it's simply a nice relaxing area to take a walk in or have an ice cream cone at. There are places to eat nearby, the naval park is connected to it...",
          "This entire area is WONDERFUL! We walked all the way our to the end of the \"pier\" and watched the sailboats coming and going for quite a while. Just gorgeous. Bring along your camera for great shots of the lighthouse.",
          "What a great place for a walk and to enjoy the canal. There was lots of parking free parking on the side streets a short walk away. Lots of activities were available; yoga, face painting, foozball, kayak rentals, dancing (music) etc. You will have a good time. Wear comfortable",
          "Wonderful place to spend a day. So much to see and do. Highly recommend a boat tour to learn about the interesting history of Buffalo and view the fantastic silos. Looking forward to returning to kayak and tour the navy boats. We were however very very disappointed with the",
          "Check schedule to see what is happening, music, holiday specific events etc. Good view of grain silos that are lit up with continuously changing light show. Interesting art (silent poets) and much history of the terminus of the famous Erie Canal. Right on the Buffalo river,",
          "A nice area to visit. During the summer, there are vendors and even locals who help with excercise routines, etc. Not the most exciting place, but it's free and it's scenic. On the street parking can be found, but fills up quickly.",
          "Very nice relaxing, the boat rides looked good, didn't have yhe time, though. There was some street parking, could get crowded on the weekend.",
          "Alot of things to do. We went on a ghost walk later that day. There is a military ship you can explore. You can watch the boats go by. Nice sunset.",
          "I live in Buffalo, so I go there very often. They are always improving the grounds to make everything nicer. There is always some fun event going on there, whether it is a play or a band performing. They also have great food. Make sure to check out the 716 Sports Bar!",

          "This was just a wasteland a decade ago. A nice place to enjoy the canal, take the kids, get something to eat, walk the park, tour the boats. A nice days' worth of good, clean fun.",
          "The entertainment and food are very good. You can either sit back, relax and enjoy the sounds, sights and food or jump right in and party. Family friendly but leave pets at home. If you come in a boat, you can fish a little, watch the fireworks, sunsets or just enjoy the",
          "Nice place for a stroll offers greenery and water downtown with historical placards and industrial information on the buffalo waterfront.",
          "Whether it's cold or warm, I love going to Canalside. In the winter you can ice skate for relatively cheap and warm-up indoors with hot chocolate by the ice or at Tim Horton's across the street. When you pay admission you get a colored wrist band and there is no time limit - in",
          "Buffalo finally has a large, waterfront boardwalk with adjacent park that anyone can enjoy! Recently went down during a cold snap, but it was still a nice way to see the water and get outside. We always enjoy looking at the military vessels on display there. Downsides are",
          "The pride of Buffalo. Always something going on during all four seasons. Just walking around this excellent designed area is good as well.",
          "I have been to Canalside for many events and to just take a walk. We have been there for the Duck, free concerts, the hockey draft party, craft shows, paint nights, lunch, and just a walk after dinner. It is one of my favorite places in Buffalo! There is always something going",

          "The Canal side area has something for everyone. In the winter there is ice skating and ice bikes! So fun! In the summer there are arts and crafts fairs and carnivals. Plenty of great restaurants- on the water is The Liberty Hound which has great adults beverages! Outdoor patio",
          "Canalside was a great place to stop and walk around. They have war memorials, navy ships, and submarines. This are was a great place to see and take photos.",
          "For many years this waterfront lay waated, but now there are many things that you and your family can enjoy. There is a wonderful memorial to our fallen soldiers as well as a Military Museum with interactive displays. Outside there are huge Adirondack chairs to sit and relax",

          "Great place to take friends. Enjoy taking people who are originally from Buffalo. They can't believe how the water front is changing. Fun as well as relaxing.",
          "Once you've been there once you've seen it all. Nice place for a stroll but if there is an event it gets congested. I would like to see the city offer more than the canalside.",
          "Home to many festivals and events. Several attractions are close by. Buffalo Naval Park with the Liberty Hound restaurant. Harbor Center ice arena, 716 Restaurant, the cobblestone district.",
          "What a really great location - liberty hound restaurant- sit outside if you can- watch the boats go by- seating by the large ships there doesn't feel like city of buffalo feels like a vacation - food is good limited menu service friendly",

          "Its a great place to hang out for a day. There is plenty to do at Canalside as well as around canalside and a lot of great restaurants within walking distance",
          "Been there many times. Great place to just enjoy being outside by the water or for a bite to eat. Lots of restaurants in the area. The only bad part is not a lot of parking unless uoy want to pay",
          "I love going over there by my bike there so many trials back there. Nice to get away from it all. There are so many things to do over there. Even if you are by yourself.",
          "Once finished, this area will be a world class attraction including a children's museum. Beautifully maintained and convenient to other Buffalo attractions.",
          "Canalside if probably the crown jewel of the Buffalo resurgence at this point. It's beautiful! You can go there at anytime in the day and it always looks great. I couldn't say more about how wonderful it is. In the summer there are always activities going on. If you're bored",
          "Canalside had become one of the most versatile areas of the city drawing people from all parts of the world. The view into the harbor and walking path along the canal to the viewing tower is a great, Free amenity. There are a ton of great restaurants down there as well, all",
          "Canalside is a wonderful venue for families, couples and singles alike. There are various activities, restaurants and sights within the immediate area. There is a lot to do in both winter and summer seasons. Worth it to check it out!",

          "The new canalside in Downtown Buffalo is great. Many maritime activities including ship tours and boat rides up the canal. Good restaurant and plenty of open lawn space for a picnic. Many concerts are now held down here. Great improvement for the waterfront and a new gem for",
          "Try curling ! It's so much fun!! Be careful in the ice. And be prepared for a long waiver to sign. Definitely worth the price for one hour of fun with friends/ family.",
          "Stopped at canalside on our way to sabers game - ice skating - and some vendors, it was warm and part of curling was wet - security and workers were friendly and helpful",
          "I go to Canalside early morning on the weekends. Personally, that's the best time to go. Once it's crowded, you can't enjoy the peacefulness. My friend and I have gone there early and went kayaking. It's awesome! But if you're going to do any watersports, do it early! I love",
          "Went to have a casual, impromptu lunch with a friend when there was NO crowd. It was very relaxing and nice, almost felt like I was on vacay. Gotta do it again.",
          "I attempted to attend an event the end of July 2016. By 9:30PM, access to Canalside was closed off due to excessive crowds.Trying to leave by car was a nightmare. After waiting 40 minutes to get to Main Street we stopped in the closest bar. It was over an hour until the traffic",

          "We specifically went to try the Ice Bikes, a unique way to glide across the ice. It was a Saturday afternoon and very busy, but we were able to get bikes without waiting. Peddling on ice is harder then a regular bike, but great fun! Negatives: - The rink is very, very small.",
          "Free concerts in the summer on Thursdays is a highlight. There are so many activates and festivals that are added. I recommend renting a kayak and going down the Buffalo River through the grain elevators.",
          "Canalside has evolved into a year round attraction. Plenty to see and do. Paddle boats and water bikes in summer; ice skating and ice bikes in winter. Beautiful views of Buffalo and the waterfront.",

          "If your looking to beat cabin fever or want a fun evening out put canalside on your list of winter \"must do\" list. Go skating, shoot pool, go for a ride on an ice bike or try a pick up game of curling. If people watching is more you style sit back with a hot chocolate or",

          "While visiting family in Buffalo for a long weekend recently, we came to Canalside for the newly opened ice skating. We had the best time, and it was super reasonably priced. Getting rental skates, changing into them, and getting on the ice was super easy. Then we skated our",

          "Buffalo has done a great job in revitalizing its downtown core, and this park area located right next to the Hockey rink is a great example of that. It's a very nicearea to walk around in, and I can only imagine how beautiful it would be during the summer. There is a military",
          "We went on a cool Autumn day. There were very few other people strolling around, so we were able to see everything. There were a few boats on the river. The travelling art show was great. The various memorials to Buffalo residents from various wars were very moving. Seeing the",

        "wiki": "Buffalo Harbor State Park is a 190-acre (0.77 km2) state park and marina on the shore of Lake Erie in the city of Buffalo in Erie County, New York. The park encompasses Gallagher Beach, the former NFTA Small Boat Harbor, and the waterfront land in between.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuffalo Harbor State Park was created in 2014 from a portion of a larger transfer of 340 acres (1.4 km2) of land from the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority to the Empire State Development Corporation. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was scheduled to take over park operations in November 2014. The $15 million development of the new park is part of an overall initiative to revitalize Buffalo's outer harbor.The park officially opened to the public on May 24, 2015. Although first-year visitors praised the park's modern playground, some marina slipholders expressed displeasure with the marina's new operator, a private company from Tennessee.A second phase of park improvements, featuring $3.76 million in breakwall and revetment enhancements for the park's harbor, was announced in November 2015. Plans call for the installation of a paved walkway and bike path for accessing the breakwall, in addition to improved lighting and a new fishing platform. The improvements are scheduled to be completed by fall 2016.\n\n\n== Park facilities ==\nThe park features a 1,000 slip marina, boat launches, a fish cleaning station, a nautical-themed playground, and picnic pavilions, and a restaurant. A beach is also available, however swimming is not permitted as of 2015. Kayak rentals and improvements to the park's restaurant, including the addition of an 1,800-square-foot (170 m2) patio, were announced in 2016.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New York state parks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew York State Parks: Buffalo Harbor State Park",

        "wiki": "Electric Tower (or General Electric Tower) is a historic office building and skyscraper located at the corner of Washington and Genesee Streets in Buffalo. It is the seventh tallest building in Buffalo. It stands 294 feet (89.6 m) and 14 stories tall and is in the Beaux-Arts Classical Revival style. It was designed by James A. Johnson and built in 1912. The tower was based upon an earlier Electric Tower constructed for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition; as with most of the buildings constructed for that event, the original was only temporary and demolished shortly after the fair ended. Additions were made in 1923 and 1928. The white terra-cotta clad was originally built as the Niagara Mohawk Building and features an octagonal tower which steps back three times to terminate in a large lantern. It is also known as Iskalo Electric Tower, for the real estate development company that owns the building.The decorative symbols featuring aspects of electricity production are considered precursors to subsequent art deco design.\nLike One M & T Plaza, the spire of the tower is illuminated with different holiday colors at night throughout the year. Both buildings are illuminated blue and gold for the Buffalo Sabres during the National Hockey League playoffs.\nThe Electric Tower hosts the annual Buffalo Ball Drop on New Year's Eve, one of the continent's largest ball drops outside the New York City ball drop. People from all around gather in Roosevelt Plaza to ring in and celebrate the New Year. The Buffalo Ball Drop is accompanied by live performances and a spectacular firework show.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo\nNiagara Hudson Building, in Syracuse, also known as \"Niagara Mohawk Building\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneral Electric Tower - Buffalo, NY - U.S. National Register of Historic Places on Waymarking.com\n\"Niagara Mohawk Building\".

Records show that the imperial palaces had gardens by the 5th century ce, their chief characteristic being a pond with an islet connected to the shore by bridges\u2014as is shown by later references to these precedents in Emperor Sh\u014dmu\u2019s (724\u2013756) three gardens in Nara. During the Heian period (794\u20131185), when the symmetrical shinden style of architecture prevailed, the main garden was laid out on the southern side of the house. With the change of domestic architecture in the Kamakura period (1192\u20131333), however, came modifications of the garden. Learned Zen priests, who assiduously studied the art of garden making, gave Buddhistic names to different rocks in the design and linked religio-philosophic principles with landscape lore. Other beliefs further complicated garden design. With the Muromachi period (1338\u20131573) came popularization of gardens, which were designed to be enjoyed not only as views to contemplate but as microcosms to explore. The subjective mood became dominant and the gardens reflected individuality. People demanded shibumi in their gardens\u2014an unassuming quality in which refinement underlies a commonplace appearance, perceptible only to a cultivated taste. Aesthetic priests, \u201ctea men,\u201d and connoisseurs created new forms of gardens for cha-shitsu, the little pavilions or rooms built for the chanoyu (tea ceremony), and a special style developed which revolutionized Japanese garden art.Garden of the Kinkaku Temple showing the use of a shelter structure, the Golden Pavilion, as the main focal point of a landscape design, 15th century, Ky\u014dto.Consulate General of Japan, New YorkPond and moss-covered bridge, Katsura Imperial Gardens, Ky\u014dto, Japan.William G. Froelich, Jr.The succeeding vogue of designing in three different degrees of elaboration\u2014shin, gyo, and so (\u201celaborate,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cabbreviated\u201d)\u2014was also adopted for gardens. Many splendid gardens were produced in the Momoyama (1574\u20131600) and Edo (1603\u20131867) periods. The centre of garden activity gradually shifted, however, from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo), seat of the Tokugawa shogun. At one stage there was a utilitarian development: a duck pond was added in the Hama detached palace in Tokyo and, in the Koraku-yen at Mito, space was made for the cultivation of reeds for arrow shafts and plums for military supplies. Feudal lords generally had fine gardens in their provincial homes as well. Quite a number of gardens survived the abolition of the feudal system after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, yet many celebrated gardens perished through neglect or were sacrificed to modern progress. The establishment of public parks, which were not unknown even in feudal times, was especially encouraged throughout Japan from 1873. Gardens in Western style came in with other Western modes but made little headway. The great earthquake and fire of 1923 demonstrated a utilitarian value of the Tokyo gardens: tens of thousands found safety in the parks and in large private gardens scattered throughout the city.Ritsurin Garden, Takamatsu, JapanCamera Tokyo Service ",

        "wiki": "St. Paul's Cathedral is the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York and a landmark of downtown Buffalo, New York. The church sits on a triangular lot bounded by Church St., Pearl St., Erie St., and Main St.  It was built in 1849-51 to a design by Richard Upjohn, and was believed by him to be his finest work.   Its interior was gutted by fire in 1888, and was redesigned thereafter by Robert W. Gibson, and it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its architecture.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1848, vestrymen of St. Paul's in Buffalo formed a building committee to erect a new stone church. Being familiar with architect Richard Upjohn's work through his recently completed Trinity Church in New York City, they desired no other architect for the job, and immediately engaged Upjohn for the commission.Major structural events:;\n1849: construction started.\n1851: the cathedral was dedicated/consecrated.\n1870: the spires on top of the two towers were finished.\n1888: a fire caused by a natural gas explosion nearly destroyed the building.\n1890: the church reopened after undergoing a renovation overseen by Robert W. Gibson.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral in 1973.  In 1987, the property was further declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe cathedral has an irregular plan, whose largest component is the nave.  It is built out of native red sandstone with an ashlar finish.  The walls of the nave are supported by buttresses crowned with Gothic finials.  The main tower and entrance portal are at the southwestern end; the tower rises 275 feet (84 m), with a tall steeple topped by a cross.  A small tower rises 125 feet (38 m) from the north end.  The interior features floors of slate and marble mosaic, with the floor around the altar made in France.  The altar is of Mexican onyx, and the chancel furnishings is of oak, all designed by Robert Gibson.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the Episcopal cathedrals of the United States\nList of cathedrals in the United States\nList of National Historic Landmarks in New York\nNational Register of Historic Places in Buffalo, New York\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. NY-5612, \"St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, Shelton Square, Buffalo, Erie County, NY\", 12 photos, 9 data pages\nSkyscraper page building entry\nEmporis building entry\nThe cathedral's baptisms, confirmations, marriages, and burial records, 1812-1970, are online courtesy of FamilySearch.org.",

        "wiki": "Broderick Park is a park situated along the Niagara River in Buffalo, New York, United States.\n\n\n== Location and recreational opportunities ==\nBroderick Park, following an elongated shape, is located on the southern tip of Unity Island between the Niagara River and the Black Rock Canal. The park overlooks the Canada\u2013US border and is situated within view of the Peace Bridge, which links the State of New York with the Canadian Province of Ontario at Fort Erie.\nBroderick Park offers recreational facilities for local residents and visitors. Under the Buffalo Micro Parks system within the City of Buffalo, contribution is made toward the maintenance and improvement of amenities.\n\n\n== Historical significance to Underground Railroad ==\nGiven the park's proximity to Canada, it is historically important in that it served as a transit area for African-Americans heading for the border on the opposite side of the Niagara River from the park. The park occupies an area that once housed docks for the Black Rock Ferry, which is known to have transported fugitive slaves to Canada as part of the Underground Railroad.These activities were particularly precipitated by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which to some measure brought about the 'nationalizing' of some of the consequences of the slavery practiced in the Southern states, and hence the increased flow of African-Americans travelers seeking liberty in Canada. Ironically it was Buffalo's own Millard Fillmore who, as President of the United States, signed this measure into law. (See also: Millard Fillmore - Policies.)\nAfter the American Civil War period and the Emancipation Proclamation, the Park ceased to have the same clandestine focus for traveling African-Americans.\n\n\n=== Reenactments and commemorations ===\nReenactments and commemorations of Underground Railroad events have been regularly held at Broderick Park under the sponsorship of Buffalo Quarters Historical Society. In 2010, Broderick Park was recognized by the U.S. National Park Service as a National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site.\n\n\n== Recent developments ==\nBroderick Park \u2014 visibly close to the Peace Bridge \u2014 has sometimes been used as a backdrop to public meetings on subjects of law and administrative reform as they may relate to cross-border issues.In 2008, funding shortfalls led to an unsuccessful proposal calling for Broderick Park to be transferred from the City of Buffalo to the State of New York, to become part of a future state park.In 2012, plans were announced for a $1.5 million revitalization of the park, with plans for a new amphitheater, improved facilities, and a new memorial celebrating the park's involvement in the Underground Railroad. The project commenced in 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanada\u2013United States border\nUnderground Railroad\nFugitive Slave Law - Effects\nBlack Rock - History\nFort Erie - Underground Railroad\nList of crossings of the Niagara River\nNiagara River - Islands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNiagara River Greenway Commission - Broderick Park Master Plan",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "5 Wits is a chain entertainment venue that builds interactive adventure experiences with seven locations in the United States. 5 Wits adventures are compared to and have some similarities with Escape Room Games, but are placed in a separate category and not considered escape games. It has been called the first of this type of attraction, having first opened to the public in October 2004.\n\n\n== Description ==\nEach location features interactive adventures with themes such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, a high tech spy mission, outer space, ancient Egypt, and medieval fantasy. In each adventure, a group of 2-12 guests are faced with puzzles and challenges they must overcome as a team as they work to progress through a series of rooms and complete their mission. There are computer controlled lighting and sound effects, optical illusions, and a wide variety of physical and mental puzzles and electromechanical effects.  Guests can succeed or fail, and each adventure has multiple endings that will change based on how the group performs and what decisions the group makes.The Foxboro, MA location at Patriot Place is unique in that it is the only location where a staff member, called 'adventure guide' goes with the group to help set the tone and if the group gets stuck, can provide clues. The adventures in Foxboro last approximately 50 minutes based on the group's ability to solve the challenges.\nThe other 5 Wits locations all provide automated adventures, where the guides do not accompany guests through. The adventures in these locations last approximately 30 minutes based on the group's ability to solve the challenges.\n\n\n=== Adventures ===\nDeep Space (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo) - A futuristic adventure where adventure goers get teleported to an abandoned starship and they must work together to figure out what happened to the crew, but not everything is what it seems.\nDrago's Castle (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo, Erie, Arlington) - A medieval fantasy where adventure goers help a magical princess catch a fire-breathing dragon before it can destroy her world and theirs.\nEspionage (Foxboro, Syracuse, Erie, Arlington) - A spy adventure where adventure goers become secret agents and must infiltrate the bad guy's base and foil his plans. The Espionage adventures are very different with Foxboro's involving a bomb, while Syracuse, Arlington, and Plymouth Meeting have missiles that must be disarmed.\nTomb (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo, Erie, Arlington) - An Indiana Jones style adventure where adventure goers must answer the riddles of a long dead pharaoh or else be trapped forever.\n20,000 Leagues (Foxboro) - Based on the book by Jules Verne, the group must repair a broken down submarine and battle a sea monster to reach the surface.\n\n\n== Origin of the Name ==\n5 Wits is named after the five inward wits from the writings of William Shakespeare and Stephen Hawes.  These five wits were common sense, imagination, estimation, fantasy, and memory, though there are also clear associations to the five senses.  Each 5 Wits adventure requires the use of the five inward wits and is designed to immerse guests fully in a \"5 senses themed\" experience.\n\n\n== History ==\n5 Wits was incorporated in 2003 by founder and president Matthew DuPlessie.  The original business plan for 5 Wits, first called the Puzzle Room, was written and entered into the business plan competition at Harvard Business School in early 2003.  5 Wits' first location opened in October 2004 at 186 Brookline Avenue, Boston MA, hosting TOMB, 5 Wits first adventure.  In 2006, 5 Wits spun off a sister company, Box Fort [1], (originally called 5 Wits Productions) to design and build walk-through adventures for its growing business and provide services for third-party clients like museums, theaters, and theme parks.  In 2007, 5 Wits opened Operation Spy, an hour long walk-through adventure inside the International Spy Museum.  In 2010, 5 Wits moved the original TOMB [2] adventure to Pigeon Forge, TN, selling it to a third party. The original TOMB continues to operate but is no longer owned or operated by 5 Wits. Meanwhile, a new 5 Wits location opened in August of that same year in Foxboro MA at Patriot Place hosting Espionage and 20,000 Leagues.  Since then, multiple new locations have opened, primarily in New York state.  5 Wits continues to expand, with new stores currently planned.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nThe company's seven venues are located in:\n\nFoxboro, Massachusetts, at Patriot Place, just across from Gillette Stadium, home of the NFL's New England Patriots.\nSyracuse, New York, at Destiny USA.\nWest Nyack, New York, at Palisades Center. This location opened in 2016 in a space that was an IMAX theater in the mall.\nAlbany, New York, at Crossgates Mall. This location is nearly identical to the West Nyack location.\nBuffalo, New York, at Walden Galleria.\nErie, Pennsylvania, at Millcreek Mall\nArlington, Virginia, a new location at Ballston Quarter opened February 2019.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",

          "My corporate team and I came here for a group outing. The puzzles are fun and really well designed for group teamwork, communication and cooperation. They aren't especially hard so if you want a tough escape challenge look elsewhere but the \u2026",
          "It was fun. Did the Deep space adventure; the adventure is guided and gets progressively more challenging as you go along. It was a different approach compared to the escape rooms I have visited previously. Worth a visit",
          "I did the space room. It was a lot of fun, however it was not an escape room like it claims. All you do is a series of tasks. There is no searching for clues or finding answers like a normal escape room. It was very disappointing,  especially since I paid $50 for two of us and it was a bust.",
          "We had a lot of time and tried all three adventures, which ended up having over 1.5 hours of fun. And we\u2019re both around the mid 20\u2019s age range and we didn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re too old for it or anything. Some of the tasks/puzzles were quite \u2026",
          "I have gone to 5 Wits at least 4 times already and each time I do all three attractions. I have gone with children (10 and 12 years old) a teenager (15 years old) and adults. My groups have ranged from 2-4 people and I loved each moment of \u2026",
          "It's a great environment for kids and adults a like however, I felt a little rushed in the rooms. I understand the adventures are timed and you can't spend all day on one section but a little more time for the puzzles would be nice.",
          "It was fun! I planned it as a party of a work gathering. I did not like that I could not make reservations prior, I also think that once you go and do all 3 activities it would not be worth going again until they switch them up.

          "Saw the lighthouse from the harbor but no sense in walking/driving over to see it up close as it was chained shut. Our boat captain said it is open for tours only a couple of days a year ... and the day we were there wasn't it. Shame.",

        "wiki": "Lafayette Square (formerly Court House Park or Courthouse Square) is a park in the center of downtown Buffalo, Erie County, New York, United States that hosts a Civil War monument. The block, which was once square, is lined by many of the city's tallest buildings.  The square was named for General Lafayette, who visited Buffalo in 1825.The square was part of the original urban plan for the city as laid out by Joseph Ellicott in 1804. Its eastern edge has long been defined by important civic structures; first, the Erie County Courthouse, followed by the original Buffalo & Erie County Public Library.  Presidential history was made in Lafayette Square when former United States President Martin Van Buren received the Free Soil Party nomination for the 1848 election.  President-elect Abraham Lincoln also spoke at the square.Today, the square offers a clear view of Buffalo City Hall, an Art Deco building three blocks to the west.  A granite Civil War monument, titled Soldiers and Sailors, gives a strong vertical and ceremonial definition to the space.  Conceived by Mrs. Horatio Seymour, the monument's dedication ceremony was attended by Grover Cleveland and other prominent figures. Until 2011, Lafayette Square hosted the annual Thursday at the Square summer concert series and is occasionally the site of rallies and demonstrations.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nLafayette Square is one of three squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most important space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).Buildings flanking the square include the Liberty Building, the Main Court Building, 10 Lafayette Square, the Rand Building (14 Lafayette Square), and the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library (One Lafayette Square).  The south side of the square hosts two historic buildings: the 300-room Lafayette Hotel, designed by Louise Blanchard Bethune in 1904; and the Brisbane building, designed by Milton Earl Beebe and erected by James Mooney and James Brisbane in 1894\u20135.  The corner north of the current library and northeast of the square once hosted the Buffalo Savings Bank building that was demolished in 1922.\n\nLafayette Square is served by several Metro Bus routes and the Lafayette Square rapid transit rail station of Buffalo's Metro Rail system. In 2003, Lafayette Square became the site of the first free municipal wifi hotspot in the city.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Square ===\n\nThe square once was surrounded by an iron fence that was no longer present by 1905. By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park. In 1876-7, trees that lined the square along main street were removed.Lafayette Square was the last park in the heart of the city, but the commercialization of the downtown area caused vehicular space demands. The original parklike square was originally viewed by urban planners as an impediment to crosstown traffic.    In 1912, the Buffalo Common Council authorized the extension of Broadway to Main Street through Lafayette Square, which reduced the size of the square \"to devote to street purposes all that part of the Square except for a small circle around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument.\"  The square has since been redeveloped a few times and is now more of a thoroughfare than a park.  In 1920, the square circumscribed a vehicular circle with the monument in the center surrounded by sidewalks and grass.\n\n\n=== Monument ===\nThe monument's shaft supports a 10-foot-6-inch (3.2 m) female figure, and four 8-foot (2.4 m) bronze statues, representing the infantry, artillery, cavalry and navy, sculpted by Caspar Buberl, which face the four cardinal points.  Bronze bas-reliefs encircle the column above the statues.  The female figure is an allegorical figure representing the Union.  By the time of the 1979 report for the Mayor's Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs, two plaques were missing from the monument.The dedication on the west (Main Street) side honors those who laid down their lives \"in the war to maintain the union for the cause of their country and of mankind.\" Half of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address graces the east side of the monument. Several bas-relief panels feature scenes of Lincoln's original cabinet: Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase, Secretary of State William H. Seward, Attorney General Edward Bates, Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, Secretary of the Interior, Caleb Smith, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, Major General Winfield Scott, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAt one time, a rivulet flowed from Lafayette Square down Court Street where it eventually met a stream at Niagara and Mohawk Streets.  The square hosted the Niagara County Courthouse from 1810 until it was destroyed by the British Army during the Burning of Buffalo during the War of 1812 on December 30, 1813.  In 1831, the Holland Land Company gave the deed of the public park to the city.The original Erie County court house was built facing the square park in 1818.  Buffalo was the county seat of Niagara County until 1821, when Erie County was created. In 1833 an adjacent county jailhouse was added.  The jail, which was crude, and a debtors' prison were located in the back of the courthouse.  In 1853, the city fenced in the square and installed a US$30,000 ($921,960 today) fountain. Erie County Sheriff Grover Cleveland once personally hanged a criminal in the square when it was still named Court House Square, after his subordinates refused to do so.  President-elect Abraham Lincoln spoke at the square on February 16, 1861. The courthouse was used as the place for the determination of justice for the American side of the Niagara River until it was abandoned on March 11, 1876.\n\nA Cyrus Eidlitz Buffalo Public Library building was first erected on the Court House's location and dedicated on February 7, 1887.  The current Buffalo & Erie County Public Library building that replaced Eidlitz's building was constructed between 1961 and 1963. Eidlitz had won an architectural competition against the likes of Henry Richardson, who was regarded as the nation\u2019s top architect at the time.  The gargoyles of the Romanesque Eidlitz building were widely respected and admired.  However, they were not saved due to prohibitive expense at the time of the early 1960s demolition.In 1825 American Revolutionary War veteran and French General Lafayette visited this square during his historic tour of the United States and gave a speech in the square.  He spoke on a platform in front of the Eagle Tavern, a highly regarded hotel in its day, on June 4 as part of ceremonies to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the war.  That same year, Buffalo carried out its last official public hanging when brothers Israel, Isaac and Nelson Thayer were hanged for murdering John Love, which some accounts say occurred in the square, while others say it was at Niagara Square. The square hosted many public meetings and early Erie County Fairs, such as the October 1841 fair that was held in the square and behind the courthouse.In 1848, the Free Soil Party, which was absorbed into the Republican Party in 1854, held its national nominating convention in Buffalo. At the convention, the party selected former New York Governor and former United States President Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams as their nominees for United States President and United States Vice President for the 1848 election.  Forty thousand people witnessed the event at the square.  The square has hosted several notable speakers such as Henry Clay in 1842 and Daniel Webster in 1833.The first meeting regarding the erection of a Civil War monument was held on April 14, 1866.  Efforts stalled until Mrs. Horatio Seymour organized the Ladies Union Monument Association on July 2, 1874, which raised $12,000 ($271,165) and approved a design by George Keller.  Following this proactive effort, the city of Buffalo approved an additional $45,000 ($1,016,868) for the project.  Support for the monument effort coalesced when public interest in and support for an arch by Henry Hobson Richardson at Niagara Square in front of Buffalo City Hall faded. In 1879, the name of the square was changed from Court House Park to Lafayette Square.\n\nThen-Mayor of Buffalo Grover Cleveland laid the cornerstone of Keller's 85-foot (25.9 m) granite-shaft Soldiers and Sailors monument in the center of the square on July 4, 1882 and returned as New York Governor to dedicate the monument July 4, 1884.  When the cornerstone was laid with military pomp and Masonic ritual, Cleveland spoke, and a time capsule was sealed away. In addition, Brigadier General Stewart Woodford made remarks at the first ceremony. Woodford was among several notable people who attended the dedication, including Pennsylvania Governor John Hartranft and Brigadier General William Findlay Rogers.  Columns of Union Army veterans marched down Main Street to celebrate the day.The monument has survived two significant threats.  First, in 1889, the foundation was found to have settled unevenly, causing a dangerous tilt similar to that of the Tower of Pisa.  The square was cracking and crumbling due to an inadequate core of rubble and mortar to support the granite shaft and statuary.  In addition the copper box time capsule was found to be three feet below its intended chamber and cracked with its contents destroyed.  The monument was dismantled and rebuilt with an expanded 15-foot (4.6 m) base.  On February 12, 1973, a motorist drove his vehicle into the monument, prompting calls for its demolition by 1982 by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority.  Instead, the monument was repaired through fundraising efforts by the Buffalo Civil War Round Table involving a successful public awareness campaign.\n\n\n== Today ==\nEvery summer from 1986 to 2011, Buffalo Place, Inc. hosted a free concert series, called Thursday at the Square on Thursday evenings in Lafayette Square, starting in May and running until September. A typical schedule includes a wide variety of musical acts. As of 2012 the concert series has been move to the Buffalo inner harbor and renamed Thursday at Canalside.Because of its central, symbolic location, Lafayette Square is often chosen for various rallies. After the Buffalo Bills were defeated in Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills fans held a rally at the square to show their continuing support of  the team. On January 16, 1981, there were a set of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day at Lafayette Square, Niagara Square and nearby areas by the Neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of America and opposing groups.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Buffalo\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBisco, Jim (1986).

        "wiki": "The Peace Bridge is an international bridge between Canada and the United States at the east end of Lake Erie at the source of the Niagara River, about 20 kilometres (12.4 mi) upriver of Niagara Falls. It connects Buffalo, New York, in the United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, in Canada. It is operated and maintained by the binational Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority.\nThe Peace Bridge consists of five arched spans over the Niagara River and a Parker deck type truss span over the Black Rock Canal on the American side of the river. The length is 5,800 feet (1.77 km). Material used in the construction included 3,500 feet (1.07 km) of steelwork, 9,000 tons of structural steel and 800 tons of reinforcing steel in the concrete abutments. The Peace Bridge was named to commemorate 100 years of peace between the United States and Canada. It was constructed as a highway bridge to address pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic which could not be accommodated on the International Railway Bridge, built in 1873.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe building of the Peace Bridge was approved by the International Joint Commission on August 6, 1925. Edward Lupfer served as chief engineer.  A major obstacle to building the bridge was the swift river current, which averages 7.5 to 12 miles per hour (12.1 to 19.3 km/h). Construction began in 1925 and was completed in the spring of 1927. On March 13, 1927, Lupfer drove the first car across the bridge. On June 1, 1927, the bridge was opened to the public.\nThe official opening ceremony was held two months later, on August 7, 1927, with about 100,000 in attendance.  The festivities were transmitted to the public via radio in the first international coast-to-coast broadcast.  Newspapers at the time estimated that as many as 50 million listeners may have heard the broadcast.The dignitaries who took part in the dedication ceremonies included The Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII), Prince George, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, U.S. Vice President Charles Dawes, Secretary of State Frank Kellogg, New York Governor Al Smith and Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson.When the bridge opened, Buffalo and Fort Erie each became the chief port of entry to their respective countries from the other. At the time it was the only vehicular bridge on the Great Lakes from Niagara Falls to New York. The bridge remains one of North America's important commercial ports with four thousand trucks crossing it daily.\nAfter new toll facilities were installed on the Canadian side in 2005, the Peace Bridge became the first E-ZPass facility outside the United States. There are no fees for entering the US.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\nThe Peace Bridge is one of the busiest on the Canada\u2013United States border, with over one million trucks crossing it each year and delays of up to almost four hours. Other nearby bridges between the United States and Canada include the Rainbow Bridge, the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. The Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Peace Bridge are the only Niagara River crossings that allow heavy trucks.\n\n\n== Customs inspection and toll plazas ==\nThere are customs plazas at both ends of the bridge, with the Canadian plaza the newer and larger of the two.\nThe inbound customs plaza in the United States has seven lanes for trucks and nine for cars. Pedestrians and cyclists are processed to the left of the truck inspection area.The inbound customs plaza in Canada was designed by NORR Limited Architects and Engineers and completed in 2010. There are 14 booths/lanes for cars and a separate area for trucks (handling five trucks at a time). Pedestrians and cyclists are processed in an area on the right side of the inspection area for cars.Once vehicles leave the customs plaza in Canada vehicles approach a smaller toll plaza to pay toll for using the Peace Bridge. Payment for tolls are either cash (US or Canadian), EZPass, as well as old Peace Bridge tokens. There are no toll booths on the US side and no tolls for pedestrians or cyclists.\n\n\n=== Preclearance ===\nIn October 2012 it was announced by the DHS and Public Safety Canada that a pilot program, years in the works, to preclear all truck traffic from Canada into Buffalo would be commenced. The pilot would start in late December 2012 and run for 18 months, after which the economic benefits would be assessed and its feasibility to make permanent would then be recommended to both U.S Congress and Canadian Parliament.\n\n\n== Road connections ==\nOn the New York side, Interstate 190 has a direct northbound off-ramp (exit 9) onto the Peace Bridge. This exit is signed as \"Ft Erie Can\" on I-190. On the Ontario side, the Queen Elizabeth Way begins after (and ends at) Canadian Customs plaza.\n\n\n== Commemorations ==\n\nBuffalo resident Emma M. Herold-Haft composed the Peace Bridge March in honor of the bridge's opening in 1927.\nCanada and the United States, on August 4, 1977, brought out a joint issue of postage stamps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bridge. Unusual for joint issues, the two designs are radically different (the US was all blue and the Canadian was a full colour).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of crossings of the Niagara River\nList of reference routes in New York\nPeace Bridge robins\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPeter R.

          "When traveling to the USA without a Nexus card, this is the fastest bridge to take. There is a bottle neck on the US side, but your wait time to get through customs is much faster. Stop at the Peace Bridge Duty Free Shop in Canada before crossing the border. It is a large,",
          "This bridge very seldom has the backups that you find at the Queenston or Rainbow bridges. The duty free store is very nice and I have always found the border guards on both sides to be pleasant and efficient even extending to offering directions when asked. This is the bridge",

          "Really enjoyed the theatre, the side exits are the best. I wish the pretzel concessions didn't have anything to put with them, but the roasted nuts were quite good. Seats were comfortable, bathroom could be a bit less cramped. Sound could have been better.",

          "O.M.G.! The place itself is worth seeing. Historic and so beautiful. I'd pay someone (architect/historian?) to give me a 3hour tour describing and explaining the significance of every little thing.  Nick Mason gave a spectacular performance, but the venue (almost) stole the show.  Turns out  my mom went here in the mid1940s.",
          "Teresa was great even though I didn't get a reading",

          "What a beautiful building!  I love the interior of Shea's, it is quite impressive. The architecture and decor rival the on stage acts, that's for sure. I even enjoy the somewhat maze-like lobby. I've never tried the concessions, so I can't \u2026",

          "Most recent visit was to attend the opera \"Shot\" which was well done but a bit uneven. The theater is plush now and comfortable but as before the sound system needs to be improved. We'll be back though since they get the best shows",
          "What an incredible experience. My wife and I snuck away for a date and took in Riverdance together. The theater is phenomenal. The greeters were wonderful. Having never been here before I had no idea where I was sitting or where I should go. All very friendly and helpful",

          "We took the 90 minute guided tour. Fascinating. This is such a beautiful theatre which was saved from the wrecker's ball and has been lovingly restored. It is a prime example of Buffalo in its heyday. This city has managed to retain so many of its architectural gems.",
          "I've been there for several shows and have sat in Orchestra, first tier and 2nd tier-bottom line, all great seats. They have everything form smaller productions all the way through Big Name productions-I just missed Tyler Perry in Madea on the Run. I did just see Beautiful,",

          "My wife and I saw the Blue Man Group last night and it was a great show. Very entertaining and was very crowd interactive. The tickets were a Christmas present from our oldest daughter and son in law. The theater is old but pretty well maintained. The seats are not for people",
          "The theatre has recently been restored to its original beauty. Seats are comfortable but not much room for the long-legged (see tip below). Plenty of fairly cheap parking in the immediate area and a few excellent restaurants which unsurprisingly get very busy at showtimes.",
          "This is a beautiful establishment and I have gone many times. This was the first time however that we made a mistake of the time of the show and they were very, very compassionate and found us seats for another show. Tom was the greatest. I only have one complaint and that",

          "Great time for the black tie affair (I wore just a good suit and tie). Dinner was good where they gave you two bottles of wine, a white and a red. The party on the street was crazy just checking out the other people. Food trucks where there from Chef's, Dinosaur's BBQ and other",

          "We arrived for a concert that had been cancelled in November due to the snow storm. We found that people were sitting in our seats. After the theater volunteer confirmed we both had the same seats he called down to the box office. A person met us at our seats and then took us",
          "Love this venue. Its an older Theatre, but the history is amazing. Always clean staff is wonderful. If you are there for a play or a comedy show it is comfotable seating, and you can see wherever you are seated.",
          "Although this is a beautiful venue for concerts and shows, I am very disappointed in the way my husband and I were treated here recently, and management's failure to address my concern. While attending a John Mellencamp concert in May, we were unaware of their \"no photos\"",
          "I visited Shea's recently to see \"The Book of Mormon\" and was pleasantly surprised by the overall change in the Theater District. A formerly decrepit block now looks completely different. The theater itself is as ornate and beautiful as ever with nice sight lines and acoustics.",
          "This is one of my favorite spots in Buffalo. They are doing an excellent job restoring this piece of Buffalo's past and bringing a taste of Broadway and other entertainment to Buffalo. Not to mention that tales of it's haunted history makes it worth taking a tour.",
          "This was my first year as a season ticket holder for the 2014/15 Performance schedule at Shea's Buffalo and I am renewing. Not only were the productions first rate- the venue in Buffalo is gem we should all be proud of. The restoration efforts over the past Decade have",

          "Wonderful vendors, the theatre itself is gorgeous. Highly recommend seeing! Very detailed and ornate, next time I hope to see a show.",
          "Came for the Mellencamp concert having missed it in our home town. The theater is very pretty architecturally. I liked the look of it, and for a concert the sound was very good! The seating inside is a bit tight, but we managed. Fair warning you can't take drinks in with you.",
          "While touring Buffalo we stopped here to see the building and were informed very rudely that we could not even stand just inside the door to look around - so don't count on checking this place out while strolling by. Don't even open the doors unless you want to be treated",
          "i liked everything about this place. Granted .. There is a lot of steps. But, the balcony is probably the best view you could get for a play. I enjoyed my visit.",
          "This is a great venue for any show but because of it's age it has its limitations. There is NO handicapped seating in upper level. Also, the ladies room on the 2nd level has only 3 stalls making intermission a real challenge. Leg room can be a challenge so if you are tall,",
          "Shea's is a beautiful venue. I've enjoyed many musicals and events there. After being injured, I found out that Shea's falls under as a historical building so it is not required to put in an elevator or handicapped accessible bathrooms. Bathrooms are in the basement via stairs.",
          "I went to an afternoon performance on the last day of the show's stay in Buffalo on their tour circuit. The theater itself is historic and beautiful, I enjoy every visit. The performance started out a bit slow for the first ten minutes or so while they laid out the intro, but",
          "My daughter and I attended the performance of Kinky Boots. The theater is breathtaking! It's worth the visit just to experience the theater itself if you like historical sites, but the show was amazing as well. The sound was great! I felt the price of the seats a little steep",

          "We saw Phantom of the Opera at Shea's this past weekend and everything about it was fantastic! Shea's is a Buffalo gem. It is beautiful inside and you could spend a lot of time wandering around looking at all of the ornate details, though it would be tough when there are so many",
          "My mother, my fiancee and I made a day trip to Buffalo after my mom surprised me with tickets to see the Phantom of the Opera at Shea's on March 19th. This was a pinnacle moment in my life. I have been dying to see phantom live for over 20 years. Shea's was absolutely",

          "Always enjoy going to this beautiful and historic theater in Buffalo. Buffalo is a decaying place but this theater remains a bright star. Saw Motown the Musical. Great cast, songs and lots of fun. However it was THREE hours long. Some folks walked before final curtain. Over",
          "We moved back to Buffalo after a long hiatus. We have season tickets to Shea's. We were at our 2nd performance and saw Motown. Outstanding musical if you like 60s & 70s music. Great interior and acoustics in Shea's. Seats are way too cramped. Worse than being in a middle airline",
          "I have never been disappointed when going to Shea's. The establishment is gorgeous. They try to bring the best Broadway performances to the stage.",

          "This historic theater is gorgeous! There are pay parking lots and garages nearby, within walking distance. Acoustics are great and you can see the stage from pretty much all over the theater. However, it was badly impossible to move around in the lobby before a show (we attended",
          "I would recommend going to any type of show at Shea's. The theatre itself is truly breath taking. There isn't a bad seat in the place. Get your tickets as early as possible if you plan on sitting somewhat close. One thing to consider is that there are lots and lots of stairs for",
          "Absolutely stunning venue, which features old world charm, historical character and very friendly staff. You can tell that the folks who work at Shea's take great pride in being part of one Buffalo's historical sites. We found the venue to be very classy and romantic. Shea's",
          "I've been to Shea's a few times. I've seen Wicked, The Book of Mormon, and Spamalot, and I can't wait until Phantom of the Opera comes through! I've seen traveling Broadway shows at other theaters throughout the country, but only in Chicago and NYC have I seen sets as",
          "Shea's in Buffalo has been renovated and is a beautiful theatre to visit and see a show. They cleaned the ceiling and installed LED lights. It's beautiful! It dates back to the 1920's and has an original restored Wurlitzer organ (restored). The shows are routinely sold out.",
          "We attended Mama Mia, and as always loved the experience. Its a clich\u00e9, but regarding the theater, they just don't make 'em like this any more. It's absolutely gorgeous and the continuing restoration is evident. To think that this jewel was once close to being torn . Thanks",
          "This is a beautiful venue with great acoustics. It's s great place to see a concert or a show. We sat in the lower balcony last time & those were great seats. The floor seats looked great too. Next time I'm going to try for them. Will definitely return. Tip: dinosaur barbeque",

          "Excellent facility, a Buffalo treasure, a must visit for adults and children, this was probably my fifth visit.",
          "Buffalo has the only naval park of this kind in the Great Lakes. The park has two ships and a submarine. An excellent family adventure. Parking is no problem. A wonderful place to visit and remember why we are free today.",
          "Located in the Buffalo waterfront, the park features three decommissioned World War II ships, a cruiser, destroyer and submarine. Allow at least 3 hours to walk through the ships. Outside one can find a plane, helicopter and other smaller vehicles. There\u2019s also a small indoor",
          "I've enjoyed Navel museums across the country and this was one of the best. The museum offers access to most of the ships. I particularly enjoyed walking through the engine rooms as this is not an area open to the public at most navel museums.",
          "I have visited this spot in Buffalo several times as parents sharing with our kids, years later as grandparents, with friends attending concerts. In all cases, it was time well spent. The tour of each vessel is worthy of your time, but that's especially true of the submarine.",
          "These types of ships are very interesting - but they do require mobility to climb up and down narrow spaces, in order to see the entire amazement of spaces. There is also a Submarine - to survey - but of no interest to me as below in the ship was confining enough!! Missed",
          "This is a beautiful tribute and remembrance of the men, women and machinery that served our country. It is all set against the background of the beautiful Buffalo waterfront. Great educational opportunity for young children but also a time to reflect for all ages.",

          "Really enjoyed it. Got a group on coupon and got to see the museum, tour 2 large ships and a submarine. We spent about 3 hours there and the kids enjoyed it. If anyone has mobility challenges I would discourage you from going as there are flights of steep steps",
          "Good trip back into naval tour of 2 diiffferent ships and 1 Sub. well worth the money for this area. Very frienly staff",
          "We are from San Diego Ca. And my husband and I have talked about this Trip to Buffalo. And Niagara. Falls for several. Years and it got canceled. more than once do to my husband being transfered for work, we are both Department of Defense employees and he is retired US Navy,",

          "Had a very unique business dinner on board the ships. We were able to do the self guided tours of the ship and the submarine. Very interesting to see how tight naval vessels are inside and how the soldiers would have had to work.",
          "Very interesting to walk through the old ships. Definitely worth the $15/each to walk through the ships. Meant for able-bodied folks\u2014-lots of narrow passageways and tough ladders. Plenty of restaurants and restrooms nearby for a lengthy walk up and down the boardwalk.",

          "I am a big military history buff and have gone and visited many related sites and museums. For the price (also look for a discount on Groupon) it is totally worth it to see the three boats, small museum, and the surrounding monuments and aircraft, etc.",
          "It is awesome, but what made it so good was our tour guide from the double decker bus tour. You can walk and look at how awesome the ships and planes are but when you have a guide that is so knowledgeable about everything there it\u2019s just better. Really enjoyed it",
          "I've driven by this naval park for years but it has always been while heading to/from somewhere. This time I planned a specific outing to visit the park. The ships are interesting, especially the guided missile cruiser as it was the first time I had been on one, but overall",

          "I'm a big fan of museum ships and the Buffalo Naval Park does not disappoint. They have 3 vessels to tour. If you follow the yellow line, you start on the destroyer USS Sullivans. I liked it the best. There seems to be more to tour and feels to be better preserved. Gun turrets,",
          "The museum is small, the ships are interesting. It\u2019s self guided, you follow the yellow arrows and the numbers on the brochure they supply let\u2019s you know what your looking at.

Of the two ships - the destroyer (named for the Sullivan brothers who died together while at sea during WWII, may they rest in honored peace) predates my experience in the early 1970\u2019s; while the light cruiser - as it",
          "Was here for a ceremony for the sub's 75th anniversary of it's christening, a very moving event. A full tour by one of the docents was just amazing. The various rooms and inside locations are full of original items just as they would have been in WWII. Great restaurant, Liberty",
          "Date of Visit: Saturday, April 6th, 2019 In addition to being a great place to walk and explore this is a great bit of military history, Honoring the military service women and men. You will enjoy a visit to this park, exploring the monuments, the artifacts, and the ships.",
          "Having an opportunity to visit these ships was fantastic. The Veterans on board were great and offered insights and stories. A great way to see and understand some of our naval history.",
          "Great place To visit. They offer a reduced entrance for veterans and seniors. Not for the unsteady on their feet going on and off the ships and through very narrow passageways requires good balance . An Easily spend a few hours here and they also have a small museum.",
          "For anyone who has an appreciation of history, your time is well worth going through the Ships and Museum. Incredibly interesting self-guided tour, kind of like Ikea, one way in and one way out. Just make sure you go to the bathroom before getting on the ships as there is no",
          "Very interesting to see this display. Unfortunately we didn't do the tour because it was closing in an hour and we didn't want to rush, but would recommend for sure . To see the history inside the museum was neat also. The location is beautiful also they are fixing up the",

          "Although the time of year we visited the visitor centre and tours were closed at the park, you were still able to walk about and see the ships and other military vehicles. A lovely walk along the canal and touching memorials in lovely gardens along the path, worth a visit.",
          "Even in the winter with no tours, it is still inspiring to be able to walk by and see these ships on display. There are plenty of memorials and dedications as well to read and be thankful for the people they represent, protecting our freedoms. I would really like to be able to",

          "Just walking on board the navy ships they have tied up brought back so many memories from my time in the navy. Right off the bat, a ship SMELLS like a ship. It took me right back to being a young 18 yr old on my ship. Then I saw a coffee mug with my ships logo on it in a display",
          "I received a membership to the museum when I moved to Buffalo- it was wonderful to be able to go a few different times in order to really go through all the ships/submarine. I highly recommend for families with kids over 5. You get to see it all here - working stations, mess",

          "Got to tour throughout the battleship and submarine. Spent a nice afternoon here. Great for anyone interested in the war, even for those that aren't. Enjoyed it very much.",
          "This is a great place to visit while in Buffalo. The costs are very good and the docents are helpful and knowledgeable. We were able to see how our sailors lived and sacrificed for our freedom. There is also a good museum and restaurant available. To see everything requires you",
          "Ships, submarine, fighters, SEAL submersible, monuments, this was such an unexpected surprise. Stayed at canal side hotel on biz and this was what I found on the am walk!",
          "Were able to tour 2 ships and one submarine as well as go through a small museum area. Staff was very helpful with questions and historical information.",
          "My husband and I frequent Canal Side during the summer. We took a drive down Memorial Day weekend and happened upon a very moving ceremony honoring our vets. It was in the lawn just across from the submarine. We did not tour any of the boats, as we have many times with the",
          "We took our time and explored the two Navy warships and a submarine. We got to see just about everything on the ships, above deck, below deck, and walked thru the submarine. It was our first experience aboard naval vessels, so it was great experience for us. We had some time to",
          "First of all I have a complete and new found respect for any military units who have to stay aboard a ship for more than a day or two. I have always respected our military men and women, but now after seeing how they had to love aboard these ships, it has only grown. If you get",
          "I play TAPS there for services and love the peace and tranquility and interesting sites. It is a casual, meaningful and easy to reach destination for individuals, small groups and especially families. Enjoy!",
          "A number of WWII era US Naval vessels on display The Sullivans, a destroyer. Also on display is the USS Little Rock, the only example I am aware of where you can see a Mk 7 missile launcher with weapon handling system afloat. Great example for those engineers out there aware",
          "This park is a wonderful tribute to the armed forces and the Navy. It is well kept, has a nice shaded walking path with small gardens and memorials. It is a busy place, but still relaxing and nice. Several ships, planes, etc. to look at and explore.",
          "We took a family with 5 adults and 4 kids (2 1/2 - 5 1/2). They liked exploring the ship but you need to know there's a lot of steep staircases, after all it's a naval ship. As long as you know your kids can do that you'll be fine. There are beautiful views of the city canal",
          "I have been to the pier/park a couple of times now. It is an historic preservation of our countries aquatic military presence. Our visit this time was to honor the fallen submarine military. There was a somber and moving ceremony with a choir, taps and the reading of the",
          "It good for military history buffs with a good variety of ships and a few planes. There is a small park with a bit of shade.",
          "We had several hours before a flight home. If you have the time, the ships are a real treat for anyone who served in the Navy (or just likes military ships). It's an easy drive from downtown Buffalo (and someone said the subway is free to Canalside). Take you time going up and",
          "I grew up in a household with a great appreciation for the contribution of the military (both past & present), so quite frankly I'm a little embarrassed it took so long to visit here, but this delayed visit proved to be a wonderful day for my sons and I. First of all, the",
          "This place is so cool. You not only get to see the cruiser and destroyer, but a submarine, patrol boats, fighter aircraft and more. There are a lot of veterans walking around, but this is a great place to take the kids as well. Lots of other memorials are set up around the area",
          "I like the small shady part next to the ships... on a hot day its necessary. lots of people where hanging out quietly. I did not go onto the boats, but I suspect kids would love it",
          "Fun place to explore - especially if you like history. Great tours and alot of stuff to do nearby at canalside.",
          "Came across this on the way to Niagara Falls. Looking for a place to get a coffee. Interesting area.",
          "This place is very nice an interesting a lot of history here, I believe you will need 2 hours to see it no more than that an them half an hour to walk outside the park an pictures",
          "Excellent museum and exhibition. Great learning facility for both youngsters and adults. This is the only inland museum of its kind, all others are in coastal areas. There are also a lot of other attractions within walking distance. Plan on a whole day. You won't be disappointed.",
          "Loads to see and do here if you love history. A couple of restaurants for lunch or a drink and great Lake Erie views!",
          "I've been trying to visit here for years! Unfortunately I couldn't stay long enough to soak up the whole experience. But what I was able to see was breathtaking! You never realize how big these ships are until you get up to them!",
          "You could easily spend 4 hours here if you looked at all the displays or, like me, you could skim the exhibits and just enjoy the chance to be aboard and see the ships and submarine which can still take 1-1.5 hours. My kids and I all had a great time!",
          "We loved loved loved this attraction. We would recommend this for all ages. There are some tight places on the ships so if you have any size to you it may be hard to get around. Overall a great attraction",
          "I enjoyed the visit to this site. It was filled with history. I did get tired before we finished the entire tour. Be prepared for lots of steps. Still, completely enjoyable.",
          "This venue consists of 2 naval ships and a submarine which you can tour from bow to stern. Everything is carefully marked so that you can take a self-guided tour at your own pace. Fascinating! There is also a museum to tour in a separate building, which offers a restaurant on",
          "The museum is great and worth the visit. Overnight encampment is not worth the time or money. The museum offers 3 naval vessels to tour; a sub, a destroyer, and a missile cruiser. The Cruiser is stock full of exhibits....almost to the point of overkill as a lot of the exhibits",
          "As a naval family we really enjoyed this experience. The park, trees, & flowers were beautiful & the monuments moving. The 3 ships were well preserved & the self guided tours were easy to follow including all parts of the ships & aspects of ship life. The two museums depicted",
          "Just had the MS walk down by the canalside.I grew up in Buffalo in one of the amazing places to actually go to, to think and see history and see beauty and once was a broke down downtown all we need now is a basketball team go Buffalo !! P.S awesome known as Love Canal",
          "Veterans and non-veterans alike will enjoy everything in the Military park. Everything is so well kept and clean. Much of the work is done by volunteers - giving back and honoring their service. Don't miss this amazing display.",
          "We went to the gift shop first looking for gifts for our kids. Since we had some extra time we decided to walk through the ships. Both were very interesting and we wished we had more time to walk through the submarine. Hopefully we will be able to visit again in the future.",
          "It's very interesting to be in these historic ships, also, you can learn a lot, you can see torpedos and missiles in the surrounding area.",
          "This is pretty cool. There is a lot of history packed into this museum and ships. You are able to go down into the ships and sub and a get a true appreciation for what our men and women troops go through to protect this great country. The self guided tour is pretty good. We",
          "WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS--see what it was actually like to walk in the shoes of the vets who fought for you--there is no experience like this ...",
          "We have had the opportunity to visit several naval ship museums. However, this one had 3 separate ships that were part of one tour. It was excellent to be able to see so many parts of the ship - all at our own pace. Love the way these ships were made available - just wish we",
          "This is a great way to spend an afternoon in Buffalo. Parking was relatively easy and you can enjoy the waterfront and Canalside. We ate lunch nearby and then boarded the ships and submarine. Very cool and the docents were really nice too. Be aware that there are steep steps",
          "A stop on our road trip and it was wonderful. Very educational and interesting. Plan on being a couple hours to really enjoy each museum. Very rich in history and was fun for everyone in the family.",
          "This museum is by far one of the finest museums Buffalo has to offer. The Sullivan's and the Little Rock both are beautifully maintained, preserved with history. From scullery to missile launch to the tiniest of barber shops, it sure was quite intriguing. Quite a fun workout. We",
          "Never thought I would have an opportunity to walk through navy ships and a submarine but I did. A highlight of my trip for sure",
          "Who knew downtown Buffalo was so cool? The ships in the River were amazing and quite a few of them too. The surrounding parks were clean and had many activities",
          "My main interest in going to the museum was to see the sail from the USS Boston since I served on board in the mid 90's. The museum upstairs was informative and organizedby the wars to make easy to take in without being overwhelming. The opportunity to go through through the",
          "We visited this excellent Naval and Military museum in 2016. Even my wife who did not like weaponry and war related exhibitions was amazed.",
          "Experience how our soldiers lived and fought during critical times in our nation's history. Walk though the cramped quarters of an actual submarine or the ship named after the five Sullivan boys who lost their lives fighting for our nation's freedom. The museum is a fine bonus.",
          "These ships are really a big part of our war history. A move was made about the 5 Sullivan boys who served on it and were killed which made a change in Military rules and regulations about how many sons from one family can serve in the services. By touring these ships, you",
          "This is one of the largest in-land naval parks in the country. You can visit two ships and a submarine, then go into the museum to see other artifacts. It was interesting learning about the ship's crews and their tours of duty. Be prepared for a lot of walking and steep stairs",
          "The Buffalo & Erie County Naval and Military Park offers a fantastic chance for residents and visitors to our area to tour several naval ships that helped protect our borders during WWII. There are many other wartime displays and monuments that document the service of many",
          "Recommend good walking shoes, comfortable clothes such as shorts on a hot day. The docents really know their stuff and well they should since they are all vets.",
          "Visit an exceptional site in downtown Buffalo. You will see how many of the military in several wars served their country. World War II, Korean Conflict, war in Vietnam, are all addressed. Other conflicts are treated with models and dioramas. Well worth the admission price.",
          "Love the Canalside with this piece of history stationed right at the harbor. Terrific choice for children to visit.",
          "Lots of fun exploring the ships. They say they are haunted, and it does feel spooky on it. It's right on Lake Erie and next to Canalfest, the new area they made up real nice. Also is the marina which is where I go for beautiful sunsets. Nothing more relaxing than sitting",
          "We have made a number of visits to Buffalo & Erie County Naval and Military Park. The park is in a beautiful setting adjacent to the Buffalo Waterfront's Canal Side attractions. There are very educational tours through the USS Sullivans and the submaraine USS Croaker and the",
          "Sometimes it's nice feeling like you are free to explore, like learning is a big adventure. There are so many different rooms for different purposes, it's truly amazing. Mind, I wouldn't like to get lost on either boat. Not that you would because there are signs and arrows",
          "I took my nephew when he was in town visiting. He is a military and history fanatic. It was a great sunny day in Buffalo and was well worth the price. You are pretty much on your own to walk around the various ships and some of the displays look rather dated and fading,",
          "While in Buffalo NY this is a must. It is a great piece of history, and the war POW and MIA is very touching.",
          "This park and museum is so unique and I was happy to visit. The ships on the deck are real navy ships served in the US navy at different times of history. This museum gives you a chance to get into them and discover different sections of these ships from the officers sleep",
          "My wife and I went by the Naval yard. Even though it was closed for the winter season I was in awe of the ships and submarine that were there. There is also a few smaller boats and fighter planes. Worth a look for anyone who like naval or machine viewing.",
          "The Military Park offers a variety of indoor and outdoor exhibits. The ships are great and require lots of walking and negotiating stairs. The is a circuit through the ship that is easy to follow and you can take all the time you need. The indoor exhibits offer a variety of",
          "Found the different exhibits very interesting despite the cold of January. We walked along the canal and were able to take plenty of photographs along the way.",
          "Great place to go on board the ship and a submarine! Been there numerous times with my grandson Jack .",
          "One of my most favorite places to take visitors to see in Buffalo. Great experience to explore the ship and the submarine. The military museum is filled with interesting exhibits.",
          "This attraction has grown tremendously over the years and has added tributes to veterans of our wars and conflicts. One of the few places you can walk aboard a sub a destroyer and a battleship. Very affordable as well. Lots of history.",
          "This was a great experience - much larger and more to see than what I thought. We took our three daughters aged 10, 13 and 15 and they all enjoyed it. Good history lesson!",
          "Was very interesting but we couldn't complete going through the ships as it got too cold. But what we did see gave you a good reminder of what people in the army go through. Once you step on the ship you can try to relive how they did during the war and see the conditions they",
          "Just to get up close to these historical ships and monuments is humbling - we were able to board the Edward Cotter the oldest working fire boat perhaps in the world when it was docked here for its 116 birthday - amazing experience - we have been on the Sullivan's many times. We",
          "This place is really cool, you get to tour the ship by your self. Its really awesome if you have a military family member who can relate. We went with our 3 kids. My husband got in free for being prior military. There is a lot of walking and climbing so if you are disabled it",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit in the Buffalo area. The waterfront is beautiful. The ships are so educational and beautiful. they do have many steps and tight spaces. But you can stay on top. Great for ages 5-95. My family loved it. perfect for out of town guests or",
          "There are self guided trails on and within each of the 3, a guided missile cruiser, a destroyer, and a submarine! In additiion there is a military museum and a nice waterside restaurant there, all just parts of Buffalo's rejuvenated and expanded Canalside area.",
          "Wasn't disappointed with the Museum. Great access around the ships and the submarine. Excellent in every way. A very humbling experience. We owe a tremendous debt to the brave men that fought in the World Wars. Many gave their lives for our freedom. Lest we forget.",
          "The Military Park is a beautiful area right next the waterfront and Buffalo River. It recognizes and HONORS all the branches of the services and all the wars. Beautiful ships that are manned by volunteers who take you on very informative tours.",
          "Yes, three in one place..... USS Little Rock, USS Croaker and the unforgettable USS The Sullivan's. Couldn't drag ourselves away from these ships, spent about 4-5 hours touring the vessels. Lots of history and stories of the brave men who served aboard. These ships are",
          "It was an amazing place, a lot of walking though, which is fine with us but not for my elderly father, he stayed at the hotel, good thing he would not have made it through the day. It's definitely all day thing, lots to see!",
          "We visited the entire \"Canalside\" area and enjoyed checking out the naval and military equipment on display.",
          "There's a battleship... a destroyer... a submarine... in another area they have a helicopter and other decommissioned military equipment. Nice family atmosphere. Kids will love it. \"Big Kids\" (meaning fathers and husbands and boyfriends and grandfathers) will love it. And just",
          "Earlier this year, my wife and I took her sister and Brother-in-law who were visiting from out of town, and her folks to visit the Naval Park. We had our won tour guide, my father-in-law, who was stationed on a sister ship of the Little Rock. There were tour guides there but",
          "History comes alive as you follow the self guided tour path that works its way thru a destroyer, guided missile cruiser and a submarine. You get a feel for what it was like to live and work aboard these vessels. Each is loaded with history, photos, memorably and fascinating",
          "Such a great place to go walk around on a nice day. You are on the water and seeing some awesome naval ships. The size of them is amazing. Kids would love this.",
          "The ships and sub are a great way to spend a relaxing few hours while soaking in History. I have done it a number of times and it never gets old. It is fascinating to see how theses war ships actually are - imagining how it was like to live and work on them - the sub especially",
          "As a US Navy veteran, seeing these ships brought back many memories--some good and some not so much. It was a treat seeing these warships and explaining various shipboard installations. A great piece of naval history and well worth seeing.",
          "Located a block a way from the Key Bank Center the Naval Park has Authentic Battleships and submarines available for tour and sleepovers. The ships and submarine were in actual use during actual wars. (Which ones im not sure) Also is located feet a way from a bar which is great",
          "We visit the Naval Park about once or twice a year with our kids and anyone else who wants to tag along. The ships hold much history as well as the growing museum that is along side ships on land. It takes a couple of hours to walk around and just enjoy the waterfront. Walking",
          "Anyone who enjoys history should not miss this! Visitors have the opportunity to board and explore not one but three WWII era ships - including one fierce looking submarine. A must for anyone interested in military/naval history, or the time period in general. The self-guided",
          "The museum building had plenty to look, a lot centered around events and people of Buffalo, but this is the Buffalo & Erie county museum. Getting to walk through WWII and Cold War warships were cool too. There were several displays through out the ships that showed other",
          "My husband and I did this on a whim but thoroughly enjoyed it. I definitely decided that it takes a special person to be able to enlist and live on one of these ships or a submarine. Not for me. But the self guided tour was very easy to follow.",
          "I spent about three hours here touring the ships. The tour is self guided following lines painted on the floor and reading signs at stops along the way. The rooms are preserved to give you a feeing of what life was like aboard these ships (one is a sub) during and after World",
          "Very nice. Scenic and historical. Great for families. Connectics to every age. Connects to Marina and Harbor.",

          "I have been to several exhibits that are similar to this one but few have had 3 vessels that were able to be toured. All were well maintained and very informative, the park itself was very nice",
          "We enjoyed our visit to both locations. Parking is a challenge, but there are plenty of activities to keep younger children occupied.",
          "I like museums: if they feature machinery, that's good. And if it's military equipment, so much the better. The Naval and Military Park in Buffalo satisfies those requirements, and does so for about the price of a movie ticket. This has to be one of the best museum values in the",
          "We were visiting Buffalo for the first time in 60 years, and my cousin wanted to show us how the waterfront was being redeveloped. I had never really thought of Buffalo as a port...but it certainly was! He drove us down to the water front and we walked up to the Naval Museum.",

          "My husband being a Navy man was pretty excited to see this when we arrived in downtown Buffalo. Although we were too late to take a tour on board the ships, they were docked close enough to get some good pictures and were able to see quite a bit. It was a nice moderate walking",

          "Went with a Navy Reunion Tour. Great Place Well informed tour guides. Toured three ships and ground displays. Nice museum and restaurant on site. A must for anyone interested in military. Tour covers most of the spaces in the Guided Missle Cruiser, Little Rock, USS SULLIVANS",
          "There is so much to see and take in! For you are from buffalo and get down to canalside I recommend getting a membership not only for support and upkeep but then you do not feel rushed you can come and go as you please exploring. Some rooms are small and can get crowded it",
          "Gotta be honest, the trip to Naval & Military park was really enjoyable. Thinking why I did not take this trip despite of spending countless years in cold Buffalo NY. If you enjoy history and prefer to learn more about Buffalo's roots, this place is for you! However, just",
          "I drive by these ships often on my way home from Buffalo. Finally, we made the time to buy a ticket and tour the ships. Touring, I learned so much about WWII. I was surprised at the tight quarters - especially in the submarine. I've always respected our servicemen and women,",

          "I was surprised at how much the Naval Museum offers for visitors. There are battle ships, submarine, and views of helicopter, PT boat, missiles, etc. There are also memorials to different wars and or military groups. Some boats you buy a ticket to visit and others you just walk",
          "A great place to introduce your children to the strength and legacy to America's Armed Forces. Tour the USS Sullivan, The Croaker and visit each monument that documents our participation in all wars, past and present. Surrounded by beautiful gardens, the park is serene and",
          "I just want to say how much I appreciated having my wedding ceremony here some years back. The people who ran the ship were very nice and accommodating to us. It was such a unique and fun place and made for some awesome pictures. It was a rainy summer, but we were under the",
          "For 12 bucks we thought why not, and what a walking tour that turned out be. Whoever devised the route was an evil genius of, um, military proportions. So how tough could it get just strolling through three vessels tethered to the shore? We had no idea the amazing sensory treat",
          "I'm speechless. This was an amazing sells guided tour through some of us most interesting naval vessels I've ever seen. You get a great appreciation of what our sailors went through while they were serving our country. If you are claustrophobic then the sub is not for you. I'm",
          "It was a big surprise the size of this tour. As we where spending the night in Buffalo, we decided to visit this park during the morning before we left. And it took more than 2 hours to go through all the incredible ships available for visit and the museum. It totally worth it!",
          "If you are into Navel History take this tour. Interesting how so many men lived in such cramped quarters. Try an go on a day that is not HOT outside, because while touring the ship it is very warm, so much so that we decided not to tour the submarine. All in all a great value",
          "We went here on an extremely hot day and clambered up and down all three ships. It is amazing the life that Navy sailors lived on these ships while at sea and during battles! It certainly would be a must-visit for anyone who has a Navy veteran in their family or for kids who",

          "A great visit and wonderful walk through the three Navy ships. Some great historical displays of major conflicts that we have been involved. It is a self-guided tour...just follow the yellow line. Some displays are interactive. It was great to see several Tin Can Sailors and",
          "Going here was a cool adventure. Being in a military family and a patriots i really appreciated what the park had to offer. The ships were amazing and i couldn't believe how much you could explore. The staff was great, prices reasonable, and tons of history. The kid's were blown",

          "One of the best collections of retired naval ships I have been to. The three different vessels that included a destroyer, a cruiser, and submarine, make the Buffalo Naval Park a must see destination when in Buffalo, NY. It gives you a true appreciation for those who have",
          "Great part of local history to share with the family! Kids are always surprised by the small quarters in the ship and submarine.",

        "wiki": "The Larkin Building was an early 20th century building. It was designed in 1903 by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1904-1906 for the Larkin Soap Company of Buffalo, New York.  The five story dark red brick building used pink tinted mortar and utilized steel frame construction. It was noted for many innovations, including air conditioning,  built-in desk furniture, and suspended toilet partitions and bowls. Though this was an office building, it still caught the essence of Frank Lloyd Wright's type of architecture. Sculptor Richard Bock provided ornamentation for the building.Located at 680 Seneca Street, the Larkin Building was demolished in 1950.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Larkin Soap Company was founded in Buffalo in 1875 by John D. Larkin. Among the principals were Larkin, Elbert Hubbard, and Darwin D. Martin.  By the early years of the twentieth century, the company expanded beyond soap manufacturing into groceries, dry goods, china, and furniture.  Larkin became a pioneering, national mail-order house with branch stores in Buffalo, New York City and Chicago.  Due to their growth, the company decided to expand its complex in Buffalo, New York in 1902.  At the time it commissioned its headquarters, Larkin was prosperous and the high price for a well-designed, innovative building was not a barrier.  The company, known for its generous corporate culture, also commissioned Wright to design row houses for its workers, which were never built.The first floor plan was of lobby and mail grouping, the second floor consisted of the typewriter operators' department, the third floor was the mail department, the fourth floor was the mail room, and the fifth floor consisted of a restaurant and kitchen, balconies, and a conservatory.\nA 100-rank M\u00f6ller pipe organ was housed in the central court with the pipe chambers located on the upper level and the console located in a shallow pit on the main floor.\n\n\n== Design ==\nExterior details of the 200-foot-long (61 m) by 134-foot-wide (41 m) building were executed in red sandstone; the entrance doors, windows, and skylights were of glass. Floors, stairs, doors, window sills, partitions, desk tops and plumbing slabs were used with   magnesite for sound absorption.  For floors, cement  was mixed with excelsior and poured, over a layer of felt to impart its resiliency.  Magnesite was also used for sculptural decoration on the piers surrounding the light court and for panels and beams around the executive offices at the south end of the main floor.  Wright designed much of the furniture, the chairs were made out of steel and hung from the tables to make cleaning the floors easy. The interior walls were made of semi-vitreous, hard, cream colored brick. A 76-foot-tall (23 m) light court was located in the center of the building which provided natural sunlight to all of the floors.  Between its support piers ran fourteen sets of three inspiration words each, such as: GENEROSITY ALTRUISM SACRIFICE, INTEGRITY LOYALTY FIDELITY, IMAGINATION JUDGEMENT INITIATIVE, INTELLIGENCE ENTHUSIASM CONTROL, CO-OPERATION ECONOMY INDUSTRY.\nArchitectural historian Vincent Scully, Jr. wrote of the structure: \n\nVertical brick piers and wall planes ... made possible the splendid integration of space, structure, and massing which Wright achieved in the Larkin Company Office Building at Buffalo, of 1904. In space the building was conceived of as facing inward, with a glass-roofed central hall rising the entire height and with horizontal office floors woven around it. The pattern of piers and walls which makes these spaces is clearly unified in both plan and section. The vertical piers rise uninterruptedly inside, and the horizontal planes of the office floors are kept back from their edges, so that they seem, once more, to be woven through them. ... At the same time, the stiff verticals of the interior of the Larkin Building continued to recall the challenge of the exterior, so that the occupant could not feel himself to be simply inside a shell. The sequence was an emotional one and a progress: challenge, bafflement, compression, search, and finally, surprise, release, transformation, and recall. It was almost a Baroque progression, but its methods were stiffer and harder, befitting the industrial program which they praised. Significantly enough, the building also recalled the Romantic-Classic projects of the first revolutionary architects of the later eighteenth century, particularly in the harshness of its forms but even in the rather underscaled world globes which were flaunted upon its exterior.\nWright said of the building: \n\nIt is interesting that I, an architect supposed to be concerned with the aesthetic sense of the building, should have invented the hung wall for the w.c. (easier to clean under), and adopted many other innovations like the glass door, steel furniture, air-conditioning and radiant or 'gravity heat'. Nearly every technological innovation used today was suggested in the Larkin Building in 1904.\n\n\n== Decline and demolition ==\nIn 1939 the Larkin Company made interior modifications and moved retail operations into the building.  In 1943, the firm's fortunes were in decline and it was forced to try to sell the building.The Larkin Administration Building was foreclosed upon for back taxes in 1945 by the city of Buffalo.  The city tried to sell the building over the next five years and considered other uses.  In 1949 the building was sold to the Western Trading Corporation, which announced plans to demolish it for a truck stop.  It did so in 1950 despite countrywide editorial protests; however, no truck stop was ever constructed.\n\nOn November 16, 1949, architect J. Stanley Sharp stated in the New York Herald-Tribune: As an architect, I share the concern of many others over the destruction of Frank Lloyd Wright's world-famous office building in Buffalo. It is not merely a matter of sentiment; from a practical standpoint this structure can function efficiently for centuries. Modern engineering has improved upon the lighting and ventilation systems Mr. Wright used, but that is hardly excuse enough to efface the work of the man who successfully pioneered in the solving of such problems. The Larkin Building set a precedent for many an office building we admire today and should be regarded not as an outmoded utilitarian structure but as a monument, if not to Mr. Wright's creative imagination, to the inventiveness of American design.\nThe destruction of all but one pillar of the Larkin Administration Building is tragic in the architecture community. Hopefully, in the future we will consider the value of a significant building such as this, and work to preserve it.\n\n\n== Fate of the site ==\nA single brick pier along a railroad embankment was one of the few features of Wright's original building that remained  after its demolition; the site became a parking lot with a marker and an illustrated educational panel.  In 2002, the Larkin Development Group began to acquire properties in the neighborhood, and revitalized the area over the next decade.In 2015, the new owners of the Administration Building site, The Larkin Center of Commerce, erected a \"ghost\" pier at the Seneca Street side of the wall that connected two of the fence piers. The ghost pier was built of etched glass the same size and location as the brick fence pier that once stood in its place. The ghost pier is supported on the concrete and stone base of the original construction. Inside the glass pier a small section of off white brick is visible. These are reclaimed bricks from the interior of the building. The sidewalks on Seneca Street reflect the locations of the major features of the building including the width of the atrium, fence piers and main entry. Granite markers inlaid in the sidewalk mark these locations. Two additional interpretive markers flank the ghost pier.\nExtensive Larkin Company records and photographs survive in the library collection of the Buffalo History Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Buffalo, New York\nLarkin Soap Company\nLarkin Terminal Warehouse\nLarkinville\nFrank Lloyd Wright\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nStorrer, William Allin.

        "wiki": "Amherst State Park is an 80-acre (0.32 km2) park in Erie County, New York, United States.  The park is located northeast of Buffalo, partially in the Village of Williamsville with the balance located in the Town of Amherst. The park is managed by the Town of Amherst under an agreement with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe property that now hosts the park was formerly part of the St. Mary of the Angels Convent, operated by the Sisters of St. Francis at that location since 1923. The convent was put up for sale in 1999.The property was acquired by the Town of Amherst and New York State in January 2000, after both entities evenly split the $5 million price to purchase the former convent and surrounding area. New York State owns 77 acres (0.31 km2) of the property while the Town of Amherst owns the remaining three acres (1.2 ha) of the park's lands. Under an agreement with the state, the town is responsible for managing the property for the purpose of conservation and to make space available for passive recreation.The convent's former motherhouse complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It was approved for sale by the town in November 2002, with the intent to allow development of a 102-unit senior housing facility, and is not included in the park. The facility opened in 2004.The area was formerly called \"Williamsville Glen\".\n\n\n== Park facilities ==\nAmherst State Park is located adjacent to Ellicott Creek, and features nature trails and biking trails that are open to the general public. Dogs are permitted, however they must be kept on a leash at all times. The main access point is at 400 Mill Street in Williamsville.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New York state parks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Black Rock, once an independent municipality, is now a neighborhood of the northwest section of the city of Buffalo, New York.  In the 1820s, Black Rock was the rival of Buffalo for the terminus of the Erie Canal, but Buffalo, with its larger harbor capacity and greater distance from the shores of Canada, a recent antagonist during the War of 1812, won the competition. Black Rock took its name from a large outcropping of black limestone along the Niagara River, which was blasted away in the early 1820s to make way for the canal.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn spite of losing the Erie Canal terminus to Buffalo and twice being burned to the ground by the British during the War of 1812, Black Rock continued to prosper. In 1814, a small group of American riflemen defended Black Rock and neighboring Buffalo from a British assault and, in 1839, it was incorporated as a town. In 1853, the City of Buffalo annexed the town of Black Rock.\nBecause of its strategic position across the Niagara River from Canada, Black Rock was an important crossing place for African-Americans escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad.  This heritage is celebrated with an annual Underground Railroad Re-Enactment at Broderick Park on Unity Island at Niagara and West Ferry Streets, the site of a ferry crossing prior to the construction of passenger bridges.\nThe area's first industry was shipbuilding, later supplanted by foundries, manufacturing, and canal commerce.  Today Black Rock boasts some pre-annexation houses and many excellent, often vacant examples of early 20th century brick and masonry industrial architecture.\nBlack Rock's history is amply documented in the library collections of the Buffalo History Museum.The Market Square Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\n\n\n=== Railroad link ===\nIn the 1870s, the International Railway Bridge connected the two nations at Black Rock, an engineering marvel at the time. The  Black Rock Rail Yard handled both passenger service and commercial transport of goods into and out of Canada.  Following the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the construction of the United States's Interstate Highway system, Canada's Queen Elizabeth Highway, and the increase of commercial air travel, the Black Rock Rail Yard lost its passenger service and later most of its commercial freight service.  The railroad bridge, however, remains in heavy usage and is one of the most important rail crossings between the United States and Canada.\n\n\n=== Prominent residents ===\nBlack Rock's best-known resident was American poet Robert Creeley, who lived with his family in a converted firehouse at the corner of Amherst and East Streets from 1990 to 2003. Another prominent resident was US Secretary of War Peter Buell Porter. Current residents include prominent Buffalo architect Max Willig who lives in the historic Amherst National Bank Building at the corner of Amherst and Germain Streets.\nFormer US Congressman John M. Holley lived in Black Rock.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeighborhoods of Buffalo, New York\nWalk-in-the-water (steamboat) -- Built in Black Rock\nBlack Rock Lock\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe map shown in the city data link http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Black-Rock-Buffalo-NY.html puts Rich Products Corp. not in Black Rock.\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlack Rock is covered in the  West Side travel guide from Wikivoyage.\n\nBlack Rock Historical Society\nBlack Rock & Riverside: A bibliography from The Buffalo History Museum",

        "wiki": "Fort Erie is a town on the Niagara River in the Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. It is directly across the river from Buffalo, New York and is the site of Old Fort Erie which played a prominent role in the War of 1812.\nFort Erie is one of Niagara's fastest growing communities, and has experienced a high level of residential and commercial development in the past few years. Garrison Road (Niagara Regional Road 3) is the town's commercial corridor, stretching east to west through Fort Erie.\nFort Erie is also home to other commercial core areas (Bridgeburg, Ridgeway, Stevensville and Crystal Beach) as a result of the 1970 amalgamation of Bertie Township and the village of Crystal Beach with Fort Erie.\nCrystal Beach Park occupied waterfront land at Crystal Beach, Ontario from 1888 until the park's closure in 1989. The beach is part of Fort Erie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the American Revolution Fort Erie was used as a supply depot for British troops. After the war the territory of what is now the Town of Fort Erie was settled by soldiers demobilised from Butler's Rangers, and the area was named Bertie Township in 1784.\nThe original fort, built in 1764, was located on the Niagara River's edge below the present fort. It served as a supply depot and a port for ships transporting merchandise, troops and passengers via Lake Erie to the Upper Great Lakes. The fort was damaged by winter storms and in 1803, plans were made for a new fort on the higher ground behind the original. It was larger and made of flintstone but was not quite finished at the start of the War of 1812.During the war, the Americans attacked Fort Erie twice in 1812, captured and abandoned it in 1813, and then recaptured it in 1814. The Americans held it for a time, breaking a prolonged British siege. Later they destroyed Fort Erie and returned to Buffalo in the winter of 1814.\n\nThe Fort Erie area became a major terminus for slaves using the Underground Railroad (between 1840 and 1860); many had crossed into Canada from Buffalo, New York. Bertie Hall (which was used for a time in the 20th century as a Doll House Museum) may have been a stopping point on the Underground Railroad. The area of Ridgemount was one of the three main areas in Fort Erie settled by African-Americans, earning it the name \"Little Africa\". Along with Little Africa, the other two areas of settlement were Bertie Hill and Snake Hill (Erie Beach).\nIn 1866, during the Fenian raids, between 1,000 and 1,500 Fenians crossed the Niagara River, occupied the town and demanded food and horses. The only payment they were able to offer was Fenian bonds; these were not acceptable to the citizens. The Fenians then cut the telegraph wires and tore up some railway tracks. Afterwards, they marched to Chippewa and the next day to Ridgeway where they fought the Battle of Ridgeway, a series of skirmishes with the Canadian militia. The Fenians then returned to Fort Erie and fought the Battle of Fort Erie, defeating the Canadian militia. Fearing British reinforcements, they then decided to retreat to the U.S.In 1869 the population was 1,000 and Fort Erie was served by the Grand Trunk and the Erie & Niagara railways. The Grand Trunk Railway built the International Railway Bridge in 1873, bringing about a new town, originally named Victoria and subsequently renamed to Bridgeburg, north of the original settlement of Fort Erie. By 1876, Ridgeway had an estimated population of 800, the village of Fort Erie has an estimated population of 1,200, and Victoria boasted three railway stations. By 1887, Stevensville had an estimated population of \"nearly 600\", Victoria of \"nearly 700\", Ridgeway of \"about 600\", and Fort Erie of \"about 4,000\".In 1888, the amusement park at Crystal Beach opened. From 1910, the steamship Canadiana (and until 1929, the steamship SS Americana) brought patrons from Buffalo until 1956. The park continued to operate until it closed in 1989. A gated community was built in this area.\n\nIn 1904, a group of speculators bought land at Erie Beach, planning to build an amusement park and other amenities, and sell lots around the park to vacationers from Buffalo. Erie Beach featured a hotel, a casino, a race track, regular ferry service from Buffalo and train service from the ferry dock in Fort Erie, and what was billed as the world's largest outdoor swimming pool. Erie Beach and Crystal Beach were in competition to provide bigger thrills to patrons, until Erie Beach went bankrupt during the Depression and closed down on Labour Day weekend, 1930.The Niagara Movement meeting was held at the Erie Beach Hotel in 1905. The movement later led to the founding of the NAACP.\nThe Point Abino Light Tower was built by the Canadian government in 1918. The lighthouse has been automated in 1989. Since its decommissioning in 1995, the Point Abino Lighthouse was designated as a National Historic Site. The lighthouse is now owned by the Town of Fort Erie and is available for weekend tours in the summer.\nOn August 7, 1927 the Peace Bridge was opened between Fort Erie and Buffalo.\nOn January 1, 1932, Bridgeburg and Fort Erie amalgamated into a single town.\nThe ruins of Fort Erie remained until they were rebuilt through a depression era \"work program\" project, as a tourist attraction. Work started in 1937, and the fort was opened to the public in 1939.\nIn 1970, the provincial government consolidated the various villages in what had been Bertie Township, including the then town of Fort Erie, into the present Town of Fort Erie.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFort Erie is generally flat, but there are low sand hills, varying in height from 2 to 15 metres (6.6 to 49.2 ft), along the shore of Lake Erie, and a limestone ridge extends from Point Abino to near Miller's Creek, giving Ridgeway its name. The soil is shallow, with a clay subsoil.\nThe town's beaches on Lake Erie, most notably Erie Beach, Crystal Beach and Bay Beach are considered the best in the area and draw many weekend visitors from the Toronto and Buffalo, New York areas. While summers are enjoyable, winters can occasionally be fierce, with many snowstorms, whiteouts and winds coming off Lake Erie.\n\n\n=== Communities ===\nIn addition to the primary urban core of Fort Erie, the town also contains the neighbourhoods of Black Creek, Bridgeburg/NorthEnd/Victoria, Crescent Park, Crystal Beach, Point Abino, Ridgeway, Snyder, and Stevensville.  Smaller and historical neighbourhoods include Amigari Downs, Bay Beach, Buffalo Heights, Douglastown, Edgewood Park, Erie Beach, Garrison Village, Mulgrave, Oakhill Forest, Ridgemount, Ridgewood, Rose Hill Estates, Thunder Bay, Walden, Wavecrest and Waverly Beach.\nFort Erie Secondary School and Ridgeway-Crystal Beach High School were two public high schools serving Fort Erie and area communities until September 2017.  The two former schools were closed and merged into Greater Fort Erie Secondary School, located on Garrison Road.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2016 Census of Canada indicated a population of 30,710 for Fort Erie, a 2.5% increase over the previous Census in 2011. The median household income in 2015 for Fort Erie was $60,800, which was below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nFort Erie Race Track\nOld Fort Erie\nPoint Abino Lighthouse\nSafari Niagara\n\n\n=== Hiking ===\nFort Erie is the Eastern terminus of the Friendship Trail, and the Southern terminus of the Niagara River Recreation Pathway. Both trails are part of the Trans-Canada Trail system.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nMather Arch Park, located just to the south of the Peace Bridge, is on land donated by American citizen Alonzo C. Mather in tribute to the peace and friendship between Canada and the United States. The park contains Mather Arch, which was built largely due to donations by Mather, originally dedicated by the Niagara Parks Commission in 1939, and restored in 2000 as a millennium project. There is also a memorial statue to those from Fort Erie who died in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Highways ====\nFort Erie has been the Niagara terminus of the Queen Elizabeth Way since 1937. Road traffic continues to Buffalo, New York across the Peace Bridge, which was built in 1927.\nFort Erie was the Eastern terminus of King's Highway 3A from 1927 to 1929, and Ontario Highway 3 from 1929 until 1998, when the portion of Highway 3 within Fort Erie was downloaded to the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Niagara Regional Road 3. Within Fort Erie, Highway 3 is named Garrison Road, and is the major East-West connection through the town. Dominion Road was designated as King's Highway 3C from 1934 until 1970, when it was downloaded to the newly formed Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Niagara Regional Road 1.\nFort Erie is the Southern Terminus of the Niagara Parkway, which extends from Fort Erie to Fort George.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transit is provided by Fort Erie Transit, which operate buses in town and connecting to other Niagara municipalities.Niagara Falls Transit operates a service from Niagara Falls into Fort Erie, connecting with the Fort Erie Leisureplex on Garrison Road.\n\n\n==== Intercity transit ====\nPrivate intercity coach services are primarily operated by Coach Canada and Greyhound, with connections to Hamilton and Toronto and to US destinations via Buffalo. The terminus is located at Robo Mart, 21 Princess Street at Waterloo Street.\nThe International Railway Bridge was built in 1873, and connects Fort Erie to Buffalo, New York across the Niagara River. There is currently no passenger rail service to Fort Erie.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nFort Erie is at the outlet of Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The lake and river serve as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft. There is a marina at the site of a former shipyard at Miller's Creek on the Niagara River, and a boat launch ramp in Crystal Beach.\nPrior to the completion of the two bridges, passengers and freight were carried across the river by ferry.\nFrom 1829, when the Welland Canal first opened, to 1833, when the cut was completed to Port Colborne, ship traffic between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario would transit the upper Niagara River.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nIn order to reduce large-scale ice blockage in the Niagara River, with resultant flooding, ice damage to docks and other waterfront structures, and blockage of the water intakes for the hydro-electric power plants at Niagara Falls, the New York Power Authority and Ontario Power Generation have jointly operated the Lake Erie-Niagara River Ice Boom since 1964. The boom is installed on December 16, or when the water temperature reaches 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F), whichever happens first. The boom is opened on April 1 unless there is more than 650 square kilometres (250 sq mi) of ice remaining in Eastern Lake Erie. When in place, the boom stretches 2,680 metres (8,790 ft) from the outer breakwall at Buffalo Harbor almost to the Canadian shore near the ruins of the pier at Erie Beach in Fort Erie. Originally, the boom was made of wooden timbers, but these have been replaced by steel pontoons.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nErnest Alexander Cruikshank, Brigadier General and historian; was born in Bertie Township.\nBilly Dea, professional hockey player, lived in Crystal Beach with his wife Sally and son Derrick for a large part of his professional career.\nMichael Fonfara, keyboard player; was born in Stevensville.\nPaul Gardner, professional hockey player; was born in Fort Erie.\nPaul Hellyer, engineer and politician.\nDouglas Kirkland, photographer.\nJames L.

        "wiki": "Charles Ephraim Burchfield (April 9, 1893 \u2013 January 10, 1967) was an American painter and visionary artist, known for his passionate watercolors of nature scenes and townscapes. The largest collection of Burchfield's paintings, archives and journals are in the collection of the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo. His paintings are in the collections of many major museums in the USA and have been the subject of exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Hammer Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, as well as other prominent institutions.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nBorn in Ashtabula, Ohio, Burchfield was raised by his widowed mother in Salem, Ohio. Most of his early works were done at this house, where he lived from the ages of five to 28, and which has since been converted into a museum. While he did think of being a nature writer in high school, he eventually focused entirely on the visual aspect of his creativity, writing short descriptive pieces for the painting on the back of the mount. Stimulated by the nature descriptions of others, his preferred American writers were Thoreau and Willa Cather and later he developed a passion for reading works by Finnish writers describing nature.Burchfield graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1916.  Later in life he acknowledged the profound effect on his own development by a teacher at the CIA, the artist Henry Keller. Keller led a generation of Ohio watercolor painters of the Cleveland School which included Burchfield.\nOn becoming engaged, Burchfield moved to Buffalo, New York in 1921, where he was employed as a designer at the H.M. Birge wallpaper company. The following year he married Bertha Kenreich in Greenford, Ohio. In 1928 with a fifth child on the way, he approached artist-gallerist Frank Rehn to see whether he could afford to paint full-time by selling through the Rehn gallery in New York. Though the decision to leave Birge preceded the Great Depression works continued to sell. In 1952, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1954.\nIn 1925, Burchfield had moved from Buffalo to the adjacent suburb of West Seneca, New York, spending the rest of his life in the rural neighborhood of Gardenville. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in the Village of East Aurora, New York.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nAccording to Burchfield's friend and colleague Edward Hopper, \"The work of Charles Burchfield is most decidedly founded, not on art, but on life, and the life that he knows and loves best.\"\nBurchfield has been more recently described as \"the mystic, cryptic painter of transcendental landscapes, trees with telekinetic halos, and haunted houses emanating ectoplasmic auras.\" Jerry Saltz suggests his influences as van Gogh, Caspar David Friedrich, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, \"calendar art, and Sunday painting.\" Like Hopper, he seemed to have left cubism out of the equation.\n\n\n== Process ==\nSince its heyday in the nineteenth century, watercolor had remained a popular style but Burchfield was unique among his major contemporaries for working exclusively within the medium. Unlike most watercolorists, he stood at an easel. He applied his colors with a \"dry brush\" technique (very little water) on machine-made paper, often reworking the surface during the process or sometimes many years later.Burchfield was an unflagging advocate for the virtues of watercolors, and chafed at the popular misconception of them as fragile and impermanent. He was aware that some fading and hue changes were likely to occur, but he believed that proper handling and display procedures would keep water-based artwork as vibrant as any other medium. Modern curators typically show watercolors like Burchfield's under reduced lighting and for shorter lengths of time than oil-based exhibitions.\n\n\n== Art periods ==\nHis work is usually divided into three periods comprising figuration, houses and small town scenes; and abstractions depicting moods (frequently morbid and fearful). Insect and frog sounds have their own calligraphic strokes, and cicada sounds are depicted with zigzag strokes radiating outward; flowers and houses seem to have faces, not always pleasant.\n\n\n=== Early Work ===\nBurchfield's style was largely developed by the summer of 1915, after his junior year at the Cleveland School of Art, as he sketched and painted constantly in and around Salem, OH, \"gathering the materials for a lifetime,\" according to his journals. Exposed in school to modernist European trends, he developed an almost fauvist use of broad areas of simplified color, enlivened by delightful particularizations of nature, and in 1917, began combining visual motifs projecting human moods, often disturbing, into the pictures. Assigned to the camouflage unit in the Army in 1918, he even worked his designs into painting schemes disguising tanks and artificial hills. Biographers note his exposure to modernist trends and traditional Chinese painting while in art school but overlook that the hallucinatory quality in his work may be partly traced to an episode of nervous exhaustion in 1911 while a junior in high school. Determined to record all the area's flowering plants that spring, he stayed up late at night painting whole bouquets of the blooms and had a bout of what was referred to at the time as \"brain fever,\" which might now be termed mania. He seems to have learned to use it as a source of energy and inspiration, and his school transcript records only three days' absence that semester. Painting constantly from 1915, even while working full-time in summer and after college, he sketched on walks to and from home at lunchtime and completed paintings based on them at night. Half of his lifetime output of paintings was produced while living in Salem from 1915 to 1917. The fact that so many paintings of this period were depictions of scenes visible from the windows of his boyhood home prompted Henry Adams, curator of drawings at the Cleveland Museum of Art, to call it \"the most important house in American art history.\"\n\n\n=== Middle Work ===\nIn his middle period, from 1919 until 1943, prompted partly by the need to provide financially for his new family with salable pictures for the New York art market, he depicted small-town and industrial scenes that put him in the category of the American Scene or Regionalist movement, and he was able to support himself through his painting from 1928, when he resigned his wallpaper design position at Birge & Co. in Buffalo, NY. These large paintings have a solid look unusual in watercolors, resembling oil paintings, and they are the works most often seen in art history texts. Though one critic commented that Burchfield was \"Edward Hopper on a rainy day,\" a 1936 Life Magazine article named him one of America's 10 greatest painters.\n\n\n=== Late Work ===\nIn his late period, from 1943 on, possibly facing a psychological crisis as he turned 50, he returned to the preoccupations of the early work, incorporating the painting skills he had mastered during his middle period (which he eventually saw as a \"diversion\" from his true path), and developed large, hallucinatory  renditions of nature captured in swirling strokes, heightened colors and exaggerated forms. In his writings he expressed an aim to depict an earlier era in the history of human consciousness when man saw gods and spirits in natural objects and forces, and art historian and critic John Canaday predicted in a 1966 review in The New York Times that the grandeur and power of these pictures would be Burchfield's enduring achievement.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe Charles Burchfield Center at Buffalo State College was dedicated in his honor in 1966. It was renamed The Burchfield Art Center in 1983 with an expanded mission to support a multi-arts focus. Between 1991 and 1994, the museum received a series of gifts from Charles Rand Penney, Ph. D., of more than 1,300 works by Western New York artists. Included in that gift were 183 works by Charles E. Burchfield. In honor of such a substantial donation the museum was again renamed as The Burchfield Penney Art Center.\n\nThe Charles E. Burchfield Nature & Art Center in West Seneca, New York is named in his honor. Developed in 1999, the 29 acre art and nature center complex also contains wild and cultivated gardens, a large playground, nature trails, playgrounds and an outdoor amphitheater alongside the banks of the Buffalo Creek.Of his current legacy, Saltz writes that \"Consciously or not, recent painters like Peter Doig, Verne Dawson, Gregory Amenoff, Kurt Lightner, and Ellen Altfest are channeling bits of Burchfield's visionary vibe.\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAmon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas\nBrauer Museum of Art, Valparaiso University\nBurchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo State College, Buffalo, New York.

          "Visiting cave of the winds and maid of the mist is something you cant miss after visiting niagara falls. To understand the massiveness and the force of the water its a must visit.\n\nCannot be missed",
          "Well maintained and excellent place to visit in niagara falls. When you go close to the falls the experience is unbelievable. The sound from the falls is so thrilling and not easy to forgot",
          "One of my favorite places to go now. The service was incredible and everyone there was very kind. I am definitely visiting here another time!",
          "Loved it! A very inexpensive education with truly breathtaking views and elaborate history that includes the a history that some rich and poeerful wanted forgotten out of greed. AC current is the future",
          "Beautiful! It was worth the price of the ticket to get down!",
          "UNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL!!!\nThis is a sight that you CAN'T MISS",
          "So glad we decided to visit here. I remember coming here 2 years ago and this experience was even greater than the last. Especially the water that falls on the stairs so that you can stand under the water.",
          "Great view,, had a wonderful experience by getting drenched in water",
          "This was an awesome experience.  We went in October the week of Columbus Day. There was no line and no waiting. It was a little chilly, but not horrible.  The view alone was worth it.  It was amazing to see the fall rushing down next to us \u2026",
          "This is crazy!!! Loved it!  Your almost in the waterfall!",
          "Was there last summer.Had a fun time especially going out on the hurricane deck..",
          "cool parts are.closed during winter. but the staff is kind enough to let you know exactly what to expect before buying the tickets. so cool.",
          "I'd have to agree that this is the one Niagara attraction you should do if you're only going to do one. Incredible experience and refreshing being down under the falls.",
          "A great attraction. No better view of the American Falls anywhere!",
          "My husband and I had our first trip over to the American side of Niagara Falls. What an Amazing time we had. This walk was beautiful . I thought Canada had the best .. but after being here America you have the best side. We had a lovely \u2026",
          "It was so fun, everyone was pleasant and nice! I am visiting from New York! And I\u2019m going to recommend all my friends to come here! I did the Discovery tour and our tour guide CAT! Was amazing, funny and nice!",
          "What an amazing experience! We came to Niagara for my birthday celebrations. We did get the attractions pass. It is so worth it. No need to wear makeup if you go to the Cave of the winds. Don\u2019t waste your time ladies. Expect to get wet! The \u2026",
          "The best place to visit in Niagara falls. This is the closes place u can get to the falls. The hurricane point is absolutely mind blowing and terrifying. U will have to climb a lot of stairs. The stairs are sturdy and well maintained. U \u2026",
          "It is so beautiful here! The tour guides were very friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely coming back!",
          "You will have amazing experience here.. Water drops from fall will push you forward after its first hit on the rock, it is safe. We can also take kids near the water fall. Would like to spend lot of time here..",
          "If you have problems walking up or down steps don't do it!!!! Otherwise this is truly magic. Bridal Veil lands right on top of you from the Hurricane Deck. It is truly a wonder to see. It is AMAZING to feel 60,000 gallons per second. The \u2026",
          "Most amazing experience ever!  Warning...you will get soaked even with the poncho on.  It was so beautiful with rainbows and wildflowers everywhere.   The power of the water rushing down next to you is indescribable!  If you have to choose \u2026",
          "Spectacular view! The falls were beyond beautiful and the film before the tour was very informative. #reedsontheroad #onefamilyoneyearfiftystates",
          "This is by far my most favorite thing to do while visiting Niagara falls. I enjoy this experience more than going on the boat. It is a lot of walking but many good places to take pictures and walk at your own pace and enjoy the area. The \u2026",
          "Such a fun walk!  A must do if you go to Niagara Falls!   There really is no caves but there is a lot of water and a lot of wind!\n\nThey give you panchos and sandals.  They do a good job of keeping you dry.  However you can also get absolutely soaked if you want.  And that is most of the fun!",
          "Pretty cool! I personally liked the Hornblower better. Both were fun. You get free sandals here because you get SO WET. Fun experience.",
          "Get up close to the Falls and experience the force of the water. Really, really cool.  Even though you get a poncho and sandals, you will get wet, which is part of the fun. Wear shorts unless you don't mind wet pants. Beautiful views of the gorge and Horseshoe Falls. A definitive must do!",
          "It\u2019a great place to see the falls from and is completely different in the winter time. Would highly recommend if open.",
          "This is by far the best attraction in Niagara Falls for both American and Canadian side.  The views are extreme impressive and it\u2019s the closest you can get to the falls.  Actually, you are in the falls.  Come prepared to get soak, you have \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to visit although it was very cold when I went place has great views, will deffinetly have to make another trip during the summer.",
          "Amazing experience. As a Canadian, I live the view from the Canada side, but the US Niagara Falls park is so much nicer in my opinion than the carnival atmosphere on the  Canadian side. My family loved getting soaked in the Cave of the Winds! Bring a second change of clothes and get totally drenched in Niagara!",
          "One of the best experiences ever! Would rate it much higher than the maid of the mist experience. Must must do!! We did it twice in two days. Kids absolutely loved it!! Without this experience you have not truly appreciated Niagara Falls from USA side!",
          "It was great experience to see the falls very near and we feel the power of water ..the walkway is thrilling experience..wind is very strong and they gave yellow raincoats but we ended up full wet..definitely a must go place..",
          "Just beautiful  my family  from out of town loved it !!!",
          "Amazing experience. Though it would be much more comforting if it was built on something stronger than a bunch of 2\u00d74's wedged between rocks considering one of the most powerful forces of nature is barreling down right above you. Definitely gets your heart pumping!",
          "Cave of the Winds was impressive for sure. Having the chance to walk right next to the waterfall and stay below it is for sure a must do while at Niagara. Be careful, you\u2019ll get really really wet, but it\u2019s worth it for sure. I\u2019d recommend \u2026",
          "Cave of the wind in Niagara Falls state park is amazing.. wonderful experience.. it is the one of the wonderful place to go with kids and family.. All enjoyed a lot here.. Staffs are good.. I would recommend to getting your tickets earlier \u2026",
          "Breathtaking view!  Very much worth the cost.  The hurricane deck was a must--just to say you did it. :)  Took dozens of great shots that you couldn't possibly get otherwise.  Plan to get wet--especially if you do it right!",
          "This place is absolutely AMAZING & a MUST DO if you\u2019re coming to the falls! FYI there is steps to walk up/down to get the best experience. My favorite part was the \u201churricane deck\u201d & it was so amazing to be that up and close to the falls!",
          "So fun. Whether you are local or a first time visitor, this attraction is a must! \nMy advice is to bring a change of clothes so you can dry off and change if you aren't heading home right afterwards because you will get very wet. \nIt is so much fun but involves a lot of walking and a lot of stairs, so make sure you are prepared!",
          "Absolutely amazing to be that close to the Falls! It was literally breathtaking when the water hits you! Niagara Falls has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember so we were thrilled to finally have an opportunity to see it! We bought the passes to do 5 different things and it was worth every penny!",
          "Good to experience US side of Niagara. Timed entry. So no huge rush like in Maid of the mist. \nBe prepared to get wet. Raincoats will not save much.\nThey provide slippers. But you will have to carry all your belongings with you all the trip. So better go empty hand.",
          "The staff was kind, but I don't know how much they are sanitation wise.",
          "Niagara trip is incomplete without visiting Cave of the Winds. It's a wooden staircase to one of Niagara falls. This is best place to feel Niagara closely. It feels like heaven here. \n\nNote: Local managing authority (very supportive) gives \u2026",
          "This is such a great experience located on the us side. I would recommend getting your tickets earlier in the day as spots fill up. They give you sandals to wear and a poncho. The best part is the hurricane deck that has you inches from the falls as water and mist surround you. This should be a must for anyone visiting the falls",
          "Some of the best fun I\u2019ve had in a long time . One of those places where you just have to experience to truly take in all the beauty and love that this place provides . Please experience this and don\u2019t even question or worry about wether it will even be worth it . Carful with your shoes though . They will get wet",
          "Watch the gushing water upclose. Make sure to protect your camera",
          "Got to be at the base ofthe fall for about 15 mins, very beautiful to see during the off season",
          "Very fun!!! Had a great family day!",
          "No photography can explain the experience which one can have only by being there and feel the power of massive force of nature in the form of water falls. No amount of explaining or description can match the first hand experience. If one is visiting this area it is a must visit place.",
          "They take you down an elevator towards the bottow of the american falls great view",
          "Amazing experience. So much fun! A must do if you\u2019re visiting on a sunny day. The park provides free sandals, so don\u2019t worry about your shoes.",
          "Kids loved standing practically under the waterfall and feeling the power of a category 1 hurricane. It was one of the hottest days in NY, and they took full advantage! \n\nBreathtaking views of the falls from below.",
          "Very disappointing experience. There is not much to see at all except a crowded tunnel where groups of 25+ people block the way to water flowing at the end of the tunnel. Not that you can get any real view or sense of scale of the falls. I would skip this one and choose a different experience.",
          "Great experience. Recommend waterproof covers for phones. I would not recommend professional style cameras. Be prepared to get soaked.",
          "It was so-so. I expected it to be an actual cave where you view a piece of the falls but it is actually a cave that leads you out to a wooden cat-walk where you can get up close and personal with a little piece of part of one of the little falls. it WAS a great place for photos and videos provided you have a waterproof camera.",
          "Fun but very wet. Roll up your pants and hide your bag under the plastic poncho cause the stairs are right by the falls and you'll be walking in water and get a good splash. Too bad they don't have lockers to leave tour bags in anymore.",
          "You can actually feel american waterfall here. We can rate this as 2nd must visit attraction with first being Maid of the mist boat ride.\nThere is elevator that takes you down to the cave of winds. They have nicely constructed wooden \u2026",
          "So beautiful.  If you\u2019re limited on time in the area, this is one of the things I recommend you make a priority to do.  You won\u2019t regret it. It is breathtaking.",
          "Getting up close to the falls from below was exhilarating.  The sheer power and also the mist was great on a hot day.   However, the unexpected presence of millions of seagulls (and their excrement) did little to diminish the experience but beware of that bothers you...",
          "Very awesome experience! I was a bit worried about my 2 year old getting scared but everything went smoothly. Make sure to take a waterproof camera to capture better moments and waterproof makeup.",
          "Parking is huge and costs 10$. Nice views and great service. Cave and Boat adventures about 20$ per adult. They will provide you with raincoat and shoes!",
          "Although I was there in the closing week of the falls, we could access a little part of the staircase close to the falls but still it was fun. Was lucky to capture the rainbow also.",
          "An absolutely beautiful, wonderful, unforgettable experience.\n\nGo on a hot day, you go under the actual falls and the feeling makes everyone from the smallest child to the elderly have the same reaction. \n\nWill make you shout in amazent and \u2026",
          "Cave of the Winds in Niagara Falls is a beautiful experience I have ever had. You can spend 1-2 hour here and experience the real below the fall experience specially on the hurricane deck. Staffs are very nice and helpful. I would recommend \u2026",
          "My #1 favorite attraction on our Niagara Falls trip.  DO NOT MISS THIS.  \n\nWe stayed on the Canadian side and walked over to NY to come to Cave of the Winds and I couldn't be happier that we went that extra effort.  \n\nThis attraction puts you as close to the falls as possible - where you can feel the immensity and power of the falls.",
          "The employees were very hospitable. The Experience itself was very enlightening, thrilling, and fun! The shoes that come with the ticket price are very useful. Get ready to get wet and get blown!",
          "Beautiful. They give out shoes and ponchos with admission. Be prepared to get wet. Lines are long but view is beautiful. They have a short fil you watch which is interesting",
          "The best experience we ever had in recent times. It\u2019s was mesmerizing and wonderful. Such an elegant view and breathtaking ride. Would definitely recommend to visit this place when the temperature are ideally between 64-70F. Late Spring would be the best time.",
          "Although i love this attraction, they are terribly understaffed in the winter.  This lead to confusion for my group, as well as another group.",
          "This gets you up close to Niagara Falls, you can get as wet as you want or stay fairly dry depending on how adventurous you want to be.   My nephew stood on the hurricane deck and wanted to get drenched, but I was able to stand back a little and not get very wet.   It was an exhilarating experience!!",
          "An absolute must. The hurricane deck is such a unique experience and getting to shower in the falls is an experience like no other. They give you sandals and a poncho because you will get wet. The sandals are recyclable or you can keep them. It is a very nice feature.",
          "\u201cmust go\u201d\nYou will get a real feel of Niagara and also can touch or take shower in waterfall  - that\u2019s amazing",
          "Absolutely our favorite stop on our vacation! So cool and fun and awe inspiring. If you have a chance to go I highly recommend it.",
          "I don\u2019t think people understand how magnificent this experience can be just from the pictures, not matter how good they might be. Being under the waterfalls it\u2019s just magical, I felt in loved with environmental tourism after this. The feeling is hard to describe but it is 100% something that you need to do!",
          "It is an exciting activity in Niagara falls state park. However, it is not worth the hype. The falls state park prepare you a hell lot just to go and take a look at the smallest of the falls. The whole experience can be summarised as \u2026",
          "This costs $19 per person.  You get flip flops and a poncho to use and  as much time as you  want.  It is so exciting.  You won't be  disappointed.  Be prepared  to get wet though.",
          "SO WORTH IT. The time-stamp tickets can be a drag if you're not expecting to have to wait but there are plenty of things to do while you wait for your group. The park is beautiful and the history you can learn just walking down to the boardwalk was super interesting and fun.",
          "Awesome experience, especially the hurricane deck. You will get a feeling for the Niagara Falls and how big and powerful they actually are.\nIt can get really wet and if you want to take photos bring a waterproof camera. If it's a bit windy \u2026",
          "A must do on your visit to Niagara. Feeling the force of the water at the bottom is just amazing. Being able to see the falls from the bottom and the top is very very cool!!",
          "Amazing any time of year but winter adds a whole new level of awesome.",
          "Awe-inspiring view of the American falls. Show up early to get in before the crowds. You can choose not to go onto the hurricanes deck. Water shoes and ponchos are provided, however going onto the hurricane deck will still get you drenched so bring a change of clothes.",
          "Amazing experience. It fills like you are standing right under the waterfall. And also can get some water splash on \"the hurricane deck\". Strong natural energy\u26a1",
          "Staff is great Park is beutiful and well kept.The tour is well organized. The prices at the gift shop were a bit high. (Compared to other gift shops) but that is my only complaint. I suggest getting the discovery pass and enjoy everything.",
          "Lots of fun and water and wind. Your are right down inches from the falls. Get really wet. But there was no cave.  Not sure why they call it cave of the winds. It should be called Wooden Catwalk of the water. But that doesn't roll off the tongue. 4/5 stars would get soaked with random strangers again.",
          "very much worth the experience for those that have no trouble with moderate stairs.  excellent for experiencing the power of the falls and the size of it all.  thru this, you'll walk near the base of the falls.  elevator takes you to a lower level and the moderate stairs begin once lower and off the elevator.  excellent.",
          "Totally worth it, the view is amazing and you get extemely close to the falls. Its a bit of walking but it's not bad at all and the shoes they give you are very comfy and once you get to the top its the best part. The only problem is that the line to get back up is super long",
          "It's a amazing experience. You can feel and touch the Niagra falls. You can see rainbow and feel the wind with water. I never forget each and every moment I experienced from there.",
          "If u go to see the Falls & can take the steps (up & down). This is must visit spot, especially the Hurricane Deck.\n1. Please watch your step \n2. Share the space & be courteous with other visitors\n3. Respect the nature!",
          "When I asked people about Niagara Falls I heard.... go to the Canada side!! \n\nIf someone asked me?? USA all the way. Waste your money over there n see what\u2019s good here. What a difference I\u2019m so glad I checked this place out. It\u2019s the right way to experience Niagara Falls.",
          "Super fun, be ready to get really wet!! Even with a poncho on (legs only in this case). \nPS: Standing on the top with your back facing the falls = awesome back massage . 10/10 would recommend",
          "Beautiful place especially when one stands below the fall and experience the full force of water..",
          "Must visit place. Enjoyed a lot with family. Every penny is worth spending at Niagara Falls park. Maid of the Mist is a plus.",
          "This was a stop on our fall colors trip. Everyone should see the falls at least once in a lifetime.",
          "Cave of the Winds is amazing! As a local to the area I had never been but I am so glad I went!\nDefinitely brave out the Hurricane Deck....closest you can get to Niagara Falls!\n\nFun fact: the walkways you use for this (see pics) are torn down at the end of every season and rebuilt at the beginning of the next season!",
          "Great place for a family. Beautiful as well as breath taking.",
          "Probably one of the cooler things I did during my stay here. Would definitely recommend doing it.",
          "It was so exhilarating to get so close to Bridal Veil Falls. We stayed pretty dry even standing in the hurricane part of the walk. Would do it again.",
          "It was such a awesome experience!! Great staff!!",
          "Want to enjoy the gushing thunder of millions of gallons of water falling every second right next you? Come to the Cave of the winds for an unique experience, dancing colorful lights and fantastic fireworks and memorable show.",
          "An experience like no other. Very safe and organized. Souvenir sandals and bags to keep the things that you want to keep dry. You go right next to the water fall. See lots of birds, great photos.",
          "Cave of the winds was a breathing taking site.They give you free ponchos,bags,and shoes that you can keep for free.The top was just enough excitement so that it wasn't to  scary. I ordered an ice cream at perrys and it was very good,portions were very large.They also had a selection of food.I recommend it.",
          "Worth every penny. Amazing experience. Remember to roll up your pants, you're gonna get wet!",
          "I loved it! You basically get under the falls. Amazing. Cave is a bit deceptive though.. and you get extremely wet.",
          "Great place to get up close and feel the falls. Would also recommend the crows nest, if it's open.",
          "Lots of fun and water and wind. Your are right down inches from the falls. Get really wet. But there was no cave.  Not sure why they call it cave of the winds. It should be called Wooden Catwalk of the water. But that doesn't roll off the tongue. 4/5 stars would get soaked with random strangers again.",
          "This was a great experience. You first watch a short movie to learn the history of the falls. Then you take the elevator to the bottom of the falls. They give you a poncho and free cheap but comfy sandals to help keep you a little dryer. Be prepared to get wet but it is definitely a must while at the falls.",
          "You HAVE to do this! It\u2019s such an adventure!!! You will get soaked. Plan accordingly. They give you flip flops and a poncho but if you\u2019re doing it right, you will be totally soaked. The movie they show you beforehand is really informative and well done.",
          "A must-do activity if you plan to visit Niagara Falls. The activity includes a rain coat and sandals that you can recycle or keep as a souvenir. The view of the seagulls nests and the falls is just breathtaking. I recommend this activity 100% \ud83d\ude0d",
          "There is no experience like this!!! Definitely a must see when visiting Niagara Falls, USA!!! You're given ponchos and sandals and breathtaking views! The hurricane deck was amazing so be brave!! You can get right up to the water, it's cold but worth every second!!",
          "View is amazing but they are worst at providing information. If they can\u2019t tell clearly what to do after buying the tickets they should add the details on tickets at least. We bought tickets at around 1.15 pm. Lady said 1.30 group is full \u2026",
          "Very organized, they sell tickets for time, we got to the park at 11 AM the group they were selling was for 248 P.M. group, which was good cause we could make time walking around and having lunch and some drinks in the restaurant at the \u2026",
          "Where to start? This place is amazing and then some.  You will leave in awe of this place.  It is truly a religious experience on its own.  The raw unbridled power of the falsies truly a sight to behold. Fair warning.  You will get wet even \u2026",
          "One of the best places to visit in almost all of the United States. Had a good time in getting mesmerized with Nature beauty of the falls. Had a good time in hurricane deck.",
          "It is a one of a kind experience. Don't bring anything valuable, I put my glasses in my sweatshirt for 'safekeeping.' My glasses are now forever one with the falls because I don't think they are biodegradable \ud83d\ude02.",
          "This is an awesome family friendly experience  that allows you to get up close to the falls and gage the actual power coming from those falls. Highly recommend! Plan to be real wet when your finished!",
          "Omg I loved this with the water in your face and up so near the water. The lines were not bad considering there are only two elevators taking people up and down. Also the photo package was so worth the price. Highly recommend the adventure.",
          "Great experience!! Much better than I had hoped for!! These waterfalls are impressive!!",
          "It's worth the trip! I have been here 3 times and will come back here. The fall is gorgeous",
          "This is a must do experience. There is a seagull problem just after you come out of tunnel but it's a great experience after that. The steps have very firm grip and good support for elderly people to climb. Really enjoyed the water falling on us.",
          "you can look the rainbow any time. \ndon't loss this attractive moment with the rainbow around you for take the picture",
          "Amazing place to visit . Mind you I visited this place in mid February so its was still very cold and frozen over, but based on what I was able to see it was very spectacular and and excellent experience I can only imagine how nice it would \u2026",
          "So much fun. U get up close and personal with the falls. you will get wet!! It was awesome. A must do.",
          "Beautiful place. Enjoyyyyed the force of water. And witnessed the beauty of nature. The place is so nicely maintained. Very safe. A must...",
          "Far more intense than expected.  You get right up to the base of the rocky churn and the hurricane platform engolfs you in the curtain of high velocity water.  You can control how close you get but not for the timid.  People brought very young ones which I would not recommended.  My 6 year old was probably too young.",
          "5 stars if you go in the daylight. Went at night and the falls were awesome illuminated... but the walkways and platforms were dark as well as wet with steep stairs. Very dangerous. Not much can be done about wet and steep but strip lighting under the rails is an easy no brainer fix for the dark.",
          "Speechless \ud83d\ude09 The most visited place on Earth \ud83d\ude00 awesome experience",
          "Cave of the winds takes you go beyond the brink and get closer to the Falls than you ever imagined . You can also view and experience the history of the Falls at the  indoor multimedia booth.",
          "Amazing experience! Definitely recommend it as you get an extremely close look at the falls. Not to mention, the wind, water, and scenery is super fun! Worth the money, just don't be afraid to get wet!",
          "Great place, Great experience.   Was here on a very busy Saturday.  Very important to schedule a time at the ticket booth,  once a time is scheduled just show up then and almost no waiting to get in.",
          "If you're visiting Niagara Fall it's a must that you visit Cave of the Winds! First the up front view of the fall is amazing and very awe inspiring. Not only are you able to see the amazing sight of nature you're also able to touch the fall \u2026",
          "It feels amazing to be there very close to the falls. The feeling was beyond amazing. Poncho and sandal came with the ticket. If you can I would suggest not to wear full pants because you gonna get soaked in there even wearing the poncho",
          "Great place to experience the power of the water fall and get up close to it. Our 3.5 yr old loved it and would definitely want to go again.",
          "A must see attraction when visiting Niagara falls. Keep in mind that you will get wet whether or not you carry the poncho provided by the park service. The only way to avoid that would be to carry your own.\nThe falls are beautiful and \u2026",
          "Amazing experience to feel the waterfall. If you do, you will get wet. Be prepared. Come early for tickets or get them online",
          "5 stars plus. So much fun, amazing views and much, much better than Journey Behind the Falls in Canada. Loved it!",
          "Lots of fun and great views. Much better than Canadian side \"walk behind the fall\".  Harricane deck is great experience but expect to get really wet if you step on it.",
          "Beautiful way to see the falls. You get up close to the Bridal veil! Such a cool experience! But warning you will get wet!!",
          "Great views!  Things to keep in mind:\n\n- The entrance cost (as of today) was $19\n- They will provide you a poncho and sandals \n- You will he given a plastic bag to put your shoes but you will have to carry it around with you",
          "Outstanding!!! I knew about the Maid of the Mist but this is just as amazing! Especially great to cool off for hot day! They will provide you with ponchos and sandels.",
          "Really cool place. It's fun to learn the history of the falls. The hurricane deck is the best part, you just have to try it!",
          "Visited in winter and it was still worth the trip. Staff were informative and friendly and this view of the Falls was brilliant.",
          "It is a MUST SEE place if you have ever have a chance. We went there after the summer and it was an amazing view. The whole waterfall is viewable from top to bottom. You will hear roar of the waterfall and see the mist. Make sure you collect the plastic raincoats and slippers to use there.",
          "Prepare to get wet. Enjoyed it in the summer.",
          "It's a good opportunity to understand the scale and might of the Falls from up close. They provide you with a rain coat, which does the job but could be better. Your shoes and lower body would get drenched in water for sure, so do not wear expensive shoes. Would have been nice if they gave slippers.",
          "It's the best attraction of Niagara Falls... do not miss it... it's totally worth the time and money... it's amazing you get to go up and close to the falls and experience the sheer energy of the falls for yourself... it's amazing!",
          "Great experience seeing the falls and getting help and conversations with the male staff!! For some reason(s), all the female employees including the ticket booth person were rude with one word answers and commands...what happened that \u2026",
          "I wasn't expecting such an educational walk through. The falls were great don't get me wrong but it was a great price just for the education I received about the falls. Would recommend. The parking was a bit pricey though at 10 dollars.",
          "So worth it!  This was absolutely, hands down, the best part of our Niagara Falls trip! Yes there are quite a few stairs, but lots of platforms or decks to stop, get pictures, and rest a bit between staircases if you need to. Walking \u2026",
          "You don't get to go in the cave anymore. So, for $20, you get to walk the boardwalk at the bottom of the Falls. Still an amazing experience,  but they should call it hurricane walkway, not cave of the winds.",
          "This is my personal favorite. It\u2019s a great feeling standing beneath a giants waterfall.\nThe queue can be longer for the elevator. Short movie telling about the history is interesting as well.",
          "Such a great time with my family today. A cheap and enjoyable time under the awesome Niagara Falls. The Hurricane Deck was great fun and the laughter and smiles from the other tourists was worth watching as well. Groovy :) sandals (which \u2026",
          "Great up close and personal look at the falls on the American side.",
          "Just went yesterday best experience in my life!. Hurricane deck rocks! ....don't wear anything you don't want to get wet..also bring protection for your phone",
          "Had a great time with the family here while on vacation. The falls are amazing and you get super close at cave of the winds. Kids loved it.",
          "Really amazing. The force of the winds is strong. Prepare to get wet",
          "A really cool experience. We went in April and they were tearing down and building a new walkway down at the bottom of the falls so we couldn't go out as far but still a very neat tour. Our tour guide could have done a much better job of engaging and telling the story.",
          "So much fun. The hurricane deck was a blast. Great price for the group of things to do.",
          "The ONLY good tourist location on the American side of the falls. You literally get hit with the water from the waterfall. My husband and I spend over and hour walking around on the plate forms taking pictures, video, and enjoying the experience as well as pure power of Niagra Falls.",
          "Loved it. The kids were so into it, and why not. The hurricane deck was so cool. Literally and figuratively - getting blasted by water from the falls was the highlight. Tons of baby  gulls hatching on the rocks was amazing to see as well. Not sure if that happens all summer or just early on. We visited on labor day.",
          "Marvelous, fun, exciting, very cold but loving the water splash from the waterfall.",
          "Oh. My. God. It is incredible!! This experience is one we will never forget. Worth the lines and every penny it costs. So glad we spent the day here on the US side. People told us just to go to the Canadian side but now I know you gotta do the Cave of the Winds.",
          "Very cool place, but dont go in December when its 23 degrees",
          "Only was able to go partially down due to the time of year but it was AMAZING experience!",
          "Prepare you will get very wet.... but no better place to experience the power of the falls.... it's the littlest of the three, but when you experience it ,,,,,,, you can only imagine what it's like at the bottom of the horseshoe falls..",
          "This was an experience well worth the small wait and fee. It was neat to see the short film about Niagara falls before going down the elevator. Some of the staff were extremely rude, however, and it made a bad impression on something that is supposed to be family oriented.",
          "One of the coolest ways to experience the falls.  For the best experience, plan on getting wet and stand on the hurricane deck, feel the power of wind/water!",
          "We visited on a hot day, so it was nice to get wet. My kids enjoyed getting soaked and making their voices echo in the cave. The views of the Falls from this location take your breath away.",
          "I finally stopped in Niagara Falls #365FirstsChallenge on my to Las Vegas and while there it's a must to check out the Cave of the Winds. Being below some of the falls and feeling their power and seeing their beauty was incredible. You can sandals and a poncho and how wet you get is entirely up to you.",
          "Up close and personal with the falls. You will get wet, how much depends on what path you take. Very cool!",
          "One of the best things is I have ever done",
          "I should have done some research to know that they close parts of the trail off season. The short clip was nice but the person working at the ticketing booth seemed unwilling to sell the tickets or talk to us.",
          "Lots of fun for the whole family!\nYou will get wet!",
          "Exhilarating experience.The discovery pass is very convenient,takes you to all the 5 important attractions.Boat ride that takes you to maid of mist is wonderful experience.We followed it with the visit to cave of the winds - equally \u2026",
          "Cave of the Winds is a very unique (and wet) experience. If you're not in a tour group, make your reservations early. You have to schedule a time and they seemed pretty busy. An elevator takes you down to a staging area where you're given a \u2026",
          "Awesome experience. Experiencing the water under the falls is a 'must do' for everyone. You will not regret it.",
          "They give you sandals an a poncho cause your gonna get wet. Depending on the day you could be getting pounded with water it's like being in a hurricane. But the park is clean as beautiful it's a great experience they really let you get close.",
          "Worth the wait for sure. You can get nice and close to the American Falls but beware you will get wet. Sandles and ponchos are provided but both are very cheap quality",
          "Efficient service. Excellent experience. Really lives up to the hype.",
          "Plan on getting wet if you do this. \nThey say all the wood here is replaced annually...",
          "Be warned, there are stairs upon stairs with more stairs. No idea for little ones, people in wheelchairs or require assistance walking. Speaking of walking, you get some cute sandals to wear and a poncho.",
          "An amazing experience seeing the American falls that's close. Be prepared to be wet. Perhaps a fall day wasn't the most ideal time.",
          "The place is great. Wheel chair accessible just short of Hurricane point. However name is a misnomer as the actual caves roof has fallen off so you no longer pass into the \"cave\"  but pass by the foot of the bridal veil falls. You can \u2026",
          "Great place to visit...a must see.",
          "Very nice place!",
          "An experience to remember.",
          "Best experience you can ever have.",
          "If you are going to Niagara Falls, this is the only attraction that you have to go. It's the main one along with Maid of the Mist and is worth the price. Really fun and free sandals as a souvenir.",
          "Absolute must visit if you want to appreciate the natural beauty of Niagara Falls. Tour of the gorge involves a short movie then you take an elevator down to the bottom of the waterfall. Be prepared to get wet, but it is so worth it.",
          "We visited on a first weekend before memorial day. We thought there will be a-lot of people there, but it was not too busy that day and we covered all places. Cave of the Winds is almost an hour walk tour. They will play an AV about niagara \u2026",
          "The experience is amazing. A must visit at least once.",
          "Must visit during peak winter for a unique experience",
          "If you come to Niagara falls it's a good place to come visit.",
          "Just keep climbing till you reach the hurricane deck. It will change your life. The sheer dominance of the falls is breathtaking. The only thing stopping the magnificent force of water from shedding you apart (exaggeration) is layers of \u2026",
          "Awesome experience to see an up close view of the enormity of this place, and feel just a \"splash\" of the Falls' incredible power. This takes you to the outermost tip of the smallest of the three falls, but once there, you'll be immersed \u2026",
          "A MUST! We purchased the discovery pass. Includes the trolley pass, with tickets for maid of the mist, discovery center, aquarium, and movie. It was a great deal, and we are have a wonderful time.",
          "Wonderful. Must always go without missing if going to niagra",
          "Do it! Wear shoes that for well, not the sandals they provide. The decking is always wet and crowded but the photo opp is worth the adventure. Put all your important items in a sealed bag. As you will be very wet walking through the spray of the falls.",
          "Awesome! Wonderful! I am living the life! Experience it",
          "One of the most incredible experiences I've ever had, you can literally stand under part of the American Falls and be pelted by the waterfall. Best thing to do on the American side of Niagara Falls.",
          "Well worth it. Get tickets 1st thing in the am, they sell out.  They provide the footwear and a history movie.  Fun. We use discover passes for american side.",
          "It was cool to be so close to the falls. Unfortunately, the cave itself collapsed due to the falls eroding away at the cliff. So not as cool as it was years ago.",
          "It was amazin, also kinda cold but the view is amazing and the water is cool",
          "Very aesthetically pleasing and eco-friendly location that offers a splendid spot for all vacationers looking to escape from their daily routine - undoubtedly one of the best attractions in the American side of Niagara Falls located in \u2026",
          "This was a real highlight for me - with the little plastic bag and the provided sandals I went right into the falls and came away almost completely dry - so so so fun and so glad I did this",
          "Excellent as I remembered it from 10 years ago. Tip you will get wet :)  There is a new power video and hands on section that the kids enjoyed.",
          "Awesome experience.  Although you have to wait in the queue to get the tickets but it's worth waiting. We wanted to ride maid of the mist but it was not operative due to weather but standing at CAVE OF THE WINDS gave us a fair idea of the experience we could have got in Maid of the mist. In all worth spending money.",
          "Such a great place! Went here with the family and everyone loved it! Be sure to get on Hurricane Deck!",
          "Feltvlika a kid again. Fin and exciting!",
          "This is the best experience to spend your money on, they give you ponchos and shoes to wear and you can spend as much time as you like taking pictures and immersing yourself in the falls.",
          "This is a must do when in Niagara. This will encompass your entire experience and make it the most beautiful one. Very picturesque and you can stand there as long as you want. Be careful you may get a little drenched but they provide you \u2026",
          "Must visit place to experience the Niagara Falls. We came with TakeTours packaged tour which reduced wait time to almost nil. Be sure to wear water wicking clothes and feel the power of water falls! (You get poncho and sandals there) Carry \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit before you die. The sheer amount of water that drops every minute makes it spectacular and cool at the same time, making it a wonderful place.",
          "The process of being at 175 feet underground was pretty fast with a beautiful narrated history of the Falls and great site seeing. I was literally touching the water falls.",
          "Cave of the Winds is so cool! We got to walk around and even stand under the falls! It is an experience that is amazing! You have to come here and experience it for yourself!",
          "Everyone talks about walking around outside and enjoying the view. Before I get into that. I would like to mention there is a lot of seagulls! You need an umbrella or a rain cover, because they will fly all around you, I did get hit by the \u2026",
          "A must go place in Niagara to take a bath in Niagara. It is soooo close. The rush will be less during the early opening hours everyday and we enjoyed every moment of it.",
          "Great fun and educational",
          "Expectacular scenic views. It's a hands on experience where the water falls hits with full force.  Amazing experience!",
          "Really fun... be prepared to get soaked, though.",
          "Amazing!  Kids liked it better than Maid of the Mist.  But prepare for them to be absolutely soaked.  Bring spare clothes.  No need to bring spares for yourself.  Also, watch out for your bags of shoes.  People keep losing their bags of shoes into the falls.  Happened to our party as well.  It\u2019s very windy there.",
          "Often sold out.  Great experience, worth every penny.  Enjoy both maid of the mist and cave of winds.  Trolley between locations is horrible, slow and always full.",
          "Wild, plain and simple.",
          "Exceeded my expectations.   You are so very close to the bottom of the American falls.  The added bonus was the nice visitors center and movie.",
          "This is the best activity at the falls in my opinion. You get to see the falls from the bottom and get really close. The structure seems sketchy but is solid.",
          "What a blast and the hurricane deck was so much fun! If you are visiting the park the is the second best activity.",
          "This is definitely a must try. The experience is something you just should not miss if you are visiting niagra falls. Tickets for the day are only sold on the same day so you might have to visit the ticket counters near the visitors center in niagra state park early in the day.",
          "Great place wonderful view and lots of things to do around there",
          "We didn't wan to leave. It was so beautiful. It was busy. It is a holiday weekend but well worth the wait.",
          "We were able to cross this off the bucket list. There are a lot of steps but we just took our time. Plan on getting wet, really no way to do it with out but it is a great experience!",
          "Truly remarakable experience being around the mighty waterfalls and seeing the rainbow while getting splashed right in front .If u miss it its kind of a loss to visit Niagara.the stairs are absolutely fine and they provide free slippers too",
          "Amazing experience, on you reach the falls you can spend as much time as you want. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I personally recommend it for sure.",
          "This tour has a portion that explains the history of the falls as well as a long elevator ride to the bottom where you can walk around near the falls end.  Lots of fun and lots of seagulls.",
          "It is very nice to have the falls right under you.",
          "We did the cave of the winds winter experience and it was SOOOOOO WORTH IT. we were sure what we were signing up for but my family loved it the guy (who clearly loves the bills) who greeted us at the interactive lobby was awesome and when \u2026",
          "My 2nd time and an awesome experience each time. Earlier i have been in daddy time,  this time it was in late evening which itself a different experience. And loved to see the night rainbow, which was wierd but awesome. Enjoy and plan for it in day time possibly.",
          "Stunning. Super quiet in winter and well worth the visit.",
          "This is the coolest attraction at Niagara Falls. We would 100% recommend this attraction over all others.",
          "A MUST SEE stop at the Falls. Wear shorts or quick dry pants/pant legs. You will get wet. You can't beat the immersive experience of standing in the spray of the falling water. Amazing boardwalk over top of the runoff. Folks love the sandals too - can't believe how many folks you'll see wearing them for the rest of the day.",
          "Out of everything on our trip, the cave of the winds truly made it. Just the experience of getting to feel the waterfall and it\u2019s power, was beautiful.",
          "This place is great!  You have to have a timed ticket to get in, but it's waiting on line after line  to get there. \n First you wait on a line to get a ticket unless you have the Discovery Pass card.  Then you have to wait on a line to get \u2026",
          "Good place for kids to have fun but start early in the day",
          "An adventure. Inside is a film of the history of niagra falls then you take an elevator down to bottom of falls. You walk up a series of stairs with great views of falls. My husband proposed halfway up. Very romantic. There is a very windy \u2026",
          "We visited early spring so only were able to take the elevator down to the base of the Falls, a shortened version of the \"Cave of the Winds\" The museum and movie were informative and well done. Once we got off the elevator felt like we were in the land of seagulls and seagull poop. Took our pictures and got the heck out!!!!",
          "Definitely worth a visit. It is absolutely beautiful. You get to stand below a fall and it's very windy there.",
          "Must experience part of the Falls,  unless you hate getting soaked! It was magnificent to be that close and experience the power of the fails",
          "The hurricane deck is unforgettable.  Yes, you will get wet no matter how prepare you try.  It is a matter of how wet and where.  Recommend to where short pants and t shirt with another layer of water proof top even though they give you a \u2026",
          "Wonderful moment. It's impressing to feel the power of the wind and the water on that part of the falls.",
          "Get up close and personal with the bottom of the falls. Was able to feel the mist on my face. Unfortunately, I came before they finished the renovation of the platforms so I couldn't go too close",
          "Very informative. Helpful, friendly staff, spectacular views.",
          "Awesome attraction.  Prepared to get wet and not use a good camera.  Also lots of birds. Niagara has the biggest diversity in gulls and they are everywhere.",
          "Quiet and surreal to enter the chilly wintery snow park of Goat Island all to ourselves. Still we had to pay $10 to park to access to the area, no exception. \n\nBeware it was frigid on a light rain/snow day today. Totally un(der)staffed and \u2026",
          "totally an insane experience!!! We loved to core and would like to go again. The short movie prior to \"Cave of winds\" makes the whole experience even more enriching by knowing the history of Niagra!!",
          "Pretty cool experience. There is no cave just a boardwalk to under the American falls. You will get wet and it\u2019s a lot of fun",
          "Loved the experience of the power of the Falls.  Felt safe doing the walk and stairs with my hubby. There are many stairs so difficult for those with physical limitations",
          "Enjoyed it very much but for children the lash of water was too strong",
          "Omg beautiful site...amazing photo opportunities...",
          "Breathtaking experience with the falls. Got completely drenched and totally enjoyed it. Must visit",
          "This is by far the best thing I have done in all my life. If your visiting the falls do not go home without visiting the cave of winds. This is the last thing you want to do because nothing will be better that the cave of the wind.",
          "When teens say they had a blast, that's all that matters! Ya gotta go to the base of the falls - THE BEST!",
          "Nice little piece of history, staff is friendly.",
          "These was so much fun! A must do for the American side of Niagara Falls. Prepare to get wet and up close to the Falls.",
          "It was an amazing experience - seeing the power of water from so close. It brings out the kid in you. I bet you cannot wipe your smile during that experience. Oh, wish i can go there again!",
          "Closest to the action. You can really feel the power of falls on this short hike. Lots of stairs but worth it if you take your time. If you don\u2019t want to get wet DONT GO TO THE HURRICANE DECK, otherwise enjoy the water. They give you water \u2026",
          "I could see the waterfall close up and I was happy to see the water directly.\nBut the water in the waterfall did not seem to be clean.\nWhen the waterfalls touched skin, many of my friends' skin became worse.\nFrom the cave of the wind, the \u2026",
          "Loved every moment of it. I recommend going here first then the maid of the mist",
          "This scenic beauty is part of the Niagara falls experience. You can go and feel the falls. There is a lovely view of the horseshoe waterfall and the view of canada and you can see the falls falling on you.",
          "Fun experience despite the slightly rainy weather on the day of our visit! \nYou get to experience the USA site of the falls up close and (if you choose so) get soaked. Certainly recommend wearing the sandals that are given at the beginning \u2026",
          "It was incredible to feel the power of the water up close. They give you sandals to wear.",
          "Absolutely amazing. The hurricane deck is the best part but it is definitely wet.",
          "Best of experience of the entire Niagara Falls state park.. get soaked in the chilling water splash.. save ur mobiles..",
          "Absolutely wonderful!!! Would strongly recommend getting a waterproof camera if you want to take pictures. Also if you could figure out how to not bring in bags and such that would be best because water does get in your poncho! If it's \u2026",
          "Amazing point to see at Niagara Waterfalls. The tour is always busy and needs reservation which starts early morning 8.15 around. The tour starts with watching the history of the power project built in 18th century at Niagara gorge and then \u2026",
          "It was excellent and most fun! The presentation is great and the actual walk is not very difficult for most reasonably healthy people.",
          "Absolutely amazing experience I highly recommend you be very careful when traveling down the stairs though. The water is very cold to so don't be shocked by it.",
          "It was an amazing experience at Cave of the winds specially at 'hurricane Deck' to see water falling from 175 feet up. We were given recyclable sandals and poncho by authority to keep us dry that helped a lot.",
          "Great views of the falls with included informational video",
          "Really fun tourist attraction to see Niagara Falls. A lot of information throughout the history of the falls. And you get to go right up into the Falls themselves. It was beautiful!",
          "It was fantastic! The Hurricane Deck was far and away the best Niagara Falls experience we had. The poncho is more a novelty. Expect to get very wet!!!",
          "Great experience but 2 more elevators are needed to not have to wait so long.",
          "Awesome experience. I thought we was actually going in a cave, but overall it was good",
          "Awesome view, mesmerising feeling... Nature's true masterpiece! A must see if anyone visits Niagara Falls USA side. It is open from April to Early October tho.",
          "In this place, you can walk the way and hit by the waterfall. And you could hear the grand sound of falling water. And there's a line of waiting the elevator, so arrive early, as soon as possible. You must visit here if you want to feel the water of Niagara falls directly.",
          "It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. It's a must for anyone. It will take your breath away.",
          "Wonderful experience!! A must if you are in or near Niagara Falls!!  Incredibly you are right there at the falls. Would do it again for sure!!",
          "Bridal falls and the gorge was beautiful.  Was not impressed with the cave of the winds as the cave collapsed in 1952 and the passage ways have been closed to the public. They are not publicly relaying this information and falsely still advertising for it.",
          "This was my favorite part of my Niagara falls trip. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is going. I went to Niagara falls on memorial day weekend and it was very busy. We waited in line from one to two pm in the the hot sun. It \u2026",
          "Allows you to get as close to the falls as is safely possible. Would strongly recommend. \n\nBe careful with electronics. Expect to get drenched.",
          "Loved the walk up to the edge of the American falls. It was unique to experience just how powerful and majestic Niagara falls is up close.",
          "Watched a video and learned some history prior to taking the walk close to the falls. Got very wet! Those parkas didn't really keep us dry. It was fun and a great experience!",
          "Must see for full Niagara Falls experience. You are given sandals and rain poncho. Go prepare to get wet.",
          "The name of this site is more then appropriate.  Very awesome  place to visit.  There are a lot of steep stairs covered with algae so you have to be careful.  Water, wind, and just amazing the force of mother  nature.",
          "Feel the force of 60,000 gallons of water.  Incredible winds and heavy mist.  Highly recommend",
          "Spectacular view with fall colors and awesome view of the water falls",
          "It came with the tour (Lenny's Tour) was a beautiful thing to see",
          "Awesome, must visit place. It requires pre booking. This pre booking is available at Niagara falls only at any counter.",
          "Paid $45 to be able to walk less than halfway towards the original site so they can do work.  Unbelievable.   Let people go for free until you have it repaired.",
          "Most see attraction! Breath taking!",
          "What an experience! Getting to see the falls from the bottom was awesome! If you want the full experience, make your way to hurricane deck, but be prepared to get wet!!",
          "An awesome place to visit, when we went there was nobody there except for a few people. But the lower half was chained off due to ice being formed on the sidewalks, that was the only downfall, but we did have an awesome time, got some \u2026",
          "Best way to see Niagara. Feel the power of the falls. Great value.",
          "Amazing experience walking right up to the bridal veil falls. A great way to experience the power of the falls. A pair of shoes and a poncho are included in the ticket price.",
          "Went in winter was really great to see.",

          "Little chilly this time of year,  but still beautiful",
          "I don't think reviewing this place in words does any justice to it. My only comment is if you are visiting Niagara Falls on a tight schedule and you have an option of doing just one thing....it would undoubtedly be the Cave of the Winds.",
          "Thrilling experience and eyeful. Don't miss when you visit Niagara falls",
          "Experience to stand in the cold water directly from the falls is truly breathtaking.\nBut on a crowded weekend or holiday the wait times will make you exhausting and will take half of the fun.Unlike the Maid of the mist which is able to \u2026",

          "A place must visit ...\nThe new extension at American side is just amazing. The video on history of the fall and the museum is worth a visit.

        "wiki": "Niagara Falls State Park is a state park in the City of Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York, United States. The park, recognized as the oldest state park in the United States, contains the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls, and a portion of the Horseshoe Falls (also known as the Canadian Falls).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to being protected, the lands surrounding Niagara Falls on both sides of the river were largely controlled by private interests, and public access to the falls was limited. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, an early champion of the Falls' surroundings, began advocating for their preservation in the 1860s. In 1879, at the behest of the New York State Legislature, Olmsted and State Surveyor James T. Gardner helped prepare a special report on the falls' conditions, which argued for increased public access to the falls and recommended that the state purchase lands for that purpose. The report was followed by a publicity and petitioning campaign that helped bring the issue to the public's attention.Olmsted and others formed the Niagara Falls Association in 1883, a group that aimed to lobby New York to acquire and protect the falls from private exploitation. Their efforts succeeded later that year when, on April 30, 1883, a bill authorizing the \"selection, location and appropriation of certain lands in the village of Niagara Falls for a state reservation\" was signed into law by then-governor Grover Cleveland.  The act led to the establishment of the Niagara Reservation in 1885. New York State Assemblyman Thomas Vincent Welch figured prominently in getting the bill signed, and served as the first Superintendent of the Park for 18 years from its inception until 1903.\nNiagara Falls State Park is claimed to be the oldest continuously-operating state park in the United States and the first established via eminent domain.The impetus to protect the falls and improve their accessibility to the public was international; early lobbying for the park's creation was bolstered by similar plans that were proposed for the Ontario side of the Niagara River. Although plans for an international park did not come to fruition, work to establish a park under Ontario provincial authority began in 1885, with the creation of the Niagara Parks Commission. The Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, today known as Queen Victoria Park, was created in 1887.The Niagara Reservation's early design was accomplished by Olmsted and architect Calvert Vaux. The team completed their designs in 1887, with a focus on improving public access while preserving the landscape's natural and scenic elements, to the exclusion of commercial and resort-style attractions.The Niagara Reservation was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1963. It is a major contributing element to the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area.A $44-million refurbishment of the park's facilities was completed in 2003. Work focused on improvements to the park's observation tower, visitor's center, bridges, trails, and other infrastructure.In 2007, Niagara Falls State Park was named as the 10th most beautiful spot in America by The Today Show.\n\n\n== Park facilities ==\n\nIn addition to its views of the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the Canadian Falls, the park overlooks the Niagara Gorge and allows access to the Maid of the Mist tour boats, Cave of the Winds, Goat Island, the Prospect Point Observation Tower, a statue of Nikola Tesla, and the IMAX movie Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic which is shown at the Niagara Adventure Theater.The park also offers a museum, food concession, a movie theater, a gift shop, fireworks, hiking and nature trails, picnic tables, recreation programs, and fishing. The Top of the Falls Restaurant, on Goat Island overlooking the Horseshoe Falls, is also available within the park.\n\n\n=== Discovery Pass ===\nVisitors to Niagara Falls may purchase the Discovery Pass, a guest pass that allows them to enter several attractions at a smaller price. As of 2016, the ticket provides admission to the Cave of the Winds, Maid of the Mist, the Niagara Adventure Theater, the Niagara Gorge Discovery Center, and the Aquarium of Niagara. The ticket also provides discounts for Fort Niagara, and entitles the holder to free gifts at Artpark and the New York Power Project Power Vista.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNiagara Parks Commission - the Ontario provincial agency created in 1885 to manage the shoreline and parks at Niagara Falls and along the Ontario side of the Niagara River.

          "Took the whole family to see Niagara Falls and explore the state park just the other day and I have to say even with the blazing hot temperatures it was an enjoyable experience overall. Everywhere we were around people we were sure to use \u2026",
          "(On the United States side) We have an amazing tip for enjoying the Falls at night. Surprisingly, no one else had this idea. On the pic below you'll see that we put up our hammock between the only two trees that faces the falls perfectly \u2026",
          "Absolutely an amazing place to visit. I parked by the Rapids area (free) and walked all through the park from the Maid of the Mist to The Horseshoe (Canadian) Falls, but there is parking at each major location if you are not into walking. \u2026",
          "We made a relatively quick stop on the way to the airport. It was during a break in a storm, so luckily it was not crowded. Parked for $10 and we were able to see the falls and get some decent pics. Great stop of you have an hour even if you can't get to all the attractions.",
          "Great for destination vacation but too commercialized in my opinion. Even with COVID-19 raging, there were a lot of people in the park NOT wearing a mask. The falls are majestic and the cruise has reopened for your enjoyment. Not all \u2026",
          "Parent with a toddler review \ud83d\ude33\nVery easy to access the whole park..\nSuper clean bathrooms..\nRiding the boat to see the falls was a bit iffy\ud83d\ude2c\nThere's really no safe space to put a small stroller And I wouldn't recommend holding a toddler \u2026",
          "Great place to bring the family and just walk around get your exercise in or come enjoy the the attractions they re-opened. The trolley isn't open yet. Please enjoy yourself and remember social distancing if possible. And face mask is required to get on the attractions.",
          "Niagara Falls is amazing. We spent about half the day there and did the Cave of the Winds. Wow. Views were just breathtaking. Alot of walking though, and some areas you are in direct sunlight. So just make sure you pack enough water and \u2026",
          "Nice area. Everything is nicely maintained and the access areas to the falls leave you with an amazing view of the falls! But the town surrounding the park is seriously lacking any attraction! There is very few restaurants, very few gift \u2026",
          "We visited Niagara Falls State Park during the peak of COVID-19. This meant that any attractions, information booths, and restaurants were closed. That being said, entrance to the park and parking were free, allowing us to walk around and \u2026",
          "I believe all the construction is done so the walk up is really nice. Be weary of the concession stands as they are tourist traps (almost $40 for 3 hot dogs, chips and $3 water bottles!). Bill's Lemonade was amazing though, not too bitter, not too tart.",
          "This was my first time on the American side of the falls. It was absolutely beautiful. My family road on the Maid of the Mist one day and them came back at night to see the falls lite up. It was such a fun experience.",
          "We visited the Niagara Falls state park in the month of September when we could actually see the fall colours everywhere we'd go. We could see the fall colours on our way to the falls. We started from Boston to Buffalo. The weather was so \u2026",
          "to visit this beautiful place it takes 4 days to enjoy the different angles of the falls you can enjoy it at night and during the day ... my best vacations if you want to connect with nature this is the best place!",
          "Love the ability to get up close to the Falls and feel it's power and natural beauty.  Park is clean and organized. Like the newer parking lots along the parkway so you can walk from many spots.",
          "Its absolutely breathtaking, the amount of water, the size it's amazing. Beautiful island and park. A must see",
          "Beautiful and we'll maintained park. many different views of all the different falls. Cave of the winds were closed when we were there. Otherwise we were able to access all views and islands. Kid friendly throughout. Dog friendly. Many places to have a picnic and lots of clean facilities.",
          "Awesome place to spend the day. The improvments made on the island are fantastic.   Maid of the mist is a must at least once in life no better way to see the falls.",
          "What a beautiful way to see the a natural wonder. During 2020 Covid issue the admission to the general park is free. Parking is 10.00 and to ride the boats still costs but with all the pathways open you can get up and personal with the different parts of the falls.",
          "We drove here one weekend when working in Buffalo, NY. It's a great day trip. There is lots of parking and a few places to eat. You'll want good walking shoe and, perhaps, an umbrella or poncho for the mist. The park is well-maintained.",
          "A beautiful site surrounded by a beautiful park, a little relaxed on the safety so be careful with smaller children and the like. It's as pretty during the day has it is at night. While probably the smallest national park I have personally visited still one to check of the bucket list.",
          "It's absolutely amazing. The sights the sound of the water was refreshing and energizing. Enjoyed every second",
          "Niagara Falls is perfect for a weekend getaway. Whether it\u2019s during the winter or summer, you will always enjoy your time here. I prefer the Canadian side compared to the US side. You\u2019ll never run out of things to do here. Many tourist \u2026",
          "An awesome natural phenomena. The trails are well maintained. The sights are amazing. Went on a slow day and there was almost no crowd in the morning. Definitely go over to Three Sisters Islands. The views are spectacular.",
          "Came at midnight, park still open and felt plenty safe letting our boys ride their longboards around the park while the wife and I walked to the various overlooks. So pretty with the falls lit up in different colors.",
          "Wonderful leafy-green and well-maintained park to showcase Niagra Falls.  Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds are highly worth it, and both are wheelchair accessible.",
          "Wow. Pictures can't do this one justice. We came here very early and it wasn't crowded, the temperature was perfect and the waterfall was spouting a large cloud of mist into the sky which resulted in a giant double rainbow. The park was very clean and maintained and everyone was extremely nice. Definitely recommend.",
          "So exciting EVERYTIME! Brought a cousin who's never been here. She's loving the maid of the mist!",
          "This place is Awesome. We took the Maid of the Mist boat tour, Excellent view of the falls. The Mist from the falls felt Great. Absolutely Beautiful!",
          "The views here are breathtaking. The falls are lovely and a must see experience for everyone. The best views are from the Canadian side. Also if you have an opportunity to do the behind the falls tour. It's so worth it. Besides seeing the \u2026",

          "Beautiful place of Niagara Falls on the Am side. I can't wait to come back to walk more of this area. The landscape the greenery the falls are worth coming to.",
          "Lovely place to visit once in a lifetime. Huge waterfalls with view of Canada. Horseshoe bend is very beautiful. Wonderful Experience. Went there with family. Everyone enjoyed a lot. Fireworks at night are too good along with the color changing falls. Overall best experience and worth traveling from New York to Niagara Falls.",
          "Unbelievable views and picturesque settings. Water mist is cold when you are sprayed by waterfalls, but then when you stay back your hot again. We went in July. Bring bug repellant not much mosquitoes but lots of flying insects walking the trails. Bring water and comfortable shoes, lots of walking.",
          "Due to Covid there were not many people which actually made it quite enjoyable since we could get to the view areas with no crowds to fight through. It will be nice to see things back to normal though. Enjoyed a drink at the Top of the Falls restaurant.",
          "Met some really nice guys who offered to take me up stream a little bit to a small swimming hole- pretty much right before the falls...JOKING! Powerful.  Everything you would think it is and more. Best squirrels ever too.",
          "Wow! Enjoyed Niagara Falls on Fathers Day with my close friend! Clean, breezy, friendly and peaceful environment! Wonderful!!!! Brought back good memories as i stared at the waterfalls!! I will be returning I Love it there!!\u2764\ud83d\ude0a",
          "It is an awesome landscape! The Cave of the wind and the Maid of the mist are working but fewer people are allowed in each ride due of the distancing measures. So, it is better to arrive early to buy the tickets.",
          "A beautiful trail takes you along the water to view every part of the falls. The coolest view was actually at the Bridal Falls (at least during COVID19) because you get closer to the waterfalls than you do at the main falls, and you can get \u2026",
          "I've been coming here for years. Today we walked Goat Island and 3 Sisters. The breeze was wonderful. Throughout the walk, the park was clean and trash-free. Unfortunately, too many people not wearing a mask while in close proximity with others. But all in all will be back.",
          "Love this park and with the major renovation project completed, it is much more hospitable now to the visitors. Trails in the woods is also a welcome addition this year.",
          "Beautiful, peaceful place for a walk and to just relax. Gorgeous at night once they turn the lights on at the falls. If you go in the evening I definitely recommend bug spray.",
          "The attractions were good, it's a shame that the city is almost a ghost town, government has to do something about it, that place has a great potential...!!!",
          "What an amazing place to visit. I am so glad we came. Thanks for making us feel so welcome here Niagara Falls, New York.",
          "This is a natural wonder that should be visited again and again and again! I grew up coming here and am glad every time I make the trek back. Don't miss the Cave of the Winds (all seasons) to get you to the bottom of the American and Bridal \u2026",
          "The falls are majestic. I came at night and they have lights on the Canada side that illuminate the whole place beautifully. Came back in the morning and the whole place is just mind-blowing in daylight.",
          "I've lived in WNY most of my life and see the falls many times. It never fails to amaze me!",
          "Basked in the awesomeness of nature. Got soaked. Would do again.",
          "Was very nice to visit even given the ongoing pandemic. Things were starting to open up. The scenery was amazing for this time of year will definitely visit again before the summer is over",
          "Extremely impressive falls. Of course world renowned. The services are  great  and well priced. Highly recommended with a stay in a nearby hotel. It\u2019s worthwhile to do all activities. While you are already there.",
          "Beautiful place to visit.  Ware comfortable shoes,  lots of walking.  The food at North Delaware cafe was great $$.",
          "Beautiful! Words and pictures do not do it justice! If you have never been and get the chance to go, you won\u2019t regret it! Maid of the mist is must!",
          "He\u2019s beautiful but the walk is hard there is no transportation that will take you from one spot to the other I would not recommend it for older people that can\u2019t walk or have pain in the legs",
          "This has really been improved. Get up and personal to the falls. Great walking paths take you to all the sites. Visit the overlook by the maid of the mist. So many picture opportunities. Stop and see the visitors center and get acquainted with the history of the falls. Bring the whole family and enjoy!",
          "Everything has changed for the worse, the hotels have reduced their services and increased the prices of everything, add to all this the panic created by the media and you will have an atmosphere that has nothing to do with a pleasant \u2026",
          "Such an extraordinary experience! The weather is so nice even during the summer and it's a great place to visit with family or friends.",
          "A beautiful well managed park with lots to see and do.  You get a fantastic view of the falls, there is a trolley that will shuttle you around to different areas of the park, and picnic areas too.  You can spend the whole day here without getting bored.  Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Everything you have heard, and more. A natural wonder worth visiting more than once. I visited in winter and can't wait to see again in the summer.. be sure to give yourself plenty of time to visit. The fog and weather can change quickly, you don't want to miss out on seeing the Falls at their best.",
          "The falls are absolutely beautiful,  but they need to pay more attention to taking care of all the weeds that are destroying the beauty of the atmosphere.  Last time I was here it was kept up this time, not so much.",
          "Beautiful \ud83d\ude0d one of America's \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 treasures. Must see\ud83c\udf0a attraction. Great food also.",
          "Very magnificent. So much water going over the falls. Nice river side trails and parking is not two expensive. Some parking is free. Neat places to see. There are hotels in the area also. A lot of  Restaurants",
          "Niagara Falls is an amazing spot. The park has great walking paths to take you to all the lookout points",
          "Niagara Falls, was one of the best experience\u2019s I\u2019ve ever had. The water fall is amazing during the day, most is going everywhere, but sometimes the falls is hard to see, that\u2019s why at night they light it up! It makes a giant waterfall look like a giant rainbow! It is truly a spectacular sight.",
          "Niagara Falls State Park is very corona safe and a pleasant place to visit. With a limited amount of people visiting, you feel safe and relaxed.",
          "One of the most beautiful natural wonders in the United States.\n\nThe New York side has a few nice shops with some interesting things to do, but the magic here is watching the Falls. It\u2019s amazing peaceful!\n\nAt the right angle, you can see \u2026",
          "Great hike in the gorge just wish people understood the social distancing rule a bit better and wore a mask where they were unable to.",
          "Definitely different from what I remember as a kid. Unfortunately my visit was during covid so not much was available",
          "A truly beautiful part of the world and a must see for a day trip out. We visited during out holiday to Toronto. Couple of hours travelling on the coach to an unforgettable afternoon at one of the natural wonders of the world.",
          "Niagara Falls, one of the 7 wonders of the world. One of the greatest places to visit. Photos taken from Maid of the Mist (NY side)",
          "It was great on the boat! But since the covid19 everything is closed! So only thing to do is ride the Mid Mist and walk around! June 26, 2020.",
          "Due to covid-19 not much was open.. but to get to see such natural beauty.. was awesome",
          "Definitely go on The Maid Of The Mist ! The gift shop, visitors center, and concession stands are closed right now. The sights were beautiful though.",
          "Beautiful,  nothing like nature to refresh and recharge. Almost a ghost town (most things are closed) bc of COVID-19 but that was actually a good thing since we didn't have to contend with crowds, long lines, and long waits for the Maid of the Mist or Cave of the Winds. Only missed the aquarium but still worth the trip.",
          "Awesome site! Maid of the Mist and Cove of the Winds Still Open Post-Covid! The all just close a little earlier...",
          "Wow! Be sure to visit this place if you're in Buffalo or from Canada. It's beautiful. We took the tour maid of the most and it was a wonderful experience. Totally enjoyed it. I make sure to visit the place every time I am in Buffalo. Such a beautiful serene place.",
          "Very scenic. It's definitely worth the $10 for parking. The Chargepoint charger is free.",
          "The falls were beautiful and all the surrounding trees are pretty as well. However it would have been nice to get closer to the falls.",
          "The mask enforcement with social distancing is pretty low right now.. otherwise beautiful park..",
          "Lots of trails and neat areas to walk around on. In general, a small park but worth the visit!",
          "We visited the Niagara Falls state park in the month of September when we could actually see the fall colours everywhere we'd go. We could see the fall colours on our way to the falls. We started from Boston to Buffalo. The weather was so \u2026",
          "Getting some fresh air and social distancing. A beautiful walk around Goat Island on the Trail 1.92 miles around. Very safe place to be right now, very few people and there are no parking fees during this National Emergency. Be safe everyone.",
          "Spent a whole day on the US side. Not nearly as developed as the Canadian side. Could use some more attractions to bring some more tourist dollars into the NY side.",
          "I have no words to explain the beauty of this place !! I\u2019ve lived in buffalo for about 4 years and I\u2019m never bored to go to the falls. I always take my family and friends who come to visit me here!! This is definitely a bucket list item everyone should have !!",
          "I took my boys last week and we had an amazing time. Unfortunately a lot was still closed and opening the upcoming weekend though. That just means another trip is soon to come!",
          "This place is truly amazing!! Unfortunately none of the boat tours or shops were open because of Covid. But it's still something that needs to be seen.",
          "Love the night scene they have going down there. They spray the park for bugs at night and plenty of local bars",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Everything was closed but still could walk the park and parking was free because of Covid 19. The kicker was that it is dog friendly.",
          "I wish everyone could experience this in there life time i am very fortunate to do it with my niece and granddaughter.",
          "Lots of fun things to do, just take a friendly pair of shoes. Theres so much to see and that requires alot of walking.",
          "Niagra falls is like a dream come true. If you are a nature lover and can appreciate unusual things, this place is a must see place. Add to your bucket list. It won't fail you, the sound of waves crashing into the falls and the breathtaking \u2026",
          "Really beautiful went for 4th of july and had a blast , not as many people but still alot if you're worried about covid 19",
          "There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about the park. Niagara Falls was a bucket list wish for me and it did not disappoint. The park and the Falls are absolutely breathtaking; words simply cannot describe the beauty \u2026",
          "I went on a really quiet day.  Nobody around.  Got some good pictures.",
          "It was really nice. I will definitely returned. I was expecting people to be rude but they were really nice.",
          "Breathtaking. American Falls side. Some things Not available due to COVID. However still a breathtaking experience.",

          "NICE WALK AND VIEW OF THE FALLS,  CLOSE TO SHERATON HOTEL, AND $10 PARKING AVAILABLE.",
          "It is very pretty here! If you are in the Buffalo area you should definitely stop and take a walk! Parking is 10 dollars but you can walk around and explore! There are many food and gift stores close by also",
          "What an amazing experience! It was empty today and we thoroughly enjoyed it all! Coming back soon!!!!",
          "I will never get board of visiting Niyagara falls again and again. It is such a beautiful place to visit.\n\nThe most valuable thing is the boat ride that goes closer to the bigger falls you may get wet though. I did not want to go initially \u2026",
          "Expected more and no water stands didnt get warned bikes sure run everyone so much closed  but enjoyed eating outdoor. Would love to go again.",
          "Bring a light jacket or hoodie if the temp is below 75. Trust me you will feel comfy because of water its little cooler in that area, specially Goat Island",
          "Really nice state park. Easy hike, beautiful views and many places to view the falls from different angles.",
          "World's one of Best touring area, Great resturants and foods available here, Its Border with Canada both sides are wonderful, i will go to American Falls first . Love this Place, Life is so beautiful and Romantic.",
          "I think no review is needed for Niagara Falls. If people want to decide to go to niagra fall, they not gonna see any review. They just directly go. I visited niagra falls. Its awesome. O My God.",
          "Niagara Falls State Park was very lovely. There was ample parking. I liked the Riverside walkway/paths. The observation deck is amazing. If you decide not to do the Maid of the Mist, you can still see a lot from the top of the observation \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing, must walk thru the park and enjoy all it offers, hoping to go back when everything is open after covid to experience caves of the winds",
          "For only $5 to park, it\u2019s a great spot. Can wander off on the trails when it\u2019s nice out but here is closest to the American side of the falls and where you check out maid of the mist. In the winter the observatory look out deck is free and \u2026",

          "Nothing like the Falls. So much to see and do. Great Visit.",
          "Loved it. Not busy. Went at night",
          "As a local I'm very blessed to live near such a beautiful waterfall. I recommend going when the weather is warmer. There's more to do on old falls street and it's just much better of a walk if it's warm. (The maid of the mist is also open during summer haha)",
          "BEAUTIFUL site we also went at night where the falls lights up different colors it was a amazing experience",
          "So much to see and it is very beautiful. The staff that works there are very informative and friendly.",
          "The view is breathtaking! Truly one of the wonders of nature.\nThe museum has some interesting photos and history of the place.\nThe only thing that puts me down is the lack of nice restaurants/stores close in the US side.",
          "Love the state park!! But the city could put up more family friendly attractions and restaurants just like the Canadian side.",
          "A geographical marvel. The ferry ride to the fall is amazing. One of the few I liked the most in the USA (others are Grand Canyon and Yellow Stone National Park, being a Geography lover)",

          "It was beautiful was my first time as an adult and I will make sure I see this beautiful soul of mother nature again",
          "I was very pleasantly surprised how many improvements have been made since my last visit 25 years ago. The walkways are clean, easily accessible, and the facilities are modern. A NYS parks pass, if you have one, will save you a little $$. \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed visiting Niagara Falls! Even though it was freezing cold in Janaury, visiting the falls was still a pleasure. It is such a beauty and really makes you appreciate nature. It's a fun place to go in a large group or even with a smaller group. If you are going with kids, I would say bring loads of snacks along.",

          "1st time and loved it. You MUST take the walk down to see the 3 sisters \u2764",
          "It's still super busy.  An international attraction and likely hot spot for good and bad things to happen",
          "Beautiful beautiful Park. The sound of the water, lushness of the trees, geese everywhere; it was a site to behold. Going back when they open up the Canada side.",
          "Beautiful Experian another beautiful creation made by Father God.",
          "The falls are incredible. I stayed on the New York side and the view is still great. I highly recommend going out to the observation tower to get a better angle. In the winter (Nov-Mar) there are a lot of things closed, but what is open is significantly cheaper.",
          "Beautiful and very NOT crowded. Covid-19 hurting the park. But the selfish side enjoyed the hell out of it.",
          "This is a must see!!!! One of the natural wonders of the world that will blow your mind when you are actually on the edge of the falls.  The ride under the falls is a great experience.  We drove all around the area and followed the river to \u2026",
          "Niagara state park is awesome!!!  Now I understand why it is one of the great wonders of the Earth. Plenty of events and parking. Everything is within walking distance. Everything you see you want to take a photo in addition to that one is temped to go to Canada because you can see all the cool stuff over there.",
          "Beautiful place very relaxing come every time out that way too look at the falls",
          "Impressive views. Be prepared for the rain or the drops of water generated by the falls. It\u2019s a place to walk and just enjoy. It maybe a bit slippery, beware. It\u2019s a short ride from Buffalo, NY. \nBe careful not to have your US mobile phone \u2026",
          "One of the 7 wonders of the world!  The park is wonderful!   Definitely a must see if on the NY side.  Wear appropriate clothing depending upon weather.   Very nice views,  archway,  architecture etc.  We will be back!   Highly recommend!",

          "Beautiful as always. It is commercialized but the parks service does a good job of not letting the infrastructure ruin the beauty. Limited food options but not a huge problem. I would suggest looking at the various extra excursions beforehand to make sure you get tickets.",
          "The views here are breathtaking. The falls are lovely and a must see experience for everyone. The best views are from the Canadian side. Also if you have an opportunity to do the behind the falls tour. It's so worth it. Besides seeing the \u2026",
          "We parked at Maid of The Mist parking lot for $10. The $3 trolley is well worth it, especially with multi-age & walking ability companions. \nThe stops are each well worth a hop off. We were there off-season and I can see how long the wait \u2026",
          "Beautiful! Beautiful scenery. I went during Wintery weather and so it was freezing but the view was breathtaking. I would recommend going to Maid of the Mist. You see tons of views even from the Canada side too. Go visit with family!",
          "The state park if we'll maintained with clean trails and bathrooms, even during the pandemic. It takes about 2 hours to walk around the entire place looking at the falls but other than that there isn't much to do or see.",
          "Have been here several times in the last 5 years and through most every season, but only on the American side. Got to go on the overlook deck for free once when it was all frozen over! Great views day or night. Really take your time and wonder across the bridges to the horseshoe falls",
          "Just amazing!!! I cant even describe all of the falls beauty it was such an amazing sight I would definitely want to go again some time. Highly recommend the maid of the mist!",
          "It was my dream to go there, even tho I live 2 hours from it never had the time to go, but we were on a trip from Buffalo and decided to stop by...

          "The air was so refreshing with the fresh water flowing from the falls. Plus, you can see the canadian border from the niagra falls state park. There's a restaurant right in the square of the park but unfortunately with the pandemic it was not open. Will visit this place again someday from the canadian side...",
          "Nothing much to say that hasn\u2019t already been said. Wonderful place to visit with your family. The spectacular Niagara falls with view of Canada, several attractions, lots of parking, trams for easy commute, lots of options to grab a bite. \u2026",
          "Being a Canadian I wondered how the US Niagara Falls could possibly offer a better visit when the Canadian park has so much to see and do.  Man I was so wrong.  This state park, like most other, is tastefully constructed.  The observation \u2026",
          "Falls are Awesome!  Even better if only everything wasn't fenced off and shutdown!",
          "Great place to go, the entrance to the park is for free and it's a lot to see and walk. The boat it's closed in winter time, but the experience is wonderful anyway since the place it's almost empty from people, so you have the chance to take very nice pictures and wander around watching the wildlife",
          "Will never get board of visiting Niagara Falls. Such a beautiful place, nicely designed. It\u2019s a little bit of walking from park lots. If you have heavy stuff or a baby make sure to bring a trolley. Food is expensive, I would advise you to bring snacks and drinks from home.",

          "Great place to walk and get some great pictures. The observation deck was cool and provided a better view of the falls than the lower area near the gardens. Depending on where you stand, you can see all three falls some areas only see two. \u2026",
          "After all these years still finding new areas of this park to explore.",
          "Always worth the $10 to park.  Amazing, what a creation made by God.  It was cold today especially for a now Florida resident.  Couldn't go back without getting some Niagara Falls mist on my face.  \ud83d\udc4d",

It's really easy to spend a couple of hours just walking around and you'll save on the parking. If you have to drive, just pick a spot cause you can essentially walk around everywhere.",

          "I loved seeing the falls, but with that being said I wish I could have seen them from the Canadian side. Don't see them on the American side. The American side near the falls is a very depressed area. Looking over to Canada looked a lot more fun. You can defiantly tell that their local economy is doing better.",
          "What a wonderful park and really, you can see it all for free. Such a romantic place to walk at night. We were there early October. The weather was perfect and it was peaceful. I will be back next year. This is my vacation place now...",

          "Awesome place to visit and watch the water go over the falls. It is amazing of how nature is with this huge waterfall. You can see the Canadian side and all the stuff to do over there. The USA side there's more about nature and history. It's worth the trip.",

          "Just relaxing it was nice and early the weather was great just enjoyed the scenery",
          "Brought a friend during the COVID-19 pandemic, since state parks are open and there's little else to do. No one was openly enforcing social distancing, but the park appeared quite clean. Clearly, crews are still out taking care of litter and the footpaths.",
          "Breathtaking views of the falls below. However the experience getting back up top from our ride on Maid of the Mist was horrible. The lines for the elevators need to be better managed. Pushing and cutting lines lots of disrespectful people and no one to manage the chaotic lines. Ruined an otherwise nice adventure. .",

          "Quite frankly the US side of the Falls as far as the town is concerned is a bit desolate.... there are 2 attractions here, the Casino and the Falls themselves.   I have seen the Canadian Side many times, and that is the view most people are familiar with, but the American side is well worth the look if you get the chance.",
          "I have been here 3 times in last 7 years and every time I felt like heaven after visiting Niagara Falls. Cave of the winds and Maid of the mist is the most amazing natural thing you see in United States. Plan your visit between may and july if you really want to have fun with water.",

          "Lots to do, not too busy when we went in the off season. The pass you can buy is really helpful and helps to control costs if you're vacationing on a budget like we were. The shop is small but well stocked, and the refreshments stand has variety.",
          "Amazing experience! I love it so much first time getting too close to falls in my life. Per grad in the place in Sumner you could get even closer for wonderful memories pictures. Its woth to pay $12 to watch historical movie fir 10 min about Niagara Falls and then get down for closer view.",
          "I remember the first time that I saw the falls. The force of the rapids near Goat Island and the falls is unimaginable. We have returned multiple times and it is always amazing.",
          "A definite place to see. My wife and I loved the beautiful views and activities there. Only thing that was disappointing was that we didn't get to do the boat tour due to weather that day. Viewing the falls from the Canada side is a must see, breath taking view.",
          "Definitely, one of the best places in USA. I enjoy watching at the falls during the night because there are lights reflecting the water that change of color. It was very nice to see.",
          "It was amazing. Stunning and intimidating at the same time but I loved it!!",
          "A must go. It\u2019s beautiful. Definitely do all the extra\u2019s. Did everything in a day should have left a little more time. But it was definitely still doable. Drove from north Jersey, gorgeous drive! It was such a fun trip! Would absolutely go back again.",
          "My family and in-laws-to-be shared a great family experience here. The park is well maintained and family friendly. \nOur favorite part was the Cave in the Winds. The view was absolutely spectacular. The trek from the bottom to near the \u2026",
          "the falls were beautiful and it was very easy to walk around and explore! it was super cold though and the spray from the waterfall made me colder, so try to visit on warmer days",
          "The American side is very nice. Parking is great, free at night. Great facilities, views, etc.",
          "Our family has a fantastic time at the falls. Parking can be a bit expensive, so earlier the better. They have a lot that was $10 but seemed to be constantly full. There are other lots around the park that go from $10 in the morning to at \u2026",
          "Niagara Falls is one of the most beautiful places on Earth...\nIf you have the chance to come here, I highly recommend it",
          "Love this place lots to see! Best state park ever, organized, clean and the lay out was easy to follow.",
          "Tons of things to do here like the Cave of Winds or Maid of the Mist. Parking is $10 if you want to be closer to the Falls. If not you get parking closer for less or even free.",
          "I loved Niagra falls my family really enjoyed it! We loved taking the boat and going close up to the falls it was great.",
          "It is an excellent spot to visit. Very the magnificent falls the light show, fire works etc are superb. Light show can be seen daily from 7pm to 2 am . Where as the fireworks only on Saturday and Sunday. Additional information: Niagara can \u2026",
          "Ot was amazing it was magical it was everything I thought it would be and more",
          "The most amazing trip this year. Was there for 2 days. Reached Niagra falls station on Sat evening. They have amazing fireworks at night on weekends. Next day used the Discovery pass(i would say its a must have) to visit Cave of the winds, Maid of the mist. The pass also covers aquarium, outdoor move and museum.",
          "Nice trails and great views. If you want to see Horseshow Falls though, go to the Canadian side. But - amazing views of the rapids, American Falls, and Niagara Falls Ontario.",
          "Great place to visit. It's free to walk in and see the beautiful falls (except parking). There are optional, paid activities  with many restaurants and stores.",
          "Amazing natural wonder!  I want to go back one day and visit to the Canadian side.  The park is having work done so we had to take the long way around, a little difficult for mom, but the rest of us enjoyed the walk.",
          "Nice & quiet. Even saw family of Geese walking by...",
          "Still One of Of My *FAVORITE* Places to Go!!:-) I Just *LOVE* Visiting the *Canadian-Sixe of the Falls, too and Seeing those \"Black\" Squirrels!! They Are SO *ADORABLE*!! But, WATCH OUT!! They May Steal A *French Fry Or Two!!:-)",
          "One of the best places for waterfalls. On a normal weekend it's not that much crowded. The fireworks happen at 10.00pm for 5 min at the American falls and the lights on the falls is really good. A better place to view the lights  would be \u2026",
          "This is 1 place that y'all have got to visit year after year and anytime of year. Niagara Falls changes every season and it's breathtaking every season. Visiting Niagara Falls itself is also very breathtaking and there lots of things to see \u2026",
          "This place is great definitely a must see if you have the chance. The only thing to remember is to avoid the gift shop. They were super pricey and really cheap quality. The staff here is friendly for the most part and very helpful.",
          "What a fun day trip. Once you get past all the tourist trap restaurants, that are not worth eating at, the place is great. Wonderful scenery and lots to walk around and see. The falls are beautiful. Not sure why people sat the Canadian side \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful location that our family was able to visit. Wide open area, with plenty of viewing spots available to get some great photos. Pets can come through the main building down to the falls area,  but not on the attractions. \u2026",
          "A beautiful experience that every American and every Tourist should have the pleasure to do and mark off their Bucket list.\n\nThe Niagara falls is A phenomenon that takes your breath at first sight, I loved visiting it!!!\n\nIf you get here \u2026",
          "What an experience. Seeing Mother Nature at her beautiful best. The Maid of the Mist is a must but if you can, come back in the evening for the light show and the fireworks... You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "Every bit as impressive as the Canadian side, NF State Park is less touristy and more natural beauty.\nMyself, I love what both sides have to offer.  If time allows, do both sides. They are both great!",
          "Just wonderful!!! The best place ever I visited.\nI would like go back on there again.....Beautiful...",
          "Loved it!!! The Guards tried to catch me but I never new jumping off into the water would be so much fun!! Here I am 1 year later out of jail and after paying a $4,000 fine but.... it was all worth it I had the time of my life only down side the water was soooo cold",
          "I have visited Niagra Falls on the Canadian side several times before, but this was my first visit to the Falls and Niagara Falls State Park. I am so glad we took the time to visit because it was beautiful, especially this time of year! \u2026",
          "I usually go on Canadian side but this time I decided to go on U.S. side and it was the best decision I made. There's a saying that you can see the falls on Canadian side but u can feel them on U.S. side and this is true. I love to feel them. It's more relaxing. Best place ever\ud83e\udd70",
          "One of the most iconic places in all of the United States. It ranks right up there with the Grand canyon. If you haven't traveled to see this Wonder of natureyou should put it on your bucket list and make the journey.",
          "A must stop if you want to see both Falls. Parking was reasonable at only $10 with many trails, a trolly to get around if you're tired, cafes and restaurants. Easily located bathrooms and benches to sit down, relax and enjoy the view. Could easily spend all day exploring.\n\nHad a fun experience and would come back \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Great place to see the falls parking does cost 5$. The closer viewing areas were closed off because of the snow.",
          "Absolutely stunning and beautiful! God's creation does not disappoint. \nThe area surrounding the park is very built up and geared towards tourism. However, the park itself is very beautiful and clean, despite being busy. The falls \u2026",
          "No matter how many pictures or videos you\u2019ve seen, standing before the falls remains a breathtaking and awe-inspiring experience.",
          "Very beautiful. I went on the Maid of the Mist boat and had a blast. The price of about $20 per adult was worth it. They even gave us a souvenir postcard. I've been here a few times growing up and as an adult. Always fun. I've only been on \u2026",
          "Niagara falls at that point as a fairy tail. You can feel you are in your dream. Also, Niagara Falls opened perfect view on Canada.",
          "Amazing. Niagara Falls is a beautiful sight to see. There are good walking trails all around it, with plenty of venders. You can even take a tour on the ferry that goes up close to the fall, if you want get drenched! Niagara falls is a beautiful sight to see.",

          "Beautiful! We had a great time, the park is well maintained and the experience of taking the boat and going close to the falls was amazing. They have to do a better job at the Visitor's Center it is not well organized. We waited for long \u2026",
          "Beautiful way to start the New Year! Lovely day, great guide and pleasant hike around 3 sisters islands. #Firstdayhike",
          "Maid of the mist boat ride was awesome... cave of the winds was so exciting... right under the fierce falls.. so refreshing.. discovery pass for 46 $ gave us access to maid of mist, cave of winds, the aquarium and the discovery centre and \u2026",
          "If I'd have to describe Niagara Falls in one word that would be MAJESTIC! I recommend everyone to go to Niagara Falls at least one time in their lives. The Maid of the Mist was my favorite activity. The boat take you by the falls where you can see them from very near. Simply beautiful. I also recommend the cave of the winds.",
          "Beautifully maintained park with easy access to all the features. Cave of the Winds walk was incredible and the Maid of the Mist is the best way to experience the full power of the Horseshoe Falls. Far better than the Hornblower boat on the \u2026",
          "One of the most gorgeous parks in the States. We visited the park and it's beautiful islands and it has a beautiful running-walking path by the river which is spectacular. You'd better discover the park if you've already visited the falls side bc that takes several hours.",
          "My step daughter and her awesome new husband had a beautiful wedding here in Niagara falls. Its incredible at night. We stayed at the Comfort Inn Pointe. Which is located right there within walking distance of everything. There are \u2026",

          "Absolutely stunning! We went for my moms birthday and they made her feel so special and the view was breath taking! I do however recommend going in the sping/summer because we went in October and it was FREEZING lol still an amazing experience!",
          "Great fun for the family. Being immersed in the sounds of the rushing water, the spray from the falls and exploring the different views and statues around the park is a nice way to spend to some time with the family. During the summer there \u2026",
          "Lovely day walking around and seeing the falls close up. Only negative was  90% of people did not wear a face mask.",
          "Great way to see the falls with the family. The line for Cave of the Winds was very long (Saturday midday) so we didn't partake in that, and still really enjoyed ourselves. It took about 1.5 hours to walk around the park. Stroller and dog \u2026",
          "If you never been here, then you should make a trip in your lifetime visit here.  The power of the fall will mesmerize you.  Definitely to do the boat tour.  You can save a little bit to buy the package.   It includes the aquarium (not so \u2026",
          "It was a decent day to get out. Alittle upset that some of the falls was blocked off because of the weather conditions which is understandable as well for safety reasons. Wish more things were open though during the winter (restaurants and shops) because they still get visitors.",
          "Wow. You see pictures but it just doesn't do it justice. You have to experience it for yourself. The view is definitely better from the Canadian side or from the Maiden of the Mist Boat tour but you can get pretty close from a couple spots \u2026",
          "Simply beautiful!  Make it a trip to one of the wonders while it\u2019s still here!  The barge was luckily there when I visited.",

          "Amazing scenery, of course. Disappointed that the grounds aren't better maintained.",
          "We have never been to Niagara Falls, so we decided to take a Gray Lines tour. Actually we took 2 tours, the American tour and the Canadian tour. Both tours were fantastic.  We were there on a Tuesday,  and though there were a lot of people, \u2026",
          "BEAUTIFUL park especially since it's America's 1st State Park",
          "Everyone said \"Go see the Falls from the Canadian side, it's so much prettier!\" Well they have no idea what they are talking about. This is an actual PARK! It's not over crowded with shops, rides, streets that are hard to cross, buildings \u2026",
          "Loved it!!!!  The weather was perfect. The falls were flowing.\n\nIt was great to see them from our hotel and to walk down to see them. \n\nI did not take any tours our boats ride although many people did. \n\nIt is great for families. \n\nGo and enjoy!!!",
          "I walk the trail in Niagara almost everyday. eventually gets me next to the river and all the way to table rock to see the falls. Everything is kept perfectly clean and friendly.",
          "Great place. A must see vacation destination. The lights at night over the Falls are awesome.",
          "The waterfalls are very special and worth too see, but for me it is to much \"public\". It's very touristic, especially the Canadian site. \nI think it was a beautiful place, before we build a lot of things around this waterfalls. Now it is \"just\" a nice place.",
          "You better check this destination out around dusk! You get to see the fall in bright day light, then sunset and finally with the lighting coloring the fall! Breathtaking!",

          "AMAZING VIEW AND LOVE THE NATURE UGH!!",
          "Breathtaking waterfall views, even at night with the light shows. Would recommend the maid of the mist, getting so close to the waterfall and feeling the sheer force of the water coming down is a whole another level of enjoyment. There's fireworks at 10 pm, you can go grab food from nearby stalls and come back in time to watch it",
          "My best vacation so far. I really enjoyed with my kids. Maid of the mist is great - it is a 20 min. ride, but Cave of the winds is awesome 'coz you can get soaked as much as you want. Definitely buy the discovery passes, which includes the \u2026",
          "Breathe taking views. Plenty to see and take in.  Even in the colder seasons.  Highly recommend checking things out at night.  Stay away in colder weather if winds are high.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking views! There's a reason why Niagara is so famous. Both falls are beautiful, but there are a couple important things to know...\n1. The Canadian side is much busier than the American side. It also has a better view of \u2026",
          "I absolutely LOVE Niagara Falls!! It always amazes me, and this time we mingled with the wildlife! The squirrels and birds are not afraid of folks. They want food and are sweet when they take it out of your hand. \nI did have a hard time on \u2026",

          "Checked it off the bucket list. Absolutely stunning!!",
          "Many enjoyable activities and sights. Plan for at least one full day into the night. The lighting of the Falls is a must see. We only explored the American side this trip but we'll be back.",
          "Niagara Falls- Situated in Niagara Falls State Park - America\u2019s Oldest State Park. The most amazing experience at the falls is the Maid of Mist Boat tour - to the basin of Horseshoe Falls. Best way to explore Niagara Falls is to take the \u2026",
          "Best place I have visited so far. Bridal veil fall and mist are amazing here",
          "Beautiful park! Great view and you might get really wet if the wind is against you. Make sure that you check out all view points because the first you (and the most popular) is not the one with the best view. If you want to go down they sell boat tours and a guided tour at the bottom of the falls",
          "Just beautiful!!  The park is serene and has plenty of places to stretch out and enjoy.  A great place to spend the day, or even just a couple of hours if in the nearby area.",

          "The Falls are magnificent. The park is phenomenal. The area surrounding it is NOT; except for across the border! Who would have thought our Northern neighbors would have been more capitalistic than us! A lot going on across the border\n On our side - just the park.",
          "It was beautiful! I am so glad we went in the off season! There were not as many people but the view was just as stunning! Definitely recommend going to the Canadian side if you have a passport!",

          "Absolutely amazing and a must see.  Went with the family as a side trip and ended up being the most relaxing part of the whole trip.  We stayed looking at the falls and walking around for a very long time.  It was so relaxing that our young ones slept most of the time.  Looking forward to our next trip back to see the falls again.",
          "Nice view of two different sides of the fall. Horseshoe falls and American falls. Must visit in the night time to see changing Colors of the Niagara falls. Overall very beautiful place. Also nice  view of the skyline on the Canadian side of the fall .",
          "Gorgeous and so much to do!  It was crowded on Labor Day weekend and very unorganized and expensive.   However it was worth it.  It's just incredible to be able to walk or ride the trolley all around and see the beautiful river and falls! \u2026",
          "Amazing. My mother took me here for my 25th birthday. It was by far the best thing I have experienced in my life. If you are in to the history and want to get the top notch view's plus fire works do the tours. The tour guides are fun and informative.  The boat ride was amazing. I love this park!!!!",
          "One of the world best place to visit.  Enjoyed our walk during the evening this time.",
          "Incredibly easy to access.  Very affordable for the unique experience.  The crows nest was open, after the boat tour. It was very exciting to experience the falls from a different perspective.",
          "Seeing the falls left me with a feeling of awe.  The power and grace of nature is on continuous display at this park.  If you can, take a \"Maid of the Mist\" boat tour.  The boats take you right up to the falls and you really get a sense of the grandeur of the place.  Really cool experience.",

          "A beautiful specimen of nature. I just got back from the American side of the falls and it was breathtaking. Can't even imagine how the Canadian would be. I love how close you can get to the falls when you're touring the caves. Truly \u2026",
          "Free park entry! Parking can be the tricky part. We found pay-by-the-hour metered parking, on an adjacent side street to the park, located in front of the gazebo. A parking garage and pay-lots were also options. Beautiful sights, most \u2026",

          "Truly a must see. Walk through nature at its finest. The falls are a incredible site. The roaring sound of the falls and the rapids are exhilarating. Parking is $10.00 and there is no fee to enter the park.",

          "Amazing views of the falls from up close!",
          "This was my third visit to the Falls. The first was the American side, and we walked a fair amount. It was nice, but not as impressive as I'd imagined. The second visit was to the Canadian side. We didn't walk as much, but the facilities \u2026",
          "Beautiful, serene park just above the falls on the American side but much better view of the falls on the Canadian side. General Hornblower cruise took us very close to the falls. Also awesome tour behind the falls. Both on Canadian side!",
          "Beautiful, truly stunning, just poor timing with most activities shut down.",
          "I'm not sure I'm a person that should be reviewing the Niagara Falls. This is obviously beautiful and a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some of us. It was thrilling oh, because you were able to actually see and hear the force of the water \u2026",
          "This place is insane! It's awesome to see such an incredible natural wonder in all it's glory. Absolutely stunning views and quite nerve-wracking for somebody who is afraid of heights like me. It's worth the walk to go around the falls and \u2026",

Restaurant at top of falls closed on Labor Day for end of season...bummed about that but great food available right outside of park. Souvenirs well priced as well...taking a bunch back to Texas.",
          "Great! I love visiting N. Falls in all the seasons I just think the 10 dollar parking is was over priced. And so is the gift shop but other then that it's a 5 star",
          "Lots of great scenery but a lot my fellow tourists were not from the USA and seemed to go out of their way to be ignorant. Maybe it is considered normal to just barge your way through a crowd in the Middle East and Orient but it is not \u2026",

          "We visited the place in the middle of December. There were minimum tourists, one day we had the niagara all to ourselves. Niagara looked stunning, covered in snow all around. The most beautiful view i have ever seen",
          "This is truly a must see. The falls are simply amazing.... words and photos simply don't do justice to the majesty and power of the falls. We took the Maid of the Mist boat tour. Which is beyond words fabulous and well worth the charge. \u2026",

          "Dirty,, and touristy..\nYes, it should be a \"bucket-list\" thing,, but once you go,, you probably won't feel the need to go again. We literally spent 15 down at the actual falls.\nThen we ended up going to the Indian Casino, which was only a \u2026",

          "Such an amazing experience. The state park is small enough to park at one end and walk to the end where the cave of the winds and the maid of the mist, but you don\u2019t have to walk all the way. There is a trolley. We would definitely go back. \u2026",

          "I visited the Canadian  side 8 years ago during the summer and I loved it  because of the lights and all the Vegas \"like\" buildings and street vendors. I remember looking at the USA side and thought \" that is probably soooo boring, like \u2026",

The lights that come on at sunset really brings it all together. The roaring Niagara river will definitely leave a great impression on you!",

          "It had been years since we\u2019ve been to Niagara Falls and turn her last visit we only visited the Canadian side. The US side is terrific the Niagara State Park and facilities were some of the best we\u2019ve seen anywhere. If use are unique and something we hadn\u2019t seen before so we had a great time.",
          "Beautiful fall day at the Falls. Can't believe the beauty of God's gift.  Trolley ride is inexpensive and the driver is full of knowledge about the Falls. I highly recommend it for one or all.",
          "Incredible,  best part is that you don't have to spend a lot of money.  You can pay $1,25 to go on the observation deck and take the elevator to the base of the falls and get great picture right next to the falls.  You are so close you feel the most and the power of the falls!",
          "I went here a couple of days ago and I love it. It is a great place to get exercise and spent time with family or a loved one.  There were signs everywhere helping you. The view was great except there are always people crowding around the \u2026",

          "Besides all the illegal immigrants it's a good place I visited my first time in March 2019 and it's a beautiful site to see. You can see Canada literally feet away.",
          "What an amazing place. Only went to Canada side in the past and it\u2019s way too commercialized. VERY accommodating to EV charging",
          "This is one of my favorite places to be. I'm so blessed to have the falls in my backyard. Its so calming and relaxing even with tourist(best at night) they have a light show, the falls light up different colors, perfect: date night, alone \u2026",
          "Great place for a date or a family outing . Bring a picnic or have a nice time at the restaurants eating great food.",
          "There's at least one good spot for observation that's still free on the American side. The park has been getting dug up for years to improve it. As of 2019 it still has a long way to go. It's surrounded by pricey tour and viewing options. I \u2026",
          "First off this place is huge, would be a great workout to just walk through all of it, although would recommend the trolley for efficiency. The view of the Niagara falls overall, the horseshoe falls and the American falls is spectacular. \u2026",
          "You beauty. I use to think its one fall but there are 3 falls and all of them awesome. Both mist tour and boat tour which takes next to falls is awesome.",
          "One of natural wonders of the word. Well maintained and improved by the authority to attract tourists world over. Representation by movie of the history of Niagra in theaters. Ethnic shuttle bus to move to the various points of observation, \u2026",
          "beautiful.  clean.  not busy at all when we went.",
          "The cave of the winds and boat ride were great. Would like to come here next year as well",
          "Any day Any time i will visit this place for the beauty of falls and other attraction around. However, the park authorities need to focus on crowd management and better way to issue ticket and get the admission to attractions like Maid of \u2026",

          "Beautiful, majestic and breathtaking! Once in a lifetime experience that you will never forget. The staff of the Niagara Falls State Park was very friendly and professional!",
          "Was a great place to finally see.  Worth stopping by to check off your bucket list.  Definitely not a destination in my opinion.  If you are driving through, it is worth going an hour out of your way to see the falls, but I would not recommend making anything more than a day trip out of it."

          "Visited the museum some time ago and it was great, but perhaps their most interesting exhibit isn't housed in the main building at all. One of the pivotal events in Buffalo history was its hosting of the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. Buffalo rightly thought that this event",

          "We went on free third Fridays, which was awesome (Every third Friday of the month is free). The views are great and the building itself is gorgeous and has so much history. I enjoyed the Tim Russert office exhibit. The neighbors section is great. I look forward to the exhibit",
          "I visited with my 12 year old daughter and 7 year old son. The museum is housed in a beautiful building. I really liked the Tim Russert exhibit, however I was underwhelmed by much of the rest. There were a lot of words describing the rich history of Buffalo but I can get that",
          "We were on a trip to Niagara Falls in September, and it was pouring rain, so we opted to day-trip it down to Buffalo. Had a buy-one get one entry coupon - so thought - why not? (it's not really expensive anyway --- only about $7 per person) Was glad I did, even though one of",

          "I would recommend this Museum if you're a Buffalo Native, or just really want to learn more about Buffalo. The building is 3 floors and there is a lot of really cool historical stuff. The gift shop also have tons of Buffalo theme gifts. You got a a couple of hours to to kill, I",
          "More than expected. The exhibits display a great range of the history of Buffalo, spanning 150 years of development and evolution. The timeline of immigration to today was enlightening. Buffalo is truly a melting pot. The Victorian Streets downstairs make you feel like you",
          "Nice Historical Museum to visit in the Buffalo, NY area. Exibits are informative, but still has a lot to offer. Building is old and historic could use a renovation. History of the area is described in various exhibits and very interesting.",
          "Many diverse moments in Buffalo history are here--Tim Russart of PBS fame (I think it was PBS), the sickening history of what happened to the Indian tribes, lots of information and exhibits on the War of !812, plus shops like they would have been \"back then\" and finally a train",
          "The museum is in the process of being renovated, but still has a lot to offer. The Indian influence and the population boom due to the industrial influences. Some old relics notable for a history museum. The Japanese along the river front was a nice walk that allows you to get",

          "This is obvious, just by the beauty of the building and surrounding area. Buffalo, NY was THE place to be back in the early 1900's, due to the Erie Canal. Many millionaires once lived here and this building is the last standing structure that was used during the 1901 Pan",
          "Housed in a century old building, the only one left from the Pan-American Buffalo Exhibition in 1901, this museum is physically extremely lovely. It has a unique gift shop and some of the staff were enthusiastic and happy to \"talk shop\", others, not so much. The exhibits",
          "This museum has it all. There are great exhibits that highlight Buffalo's rich history and character, interactive exhibits for children, great information on the Pan American Exposition of 1901 and the assassination of President McKinley, a scenic view on a lake, its proximity",
          "On a recent trip to visit Buffalo's architectural highlights we decided to visit this historc site. The NY pavillion for the 1901 World's Fair, this beautiful building now houses a neat collection of local historical artifacts - Filmore's coach, the gun used by McKinley's",
          "I've been visiting this museum, first as a resident of Buffalo and now as a returning visitor, for about 60 years. It is continually being improved and enhanced. The exhibits will appeal to every age. They have even added a little 'frontier home' where young children can",
          "If you are a history buff and want to learn more about the Erie Canal, the world's fair and the assasination on McKinley this is a great place to go. There is an air of mystery that surrounds the place, it only adds to the charm. I've been going since childhood and still love",
          "This museum is worth a stop for 90 minutes or so, especially if you're interested in Buffalo history. Beautiful architecture. I went yesterday & they had an exhibit on Red Jacket, (the Seneca Indian orator). Also very interesting is the permanent exhibits which tell about"

      "name": "Horseshoe Falls",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Niagara Falls  is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls are separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.\nLocated on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres (160 ft). During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3  (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.The falls are 27 kilometres (17 mi) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) south-southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.\nNiagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Horseshoe Falls drop about 57 metres (187 ft), while the height of the American Falls varies between 21 and 30 metres (69 and 98 ft) because of the presence of giant boulders at its base. The larger Horseshoe Falls are about 790 metres (2,590 ft) wide, while the American Falls are 320 metres (1,050 ft) wide. The distance between the American extremity of the Niagara Falls and the Canadian extremity is 3,409 feet (1,039 m).\nThe peak flow over Horseshoe Falls was recorded at 6,400 cubic metres (230,000 cu ft) per second. The average annual flow rate is 2,400 cubic metres (85,000 cu ft) per second. Since the flow is a direct function of the Lake Erie water elevation, it typically peaks in late spring or early summer. During the summer months, at least 2,800 cubic metres (99,000 cu ft) per second of water traverses the falls, some 90% of which goes over the Horseshoe Falls, while the balance is diverted to hydroelectric facilities. This is accomplished by employing a weir \u2013 the International Control Dam \u2013 with movable gates upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. \n\n \nThe falls' flow is further halved at night, and, during the low tourist season in the winter, remains a minimum of 1,400 cubic metres (49,000 cu ft) per second. Water diversion is regulated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty and is administered by the International Niagara Board of Control (IJC). The verdant green color of the water flowing over the Niagara Falls is a byproduct of the estimated 60 tonnes/minute of dissolved salts and \"rock flour\" (very finely ground rock) generated by the erosive force of the Niagara River itself.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin, Lake Chicago, Glacial Lake Iroquois, and Champlain Sea) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today. Scientists argue there is an old valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.\n\nWhen the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and dolomite of the Lockport Formation. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall. Immediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two-thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient fossils. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.\nSubmerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper Ordovician), which is composed of shales and fine sandstones. All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.\n\nAbout 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately 6.8 miles (10.9 km) southward. The Horseshoe Falls, which are about 2,600 feet (790 m) wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic V. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the mostly Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.The current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters (1 ft) per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m (3 ft) per year. According to the timeline of the far future, in roughly 50,000 years Niagara Falls will have eroded the remaining 32 kilometres (20 mi) to Lake Erie and cease to exist.\n\n\n=== Preservation efforts ===\nIn the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.\n\nGoat Island was one of the inspirations for the American side of the effort. William Dorsheimer, moved by the scene from the island, brought Olmsted to Buffalo in 1868 to design a city park system and helped promote Olmsted's career. In 1879, the New York state legislature commissioned Olmsted and James T. Gardner to survey the falls and to create the single most important document in the Niagara preservation movement, a Special Report on the preservation of Niagara Falls. The report advocated for State purchase, restoration and preservation through public ownership of the scenic lands surrounding Niagara Falls. Restoring the former beauty of the falls was described in the report as a \"sacred obligation to mankind.\" In 1883, New York Governor Grover Cleveland drafted legislation authorizing acquisition of lands for a state reservation at Niagara, and the Niagara Falls Association, a private citizens group founded in 1882, mounted a great letter-writing campaign and petition drive in support of the park. Professor Charles Eliot Norton and Olmsted were among the leaders of the public campaign, while New York Governor Alonzo Cornell opposed.Preservationists' efforts were rewarded on April 30, 1885, when Governor David B. Hill signed legislation creating the Niagara Reservation, New York's first state park. New York State began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the Niagara Reservation State Park. In the same year, the province of Ontario established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. On the Canadian side, the Niagara Parks Commission governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.In 1887, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux issued a supplemental report detailing plans to restore the falls. Their intent was \"to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto,\" and the report anticipated fundamental questions. How would preservationists provide access without destroying the beauty of the falls? How would they restore natural landscapes damaged by man? They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls. Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive to strike a balance between Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.Preservation efforts continued well into the 20th century. J. Horace McFarland, the Sierra Club, and the Appalachian Mountain Club persuaded the United States Congress in 1906 to enact legislation to preserve the falls by regulating the waters of the Niagara River. The act sought, in cooperation with the Canadian government, to restrict diversion of water, and a treaty resulted in 1909 that limited the total amount of water diverted from the falls by both nations to approximately 56,000 cubic feet (1,600 m3) per second. That limitation remained in effect until 1950.\n\nErosion control efforts have always been of extreme importance. Underwater weirs redirect the most damaging currents, and the top of the falls has also been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted from the American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam. During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including a man who had been seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried.While the Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of talus deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was dynamited, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, Luna Island, the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge.\n\nCommercial interests have continued to encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study indicated it has caused the airflow near the falls to change direction. Students at the University of Guelph demonstrated, using scale models, that as air passes over the top of the new hotels it causes a breeze to roll down the south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The inference was that a documented rise in the number of \"mist days\" was a result of these breezes, where mist days refers to the mist plume of the falls reaching landside. In 1996 there were 29 mist days recorded, but by 2003 that number had risen to 68. Another study has discounted this opinion and linked mist production to the difference in air and water temperature at the falls. However, this study does not offer opinion as to why mist days have been increasing, just that the hotel breezes are an unlikely cause.In 2013, New York State began an effort to renovate The Sisters Islands located on Goat Island. New York State used funds from the re-licensing of the New York Power Authority hydroelectric plant downriver in Lewiston, New York, to rebuild walking paths on the Three Sisters Islands and to plant native vegetation on the islands. The state also renovated the area around Prospect Point at the brink of the American Falls in the state park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTheories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area. According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Onguiaahra, meaning \"point of land cut in two\".Henry Schoolcraft reported:\n\nNiagara Falls. This name is Mohawk. It means, according to Mrs. Kerr, the neck; the term being first applied to the portage or neck of land, between lakes Erie and Ontario. By referring to Mr. Elliott's vocabulary, (chapter xi) it will be seen that the human neck, that is, according to the concrete vocabulary, his neck, is onyara. Red Jacket pronounced the word Niagara to me, in the spring of 1820, as if written O-ne-au-ga-rah.\n\nMany figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman Samuel de Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals. The Finnish-Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls. The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary Louis Hennepin, who observed and described the falls in 1677, earlier than Kalm, after traveling with the explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. Further complicating matters, there is credible evidence the French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin's visit while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada. Jean de Br\u00e9beuf also may have visited the falls, while spending time with the Neutral Nation.\n\nIn 1762, Captain Thomas Davies, a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the area and painted the watercolor, An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara, the first eyewitness painting of the falls.During the 19th century, tourism became popular, and by mid-century, it was the area's main industry. Theodosia Burr Alston (daughter of Vice President Aaron Burr) and her husband Joseph Alston were the first recorded couple to honeymoon there in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me visited with his bride in the early 19th century.In 1825, British explorer John Franklin visited the falls while passing through New York en route to Cumberland House as part of his second Arctic expedition, calling them \"so justly celebrated as the first in the world for grandeur\".In March 1848, an ice blockage caused the falls to stop; no water (or at best a trickle) fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, and mills and factories shut down for having no power.\n\nLater that year, demand for passage over the Niagara River led to the building of a footbridge and then Charles Ellet's Niagara Suspension Bridge. This was supplanted by German-born John Augustus Roebling's Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in 1855. After the American Civil War, the New York Central Railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, it carries passenger vehicles and trains between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just downstream of the falls.\nIn about 1840, the English industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson traveled to Canada, stopping at the Niagara Falls long enough to make the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate No\u00ebl Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841\u20131864).On 6 August 1918, an iron scow became stuck on the rocks above the falls. The two men on the scow were rescued but the vessel remained trapped on rocks in the river, and is still visible there in a deteriorate state, although its position shifted by 50 meters during a storm on 31 October 2019. Daredevil William \"Red\" Hill Sr. was particularly praised for his role in the rescue.\n\nAfter the First World War, tourism boomed again, as automobiles made getting to the falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the falls for hydroelectric power, and to control the development on both sides that threaten the area's natural beauty. In 1941, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission completed the third current crossing in the immediate area of Niagara Falls with the Rainbow Bridge, carrying both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the two countries and Canadian and U.S. customs for each country.\nBefore the late 20th century, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, 400 ft (120 m) of the Horseshoe Falls were eliminated, including 100 ft (30 m) on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada. Other sources say \"most of\" Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.\n\n\n=== History of freezing over ===\n\nThe only recorded freeze-up of the river and falls was due to an ice jam on March 29, 1848. In 1912, the American Falls was completely frozen but the other two kept flowing. Although the falls commonly ice up most winters, the river and the falls do not freeze completely. The years 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014, 2017 and 2019 are noted for partial freezing of the falls.A so-called ice bridge was also common in certain years at the base of the falls and was used by people who wanted to cross the river before bridges had been built. During some winters, the ice sheet was as thick as 40 feet (12m) to 100 feet (30m) but that thickness has not occurred since 1954. The ice bridge of 1841 was said to be at least 100 feet thick.   \n On 12 February 1912, the ice bridge which had formed on 15 January began breaking up while people were still on it. Many escaped but three died during the event, later named the Ice Bridge Disaster or Tragedy.\n\n\n=== History of the bridges ===\n\nA number of bridges have spanned the Niagara River in the general vicinity of the falls. The first, not far from the Whirlpool, was a suspension bridge above the gorge. It opened for use by the public in July 1848 and remained in use until 1855. A second bridge in the Upper Falls area was commissioned, with two levels or decks, one for use by the Great Western Railway. This Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge opened in 1855. In 1882, the Grand Trunk Railway took over control of the second deck after it absorbed the Great Western company. Significant structural improvements were made in the late 1870s and then in 1886; this bridge remained in use until 1897.Due to the volume of traffic, the decision was made to construct a new arch bridge nearby: under and around the existing bridge. After it opened in September 1897, a decision was made to remove and scrap the Railway Suspension Bridge. This new bridge was initially known as the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge; it had two decks, the lower one used for carriages and the upper for trains. In 1937, it was renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge and remains in use today. All of the structures built up to that time were referred to as Lower Niagara bridges and were some distance from the falls.\n\nThe first bridge in the so-called Upper Niagara area (closer to the falls) was a two level suspension structure that opened in January 1869; it was destroyed during a severe storm in January 1889. The replacement was built quickly and opened in May of the same year. In order to handle heavy traffic a second bridge was commissioned, slightly closer to the American Falls. This one was fully made of steel and opened to traffic in June 1897; it was known as the Upper Steel Arch Bridge, but was often called the Honeymoon Bridge. The single level included a track for trolleys and space for carriages and pedestrians. The design led to the bridge being very close to the surface of the river and in January, 1938, an ice jam twisted the steel frame of the bridge which later collapsed, on January 27, 1938.\n\nAnother Lower Niagara bridge had been commissioned in 1883 by Cornelius Vanderbilt for use by railways at a location roughly approximately 200 feet south of the Railway Suspension Bridge. This one was of an entirely different design; it was a Cantilever bridge to provide greater strength. The Niagara Cantilever Bridge had two cantilevers which were joined by steel sections; it opened officially in December 1883 and improvements were made over the years for a stronger structure. As rail traffic was increasing, the Michigan Central Railroad company decided to build a new bridge in 1923, to be located between the Lower Steel Arch Bridge and the Cantilever Bridge. The Michigan Central Railway Bridge opened in February 1925 and remained in use until the early 21st century. The Cantilever Bridge was removed and scrapped after the new rail bridge opened. Nonetheless, it was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in 2006.There was a lengthy dispute as to which agency should build the replacement for the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge in the Upper Niagara area. When that was resolved, construction of a steel bridge commenced in February 1940. Named the Rainbow Bridge, and featuring two lanes for traffic separated by a barrier, this one opened in November 1941. It remains in use today.\n\n\n== Impact on industry and commerce ==\n\n\n=== Hydroelectric power ===\n\nThe enormous energy of Niagara Falls has long been recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1759, when Daniel Joncaire built a small canal above the falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide hydraulic power for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals that would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob F. Schoellkopf, the Niagara River's first hydroelectric generating station was built. The water fell 86 feet (26 m) and generated direct current electricity, which ran the machinery of local mills and lit up some of the village streets.\nThe Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract Company headed by Edward Dean Adams, with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' power capacity. In 1890, a five-member International Niagara Commission headed by Sir William Thomson among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals, but could not select any as the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, Westinghouse Electric (which had built the smaller-scale Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant near Ophir, Colorado, two years earlier) was hired to design a system to generate alternating current on Niagara Falls, and three years after that this large-scale AC power system was created (activated on August 26, 1895). The Adams Power Plant Transformer House remains as a landmark of the original system.\n\nBy 1896, financing from moguls including J.P. Morgan, John Jacob Astor IV, and the Vanderbilts had fueled the construction of giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of 100,000 horsepower (75 MW), sent as far as Buffalo, 20 miles (32 km) away. Some of the original designs for the power transmission plants were created by the Swiss firm Faesch & Piccard, which also constructed the original 5,000 hp waterwheels.\nPrivate companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the falls. The Government of Ontario eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province.\nOther hydropower plants were also being built along the Niagara River. But in 1956, disaster struck when the region's largest hydropower station was partially destroyed in a landslide. This drastically reduced power production and put tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs at stake. In 1957, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act, which granted the New York Power Authority the right to fully develop the United States' share of the Niagara River's hydroelectric potential.In 1961, when the Niagara Falls hydroelectric project went online, it was the largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 GW. Up to 1,420 cubic metres (380,000 US gal) of water a second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the Lewiston and Robert Moses power plants. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through hydroelectric turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls. This water spins turbines that power generators, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. When electrical demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.To preserve Niagara Falls' natural beauty, a 1950 treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada limited water usage by the power plants. The treaty allows higher summertime diversion at night when tourists are fewer and during the winter months when there are even fewer tourists. This treaty, designed to ensure an \"unbroken curtain of water\" flowing over the falls, states that during daylight time during the tourist season (April 1 to October 31) there must be 100,000 cubic feet per second (2,800 m3/s) of water flowing over the falls, and during the night and off-tourist season there must be 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,400 m3/s) of water flowing over the falls. This treaty is monitored by the International Niagara Board of Control, using a NOAA gauging station above the falls. During winter, the Power Authority of New York works with Ontario Power Generation to prevent ice on the Niagara River from interfering with power production or causing flooding of shoreline property. One of their joint efforts is an 8,800-foot-long (2,700 m) ice boom, which prevents the buildup of ice, yet allows water to continue flowing downstream. In addition to minimum water volume, the crest of the Horseshoe falls was reduced to maintain an uninterrupted \"curtain of water.\"\n\nThe most powerful hydroelectric stations on the Niagara River are the Sir Adam Beck 1 and 2 on the Canadian side and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant on the American side. Together, Niagara's generating stations can produce about 4.4 gigawatts of power.\nIn August 2005 Ontario Power Generation, which is responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, started a major civil engineering project, called the Niagara Tunnel Project, to increase power production by building a new 12.7-metre (42 ft) diameter, 10.2-kilometre-long (6.3 mi) water diversion tunnel. It was officially placed into service in March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's nameplate capacity by 150 megawatts. It did so by tapping water from farther up the Niagara River than was possible with the preexisting arrangement. The tunnel provided new hydroelectricity for approximately 160,000 homes.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nShips can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the Welland Canal, which was improved and incorporated into the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby Buffalo and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished with the help of the electric power produced by the river. However, since the 1970s the region has declined economically.\nThe cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges. The Rainbow Bridge, just downriver from the falls, affords the closest view of the falls and is open to non-commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians. The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge lies one mile (1.6 km) north of the Rainbow Bridge and is the oldest bridge over the Niagara River. Nearby Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport were named after the waterfall, as were Niagara University, countless local businesses, and even an asteroid.\n\n\n== Over the falls ==\n\n\n=== Jumps, plunges and walks ===\n\nIn October 1829, Sam Patch, who called himself \"the Yankee Leapster\", jumped from a high tower into the gorge below the falls and survived; this began a long tradition of daredevils trying to go over the falls.\nEnglishman Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel, drowned in 1883 trying to swim the rapids downriver from the falls.On October 24, 1901, 63-year-old Michigan school teacher Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to go over the falls in a barrel as a publicity stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, \"No one ought ever do that again.\" Before Taylor's attempt, on October 19 her domestic cat named Iagara was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength. Contrary to rumours at the time, the cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs. Since Taylor's historic ride, over a dozen people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is now illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls.\n\nBobby Leach went over the Horseshoe Falls in a crude steel barrel in 1911, and needed rescuing by William \"Red\" Hill Sr.. Hill would again come to the rescue of Leach following his failed attempt to swim the Niagara Gorge in 1920.\nIn 1918, there was a near disaster when a barge working upriver, known locally as the Niagara Scow, broke its tow line and almost plunged over the falls. The two workers on board saved themselves by grounding the vessel on rocks just short of the falls, where it has remained ever since. \"Red\" Hill was credited with the rescue of the two boatmen. In October 2019, as a result of inclement weather, the Niagara Scow finally moved from its original resting place, moving closer to the brink of Horseshoe Falls.In 1928, \"Smiling Jean\" Lussier tried an entirely different concept, going over the falls in a large rubber ball; he was successful and survived the ordeal.Charles Stephens, a 58-year-old barber from Bristol, England, went over the falls in a wooden barrel in July 1920 and was the first person to die in an endeavor of this type.\n\nIn the \"Miracle at Niagara\", Roger Woodward, a seven-year-old American boy, was swept over the Horseshoe Falls after their boat lost power on July 9, 1960; two tourists pulled his 17-year-old sister Deanne from the river only 20 feet (6.1 m) from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island. Minutes later, Woodward was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath the Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the Maid of the Mist boat. The third person who had been in the boat, James Hunicutt, did not survive the mishap.On July 2, 1984, Canadian Karel Soucek from Hamilton, Ontario, plunged over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined $500 for performing the stunt without a license. In 1985, he was fatally injured while attempting to re-create the Niagara drop at the Houston Astrodome. His aim was to climb into a barrel hoisted to the rafters of the Astrodome and to drop 180 feet (55 m) into a water tank on the floor. After his barrel released prematurely, it hit the side of the tank and he died the next day from his injuries.\n\nIn August 1985, Steve Trotter, an aspiring stuntman from Rhode Island, became the youngest person ever (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the falls again, becoming the second person to go over the falls twice and survive. It was also the second-ever \"duo\"; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the falls. They survived the fall but their barrel became stuck at the bottom of the falls, requiring a rescue.On September 28, 1989, Niagara natives Peter DeBernardi (age 42) and Jeffery James Petkovich (age 25) became the first \"team\" to make it over the falls in a two-person barrel. The stunt was conceived by DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. The pair emerged shortly after going over with minor injuries and were charged with performing an illegal stunt under the Niagara Parks Act.On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a whitewater canoeist from Tennessee paddled over the falls in a closed deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics at the base of the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.On September 27, 1993, John \"David\" Munday, of Caistor Centre, Ontario, completed his second journey over the falls.On October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas \"Firecracker\" Overacker went over the falls on a Jet Ski to raise awareness for the homeless. His rocket-propelled parachute failed to open and he plunged to his death. Overacker's body was recovered before he was pronounced dead at Niagara General Hospital.Kirk Jones of Canton, Michigan, became the first known person to survive a plunge over the Horseshoe Falls without a flotation device on October 20, 2003. According to some reports, Jones had attempted to commit suicide, he survived the 16-story fall with only battered ribs, scrapes, and bruises. Jones tried going over the falls again in 2017, this time, using a large inflatable ball, but died in the process. Later reports revealed that Jones had arranged for a friend to shoot video clips of his stunt.\n\nOn March 11, 2009, a man survived an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls, and when rescued from the river, was reported to be suffering from severe hypothermia and a large wound to his head. His identity was never released. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the man intentionally enter the water.On May 21, 2012, an unidentified man in his early 40s became the fourth person to survive an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls. Eyewitness reports show he \"deliberately jumped\" into the Niagara River after climbing over a railing.On July 8, 2019, at roughly 4 am, officers responded to a report of a person in crisis at the brink of the Canadian side of the falls. Once officers got to the scene, the man climbed the retaining wall, jumped into the river and went over the Horseshoe Falls. Authorities subsequently began to search the lower Niagara River basin, where the man was found sitting on the rocks at the water's edge.\n\nOther daredevils have made crossing the gorge their goal, starting with the successful passage by Jean Fran\u00e7ois \"Blondin\" Gravelet, who crossed Niagara Gorge in 1859. Between 1859 and 1896 a wire-walking craze emerged, resulting in frequent feats over the river below the falls. One inexperienced walker slid down his safety rope. Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.Maria Spelterini, a 23-year-old Italian was the first and only woman to cross the Niagara River gorge; she did so on a tightrope, on 8 July 1876. She repeated the stunt several times during the same month. During one crossing she was blindfolded and during another, her ankles and wrists were handcuffed.The tightrope walkers drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself. Blondin made his first gorge crossing on a tightrope on 30 June 1859 and did so again eight times that year. His most difficult crossing occurred on August 14, when he carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back.   His final crossing, on 8 September 1860, was witnessed by the Prince of Wales.Among the many competitors was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as \"The Great Farini\"; his first crossing was in 1860. Farini competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge. On 8 August  1864 however, an attempt failed and he needed to be rescued.On 15 June 2012, high wire artist Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk across the falls area in 116 years, after receiving special permission from both governments. The full length of his tightrope was 1,800 feet (550 m). Wallenda crossed near the brink of the Horseshoe Falls, unlike walkers who had crossed farther downstream. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it upon arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nPeak visitor traffic occurs in the summertime, when Niagara Falls are both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the falls for several hours after dark (until midnight). The number of visitors in 2007 was expected to total 20 million, and by 2009 the annual rate was expected to top 28 million tourists.The oldest and best known tourist attraction at Niagara Falls is the Maid of the Mist boat cruise, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, which has carried passengers into the rapids immediately below the falls since 1846. Cruise boats operate from boat docks on both sides of the falls, with the Maid of the Mist operating from the American side and Hornblower Cruises (originally Maid of the Mist until 2014) from the Canadian side.From the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Observation Tower and a boat dock for the Maid of the Mist. Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls. From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a statue of Nikola Tesla (the inventor whose patents for the AC induction motor and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls. Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park.\n\nThe Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed by helicopter. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe. The Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the United Office Building in the 1920s.On the Canadian side, Queen Victoria Park features manicured gardens, platforms offering views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. Along the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs 35 miles (56 km) from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the War of 1812.\n\nThe observation deck of the nearby Skylon Tower offers the highest view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as Toronto. Along with the Tower Hotel (built as the Seagrams Tower, later renamed the Heritage Tower, the Royal Inn Tower, the Royal Center Tower, the Panasonic Tower, the Minolta Tower, and most recently the Konica Minolta Tower before receiving its current name in 2010), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls.The Whirlpool Aero Car, built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, is a cable car that takes passengers over the Niagara Whirlpool on the Canadian side. The Journey Behind the Falls consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.There are two casinos on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Movies and television ===\n\nAlready a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of Niagara, a movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten.The 1956 animated short Niagara Fools featured Woody Woodpecker attempting to go over the falls in a barrel. The falls was a featured location in the major motion picture Superman II in 1980, and was itself the subject of a popular IMAX movie, Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic. Illusionist David Copperfield performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1990.The falls, or more particularly, the tourist-supported complex near the falls, was the setting of the short-lived Canadian-shot US television show Wonderfalls in early 2004. Location footage of the falls was shot in October 2006 to portray \"World's End\" of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Professional kayaker Rafa Ortiz's preparation to paddle over the falls in a kayak is documented in the 2015 film Chasing Niagara.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nComposer Ferde Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Niagara Falls Power Generation project in 1960 to compose the Niagara Falls Suite in honor of the completion of the first stage of hydroelectric work at the falls. In 1997, composer Michael Daugherty composed Niagara Falls, a piece for concert band inspired by the falls.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Niagara Falls area features as the base camp for a German aerial invasion of the United States in the H. G. Wells novel The War in the Air.Many poets have been inspired to write about the falls. Among them was the Cuban poet Jos\u00e9 Maria Heredia, who wrote the poem \"Niagara\". There are commemorative plaques on both sides of the falls recognising the poem.In the original 1920s and 1930s Buck Rogers stories and newspaper cartoons, Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on Earth.Part of Mark Twain's 1893 short story, \"Extract from Adam's Diary\" is set at Niagara Falls.The Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov portrays the impressiveness of the Niagara Falls in his book, To Chicago and Back.\nIn 2014, the writer Alessandro Baricco published the book Smith & Wesson recounting the story of Rachel Green going over the falls.\n\n\n== Fine art ==\nThe Niagara Falls were such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were \"the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Panoramic views ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederal Power Commission v.

The view from the Canadian side is definitely better as you can get beautiful wide shots during the day and the light show at night changing the color of the falls",

          "both are very beautiful but they are crowded with people, you can see it clearly if you wait because you can stand by the railings and it is even better when the colored LED lights are on at night, but bring a rain coat and park in a parking lot not really close to the falls because it is cheaper and good exercise.",

Be sure to walk the length of the sidewalk next to the Falls and ride the giant Sky wheel",

          "I was on the NY side like 2 decades ago, this time from the Canada side.  Both have great views.  The sound of the water is surprisingly relaxing if you take a minute to just listen to the water and tone out everything else.  I enjoyed my trip there.",
          "Probably the most famous falls in North America, Niagara Falls is absolutely unique and among the most extraordinary falls in the world. We could have stayed and gazed there for hours to admire the magnificence of this natural wonder. We also took the boat to see them from below where the falls reach the bottom. Highly recommended.",
          "You have to see it to believe it. And be sure to walk right to the point where the water tumbles down: you can almost feel yourself tumbling down with it. Of course it has to be viewed on the Canadian side, therr is so much more to see!",
          "Best experience EVER! I've never seen anything more beautiful tha Niagara falls, and the cave of the winds, and maid of the mist added to to this great experience. I can't wait to come back next year!!!",
          "One of the excellent place in the earth to see. People coming to Toronto or near by must come to this place and enjoy the beauty of nature.",
          "I wanted go down to the river level but everything is closed and gated off.",
          "Worth a visit at any time of year. The National Parks Service does an excellent job maintaining the  gardens surrounding the falls.",
          "What can I say it's one of the seven wonders of the new world.\n\nWe stayed at the Hilton on the Canadian side with a view of both the American and the Canadian Falls the lights the fireworks at night if you've never been you have to go to Niagara Falls warrants then there's so many things to do",
          "Weather was good.  Not too crowded. Falls still impressive. Traffic wasn't too heavy. There were quite a few places to park. Most parking is pay at a meter cash or credit card. I don't think the machines take paper bills.",
          "Incredible views. It was freezing when we were there which made it very atmospheric",
          "Great view, the amazing power of the Falls is astonishing. Amazing natural wonder. Experience it up close, it is something to see in your lifetime",
          "Amazing place to have a look",
          "Impressive scenery, better than I could imagine. Maid of the mist excursion was a blast. Bus transportation between points of interest was exceptional. Surrounding countryside was verdant. Enjoyed wineries and fruitstands.",
          "Absolutely in love with the Niagara Falls. It was on my bucket list and didn't disappoint.",
          "What a magnificent falls. One can never get bored even after watching it for hours. One item off my bucket list. \ud83d\ude0e Night view with colourful lights was wonderful. Morning it was even more breathtaking.",
          "Beautiful waterfall. Need to see it from both sides to truly appreciate its beauty.",
          "Not busy thanks to COVID. Not much is open but the falls are beautiful.",
          "Niagara Falls or Horseshoe falls is an amazing sight to see. The strong and powerful falls falling onto the rocks below with the mist battering down on your light jackets and sweaters that you need to wear because of the generally cooler \u2026",
          "Does Niagara even need a review!? Really amazing and glorious. I guess the Canadian side which we tried has better views. If it's a rainy day then the cruises that take you under the falls might not work due to the high rise water. Try to walk along so you get to see different view and angles.",
          "Beautiful views. Great visitor's center. Modern and clean.",
          "Some of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world. While the US side is a State Park well preserved, the Canadian side is pitiful, full of hotel towers. A shame. Instead of a Great Canyon Park you have a kind of Disneyland theme park. A disgrace from a conservationist perspective.",
          "must visit place if your a tourist. I thought it was quite a romantic spot. I didn't do the boating tour that takes you near the falls up close and personal. nevertheless it was an awesome sight to behold as always. I felt the raw power of nature and its beauty.",
          "Never ceases to amaze.  Always a wonderful feeling looking at the beautiful falls.  There's no street parking, visitors can park at the nearby public parking (just follow the signs) at CAD$20 per entry and a very short distance from the falls.  There seems to be less visitors during winter months compared to summer.",
          "Lots to do, eat, and see. Even if you visit all the time, there is always something new to check out and a new experience to be had. The falls are absolutely beautiful and a must see",
          "One of my favorite places to go and relax. Always find something g to do",
          "You will enjoy I promise.  Go in the Winter time when the trees are iced up beautiful",
          "This place is always crowded, unbelievable!\nGood place to visit with family. Canada side is visited more compare to the US side",
          "Best trip I've ever did. Take advantage of the discovery pass, will give you access to the horseshoe, the cave of the winds, the theater and the aquarium. This pass is a bargain!",
          "A once in a lifetime experience, we walked the tunnels which wasn't as good as Maid Of The Mist but still added to the trip, maid of the mist is a must do while here, amazing photography opportunity and a brilliant couple of days spent at the falls.",
          "One of the best falls that everybody must put it in his or her bucket list to visit, it is beyond imagination .",
          "This place is full of fun and exciting things to see and do. The ride to the falls was wet and cool. I can't wait to come back again!",
          "It's nice to see. I must say there is so much hype around it that I was only impressed when I was reallly close. Otherwise I thought it was larger. But definitely good to see.",
          "phenomenal view. the power of the watefall is awe inspiring. highly recommend taking a boat trip to under the fall then you can experience it all",
          "One of the most amazingly beautiful places in the world. The rushing of the falls sounds like ocean waves. This are is very touristy, so you will spend a lot of money here. It's a great weekend destination.",
          "Been there 20times spent a lot of money but well worth the family time",
          "Visited this place recently and the view of the falls is breathtaking. You can walk and go very close to the water on the American side. Also the boat ride takes you very close to the falls. Should visit this place at least once every \u2026",
          "Amazing boat trip !\ud83e\udd32",
          "Beautiful place and it's for sure a must visit. The weather was amazing too, I saw rainbows and the complete experience was very delightful and rewarding. The one thing that I couldn't find was a water fountain to drink/fill water.",
          "Have been in the spring summer and fall. Now the winter. Nice. Not crowded. Not as of you are going to swim anyway...",
          "Less people but still good place to go.",
          "Stunning. Lots to do here from zip line to boat trip.",
          "Greatest Wonder in The World",
          "This was a very beautiful experience that I think everyone should have. The falls were as gourgous as they were massive. There is many different experiences you can have on the Canadian side, some are better then others. The American side \u2026",
          "I loved it \u2764\ufe0f It was a just a beautiful view. The only thing that is was way too hot. If you don't like high temperatures I recommend you don't visit in August. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
          "The falls is one of its kind. Took the boat ride and experienced the horseshoe falls. It was mind blowing to see the huge fall so near.",
          "The Canadian side way much better than the American side.",
          "I can go every year and never be tired. I love Niagara Falls and the city.",
          "Nice to see again.  Looked different in winter.  Great day.",
          "It is very stunning in person. It was my dream to visit it, and it did not disappoint. You can really feel the power of the falls even if you're far from it. We took the boat to go near the falls and it was definitely the highlight of our trip.",
          "Who doesnt love this natural splendour and beauty.  Parents were very happy after this trip. Really a natural wonder...",
          "Great experience. Definitely worth doing the boat trip to the horse shoe - every little step of it. Also there is a great view for photos from the street just above the falls but below the many hotels.",
          "Amazing view and love the Nikola Tesla tie in.   Currently catching up on all the shows on Tesla, Edison,  Westinghouse and JP Morgan.",
          "This is the best!!!!\nTottally loved the place.\nThe view from here is amazing\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
          "One of the best examples of my life! It's impressive. And I'm glad that I had the chance to check it from Canada and also from USA.",
          "A must see!! Walking along the river while enjoying the falls is an incredible experience. At night, the lights on the falls make you feel you are in a fairy tale. I recommend taking the boat to see them from closer.",
          "It's a stunning place to see and a definite bucket list item however there's very little to do in the area when your there off season (winter).",
          "First time in Niagara Falls. Beautiful area. Beautiful view of the falls. Very busy but easy enough to find parking. Lot's of $25 for the day/night lots around. Would definitely go back!",
          "WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AND FACILITIES \nJUST LOVED IT\nWILL COME AGAIN",
          "Absolutely BEAUTIFUL experience! Took the Hornblower cruise and loved every minute of it! My family and I got soaked even with the ponchos they provide but it was a blast. Will definitely be returning!",
          "I believe Niagara Falls should be the 8th wonder of the world because of the magnificence of it. The beauty it brings to it's surroundings and the power it show the earth has is amazing. The advise I would give though is that the only way to get a good view of it is by seeing it on the Canadian side, where you can see it straight on.",
          "Beautiful nature, although it's unfortunate how it's become a money machine with boats going up and down constantly. The outskirts of town around the Niagara falls are very rough.",
          "A great location a truly once in a life time experience. The fireworks at night are brilliant",
          "Always spectacular \u2763\ufe0f",
          "The best experience. Everyone should experience this what a great adventure it was.",
          "This massive wall of water is something to behold, and worth the trip. There are some great hotels, though I was annoyed by the $50/day parking fee. This seems to be the Canadian Vegas. Expect a carnival atmosphere and fees on everything. Use a credit card.",
          "Good atmosphere! Nice view of the falls.. You can walk .. Go on journey behind the falls.. Perfect visit during all climate ..",
          "Great place to eat",
          "Come be amazed at the beauty of God's handiwork. The park is absolutely beautiful; from the Falls, the wildlife, and the amazing views and attractions. Price wise for families, your best bet is to purchase a Discovery Pass and by all means, \u2026",
          "the most beautiful place in the world",
          "A must see wonder of the world. Best seen from the Canadian side.",

          "It was an amazing and an extraordinary experience.\ud83d\ude0d I really loved it. \ud83e\udd14 I recommend you to go in days when it is not to cold. Believe me you are going to get wet.\ud83d\ude1c",
          "An amazing experience or adventure. Views are spectacular. Places are amazing, and that is all before you even see the Falls, which are like one of 7 wonders of the world.",
          "A beautiful spectacle of nature. I've been twice and I still marvel at it. Definitely something to see at least once in your life.",
          "Niagara falls is obviously beautiful but its only worth going there in a nice weather otherwise u will feel freezing there. I recommend the boat ride in summer. $30 is price and its worth it. It looks like heaven on earth when you see it \u2026",
          "I'm always full of emotions when I see the falls. It's really breathtaking whatever the weather is. Sure it's better when it's sunny. But it does not change anything. It's really important to take care of them because everyone should be able to see what the nature can do.",
          "Beautiful. A must visit on your bucket list.",
          "Absolutely amazing, just to see & hear the immense water falls was out of this world. A great experience & stunning views of the falls & of the American falls.

          "a great place to visit at least once if nor more",
          "Such a magic place, love being next to this majestic water falls, mi wife and daughter were speechless, it is very breathtaking when looking at them, if you get the opportunity come visit it.",

          "Wonderful place! Beautiful lighting and sunset point",
          "Beautiful location the beat of the water is like good music to the ear",
          "More beautiful and soothing than my visit to The Grand Canyon. If you can only choose one to see, you should choose here, Niagara Falls. Especially from the Canada side \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6. Breathtaking. Mesmerizing. Soothing.",
          "What a beautiful place, the real power of nuture. The best view point in my opinion is at the end of the walkway you can see the power and the speed of the water right before they going down. I would skip the boat ride... It's cool but not what I expected.",
          "The Canadian side is do much better than the US side. A must visit!",
          "Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the US state of New York and the Canadian province of Ontario. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles the international border between Canada and the United States.",
          "This waterfall is so amazing! Especially when you wait till night time there is a beautiful light show! We went to the waterall around 4pm to see it during the day and by 5pm it gets darker and the light show last all night long. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "Beautiful place to visit!",
          "Great experience at night",
          "Amazing. Stay overnight as the falls are illuminated every night and check website for twice-a-month fireworks. Pay extra for fall facing room because it is totally worth it. Stayed at the Hilton, Falls view and the views are excellent.",

          "Make sure you bring a jacket and an umbrella and get ready to walk! Thats the best way to take in the sites. Lots of interesting things to do out here get out there talk to the locals and learn the scene.",
          "Photo says it all!!! As expected, lots of tourists.. . Good things was that there were lots of parking lots spreading around the area too. Most of those medium size parking lots charge $5/day and they were just as close to the falls within 7 minutes walk.. .",
          "This was a great trip like Manhattan (NYC) but with many waterfalls not just the 2 always seen. Its a must see at least just once.  Personally I'm going back because it was fun.",

          "I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to say about Niagara Falls that countless guidebooks haven't said.  It's a wonder of the world.  When you are standing at the top, near to the edge, you get a sense of what the end of the world might feel \u2026",
          "Incredible experience! At the American side you can have an experience of the state park, like going through the central part (in nyc) just next to the Niagara falls. You can have some attractions like the islands, the winds caves are \u2026",

You MUST do both.",

        "wiki": "The Bethlehem Steel Corporation was an American steel and shipbuilding company that for much of the 20th century was one of the world's largest steel producing and shipbuilding companies. The company's roots trace to 1857 with the establishment of the Bethlehem Iron Company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Bethlehem Steel was formed in 1904 through the merger of the earlier companies, and existed through the decline of American steel manufacturing during the 1970s until its bankruptcy in 2001 and final dissolution in 2003.\nThe Bethlehem Steel Company became the primary subsidiary company of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1904. The Bethlehem Steel Company is the first Bethlehem Steel while the Bethlehem Steel Corporation is the second Bethlehem Steel; both companies existed simultaneously after 1904, but the Bethlehem Steel Company was eventually merged into the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in the 1960s. After a decline in the American steel industry and other problems leading to the company's bankruptcy in 2001, the Corporation was dissolved and its remaining assets were sold to International Steel Group in 2003.\nThe Bethlehem Steel Corporation (using the Bethlehem Steel Company) and the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, which was also a Bethlehem Steel Corporation subsidiary, were two of the most powerful symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership. Their demise is often cited as one of the most prominent examples of the U.S. economy's shift away from industrial manufacturing, its failure to compete with global competition, and management's penchant for short-term profits.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roots: the Bethlehem Iron Company ===\n\n\n==== Establishment ====\nThe Saucona Iron Company was established by Augustus Wolle. The Panic of 1857, a national financial crisis, halted further organization of the company and construction of the works. Eventually, the organization was completed, the site moved elsewhere in South Bethlehem, and the company's name was changed to the Bethlehem Rolling Mill and Iron Company. On June 14, 1860, the board of directors of the fledgling company elected Alfred Hunt president.On May 1, 1861, the company's title was changed again, this time to the Bethlehem Iron Company. Construction of the first blast furnace began on July 1, 1861, and it went into operation on January 4, 1863. The first rolling mill was built between the spring of 1861 and the summer of 1863, with the first railroad rails being rolled on September 26. A machine shop, in 1865, and another blast furnace, in 1867, were completed. During its early years, the company produced rails for the rapidly expanding railroads and armor plating for the US Navy.\n\n\n==== Growth ====\n\nAlthough the company continued to prosper during the early 1880s, its share of the rail market began to decline in the face of competition from growing Pittsburgh and Scranton-based firms such as the Carnegie Steel Company and Lackawanna Steel. The nation's decision to rebuild the United States Navy with steam-driven, steel-hulled warships reshaped Bethlehem Iron Company's destiny.\nFollowing the American Civil War, the Navy quickly downsized after the end of hostilities, as national energies were redirected toward settling the West and rebuilding the war-ravaged South. Almost no new ordnance was produced, and new technology was neglected. By 1881, international incidents highlighted the poor condition of the U.S. fleet and the need to rebuild it to protect U.S. trade and prestige.\nIn 1883, Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler and Secretary of the Army Robert Todd Lincoln appointed Lt. William Jaques to the Gun Foundry Board. Jaques was sent on several fact-finding tours of European armament makers and on one of these trips he formed business ties with the firm of Joseph Whitworth of Manchester, England. He returned to America as Whitworth's agent and, in 1885, was granted an extended furlough to pursue this personal interest.\nJaques was aware that the U.S. Navy would soon solicit bids for the production of heavy guns and other products such as armor that would be needed to further expand the fleet. Jaques contacted the Bethlehem Iron Company with a proposal to serve as an intermediary between it and the Whitworth Company, so that Bethlehem could erect a heavy-forging plant to produce ordnance. In 1885, John Fritz, accompanied by Bethlehem Iron Company directors Robert H. Sayre, E.P. Wilbur, William Thurston, and Joseph Wharton, met with Jaques in Philadelphia. In early 1886, a contract between Bethlehem Iron and the Whitworth Company had been executed.\nIn spring 1886, Congress passed a naval appropriations bill that authorized the construction of two armored second-class battleships, one protected cruiser, and one first-class torpedo boat, and the complete rebuilding and modernization of two Civil War-era monitors. The two second-class battleships (the USS Texas and the USS Maine) would have both large-caliber guns (12-inch and 10-inch respectively) and heavy armor plating. Bethlehem secured both the forging and armor contracts on June 28, 1887.\nBetween 1888 and 1892, the Bethlehem Iron Company completed the first U.S. heavy-forging plant. It was designed by John Fritz with the assistance of Russell Wheeler Davenport, who had entered Bethlehem's employ in 1888. By autumn 1890, Bethlehem Iron was delivering gun forging to the U.S. Navy and was completing facilities to provide armor plating.\n\nDuring the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, a structure that was designed to make the world marvel received its giant axle from Bethlehem Iron. The world's first Ferris wheel needed enough steel to assemble a 140-foot tower to support an all-steel wheel, altogether making a 264-foot (80 m) structure. The iron made in Bethlehem Steel's blast furnaces was responsible for the world's largest single piece of cast iron that had ever been made up to that time.In 1898, Frederick Taylor joined Bethlehem Steel as a management consultant in order to solve an expensive machine shop capacity problem. Taylor and Maunsel White, with a team of assistants, applied a series of management principles established by Taylor and that later would be known as scientific management to increase mass production.\nThe Bethlehem Iron Company was very successful and profitable. The corporate ownership of the Bethlehem Iron Company believed that it could be even more profitable. To accomplish that goal, the corporate ownership of the Bethlehem Iron Company switched to steel production; the steel production became known as a new company called Bethlehem Steel Company.\n\n\n=== Bethlehem Steel Company ===\n\n\n==== Establishment and involvement with the Bethlehem Iron Company ====\nIn 1899, the Bethlehem Steel Company was established. This was the first company to carry the name Bethlehem Steel. The Bethlehem Steel Company (also known as Bethlehem Steel Works) was incorporated to take over all liabilities of the Bethlehem Iron Company. The Bethlehem Iron Company and the Bethlehem Steel Company were separate companies under the same ownership. The Bethlehem Steel Company leased the properties that were owned by the Bethlehem Iron Company.\nIn 1901, Charles M. Schwab, who is unrelated to the stockbroker, Charles R. Schwab (using a syndicate from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.) purchased the Bethlehem Steel Company and made Samuel Broadbent Vice President. During this time, the company's lease with the Bethlehem Iron Company came to an end (canceled) as the Bethlehem Steel Company gained control of all properties from the Bethlehem Iron Company; the Bethlehem Iron Company ceased operations.\n\n\n==== Operating as a subsidiary of the United States Shipbuilding Company ====\nSchwab transferred his ownership of the Bethlehem Steel Company to the United States Steel Corporation (U.S. Steel), the company he was president of. This  period was brief; Schwab repurchased Bethlehem Steel Company, then sold it to the United States Shipbuilding Company. The United States Shipbuilding Company owned Bethlehem Steel Company only a brief time. The United States Shipbuilding Company was in turmoil; its subsidiaries, including the Bethlehem Steel Company, contributed to the United States Shipbuilding Company's problems. Schwab again became involved with Bethlehem Steel Company, through the parent company, the United States Shipbuilding Company.The United States Shipbuilding Company planned in 1903 to reorganize as the Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company, this would be the second company to use the name Bethlehem Steel. The United States Shipbuilding Company was not reorganized as the Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company. Instead. a plan was drawn up for a new company to be formed to replace the United States Shipbuilding Company. The new company would take the \"Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company\" name. The plan would be  carri out in 1904, but the new company did not take the \"Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company\" name. Instead, the new company took the name Bethlehem Steel Corporation.\n\n\n=== Bethlehem Steel Corporation ===\n\n\n==== Establishment and early growth ====\n\nIn 1904, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation was formed, this is the new company replacing the United States Shipbuilding Company; the new company did not use the name \"Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company\". The Bethlehem Steel Corporation was formed by Schwab, who had recently resigned from U.S. Steel and by Joseph Wharton who founded the Wharton School in Philadelphia. Schwab became the first president and first chairman of its board of directors of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation..\nAfter its formation, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation purchased the Bethlehem Steel Company and the remaining subsidiaries from the United States Shipbuilding Company; the Bethlehem Steel Corporation did not purchase the United States Shipbuilding Company. The Bethlehem Steel Company became a subsidiary of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, though the Bethlehem Steel Company also had subsidiaries of their own. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation becomes the second company to use the name Bethlehem Steel. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation became the second largest steel provider in the United States with the help of the subsidiary Bethlehem Steel Company which was the first Bethlehem Steel. Both the Bethlehem Steel Company and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation existed simultaneously after 1904.  The Bethlehem Steel Company was eventually merged into the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in the 1960s.\nThe Bethlehem Steel Corporation installed the gray rolling mill and produced the first wide-flange structural shapes to be made in America. These shapes were partly responsible for ushering in the age of the skyscraper and establishing Bethlehem Steel as the leading supplier of steel to the construction industry.In the early 1900s Samuel Broadbent lead an initiative to diversify the company. The corporation branched out from steel, with iron mines in Cuba and shipyards around the country. In 1913  Samuel Broadbent, it acquired the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, thereby assuming the role of one of the world's major shipbuilders. In 1917, it incorporated its shipbuilding division as Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Limited. In 1922, it purchased the Lackawanna Steel Company, which included the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad as well as extensive coal holdings.\n\n\n==== 1930s and 1940s ====\n\nDuring World War I and World War II, Bethlehem Steel was a major supplier of armor plate and ordnance to the U.S. armed forces, including armor plate and large-caliber guns for the Navy.\nIn the 1930s, the company made the steel sections and parts for the Golden Gate Bridge and built for Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), a new oil refinery in La Plata City, Argentina, which was the tenth-largest in the world. During World War II, as much as 70 percent of airplane cylinder forgings, one-quarter of the armor plate for warships, and one-third of the big cannon forgings for the U.S armed forces were turned out by Bethlehem Steel.Bethlehem Steel ranked seventh among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's 15 shipyards produced a total of 1,121 ships, more than any other builder during the war and nearly one-fifth of the U.S. Navy's two-ocean fleet. It employed as many as 180,000 persons, the bulk of the company's total employment of 300,000.\nEugene Grace was president of Bethlehem Steel from 1916 to 1945, and chairman of the board from 1945 until his retirement in 1957. Eugene Grace orchestrated Bethlehem Steel's wartime efforts. In 1943, he promised President Roosevelt one ship per day, and exceeded the commitment by 15 ships.The war effort drained Bethlehem of much of its male workforce. The company hired female employees to guard and work on the factory floor or in the company offices. After the war, the female workers were promptly fired in favor of their male counterparts.On Liberty Fleet Day, September 27, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was present at the launching of the first Liberty ship SS Patrick Henry at Bethlehem's  Fairfield (Baltimore, Maryland) yard.  Also launched that same day were the Liberty SS James McKay at Sparrows Point, Maryland, and the Emergency vessel SS Sinclair Superflame  at Fore River in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\n\n==== 1950s and 1960s ====\n\nWhen peacetime came, the plant continued to supply a wide variety of structural shapes for the construction trades. Galvanized sheet steel under the name BETHCON was widely produced for use as duct work or spiral conduit.Additionally, the company produced forged products for defense, power generation, and steel-producing companies.From 1949 to 1952, Bethlehem Steel had a contract with the federal government of the United States to roll uranium fuel rods for nuclear reactors in Bethlehem Steel's Lackawanna, New York, plant. Workers were not aware of the dangers of the hazardous substance and were not given protective equipment. Some workers have since attempted to receive compensation under a year 2000 radiation-exposure law. The law required the Labor Department to compensate workers up to $150,000 if they developed cancer later in life, if their work history involved enough radiation exposure to significantly increase their cancer risk. The Bethlehem Steel workers have not been awarded this compensation because the radiation dose involved in processing fresh uranium fuel is low, and produces a small risk relative to the baseline risk. The larger danger in processing uranium is chemical poisoning from the heavy metal, which does not produce cancer.)The steel industry in the U.S. prospered during and after World War II, while the steel industries in Germany and Japan lay devastated by Allied bombardment. Bethlehem Steel's high point came in the 1950s, as the company began manufacturing 23 million tons per year. In 1958, the company's president, Arthur B. Homer, was the highest-paid U.S. business executive. The firm built its largest plant, at Burns Harbor, Indiana, between 1962 and 1964.\nThe late 1960s offered a harbinger of the troubled times to come. In 1967, the company lost its bid to provide the steel for the original World Trade Center. The contracts, a single one of which was for 50,000 tons of steel, went to competitors in Seattle, St. Louis, New York and Illinois.\n\n\n==== 1970s through 1990s ====\n\nThe U.S. advantage lasted about two decades, during which the U.S. steel industry operated with little foreign competition. But eventually, the foreign firms were rebuilt with modern techniques such as continuous casting, while profitable U.S. companies resisted modernization. Bethlehem experimented with continuous casting but never fully adopted the practice.\nMeanwhile, the average age of the Bethlehem workforce was increasing, and the ratio of retirees to workers was rising, meaning that the value created by each worker had to cover a greater portion of pension costs than before. Former top manager Eugene Grace had failed to adequately invest in the company's pension plans during the 1950s. When the company was at its peak, the pension payments that should have been made were not. As a result, the company encountered difficulty when it faced rising pension costs and diminishing profits.By the 1970s, imported foreign steel was generally cheaper than domestically produced steel. The company faced growing competition from mini-mills, smaller-scale operations that could sell steel at lower prices.\nIn 1982, Bethlehem reported a loss of US$1.5 billion and shut down many of its operations. Profitability returned briefly in 1988, but restructuring and shutdowns continued through the 1990s.In the mid-1980s, demand for the plant's structural products began to diminish, and new competition entered the marketplace. Lighter construction styles, in part due to lower-height construction styles (i.e., low-rise buildings), did not require the heavy structural grades produced at the Bethlehem plant.\nIn 1991, Bethlehem Steel Corporation discontinued coal mining (under the name BethEnergy). Bethlehem Steel exited the railroad car business in 1993.\nAt the end of 1995, it closed steel-making at the main Bethlehem plant. After roughly 140 years of metal production at its Bethlehem, Pennsylvania plant, Bethlehem Steel Corporation ceased its Bethlehem operations.\nThe Bethlehem Steel Corporation ceased shipbuilding activities in 1997 in an attempt to preserve its steel-making operations. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation would file for bankruptcy in 2001 and dissolve in 2003.\n\n\n==== Closing and bankruptcy ====\n\nDespite the closing of its local operations, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation tried to reduce the impact on the Lehigh Valley area with plans to revitalize the south side of Bethlehem. It hired consultants to develop conceptual plans on the reuse of the massive property. The consensus was to rename the 163 acres (66 ha) site Bethlehem Works and to use the land for cultural, recreational, educational, entertainment, and retail development. The National Museum of Industrial History, in association with the Smithsonian Institution and the Bethlehem Commerce Center, consisting of 1,600 acres (650 ha) of prime industrial property, would be erected on the site along with a casino and a large retail and entertainment complex.\nInexpensive steel imports and the failure of management to innovate, embrace technology, and improve labor conditions contributed to Bethlehem Steel's demise.\nIn 1998, after denied pension benefits, a lawsuit was filed in the 3rd Court of Appeals in Philadelphia: \u201cLawrence Hollyfield, Fiduciary to the Estate of Collins Hollyfield v. PENSION PLAN OF BETHLEHEM STEEL CORPORATION and Subsidiary Companies;\u201d It was settled in favor of Hollyfield in 2001. It led to a class action lawsuit filed by the workers union soon thereafter. This settlement also led to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PGBC) assuming all pension payouts from Bethlehem Steel, the largest such assumption in U.S. History.In 2001, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation filed for bankruptcy. In 2003, the company was dissolved and its remaining assets, including the six plants, were acquired by the International Steel Group. International Steel Group was in turn acquired by Mittal Steel in 2005, which then merged with Arcelor to become ArcelorMittal in 2006.\nIn 2007, the Bethlehem property was sold to Sands BethWorks, and plans to build a casino where the plant once stood were drafted. Construction began in fall 2007; the casino was completed in 2009. Ironically, the casino had difficulty finding structural steel for construction due to a global steel shortage and pressure to build Pennsylvania's tax-generating casinos. 16,000 tons of steel were needed to build the $600 million complex.The site of the company's original plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is home to SteelStacks, an arts and entertainment district. The plant's five blast furnaces were left standing and serve as a backdrop for the new campus. SteelStacks currently features the ArtsQuest Center, a contemporary performing arts center, the Wind Creek Bethlehem casino resort, a gambling emporium, and new studios for PBS member station WLVT-TV (channel 39). The area also includes three outdoor music venues \u2013 Levitt Pavilion, a free music venue featuring lawn seating for up to 2,500 people, Air Products Town Square at Steelstacks, and PNC Plaza, which hosts concerts featuring well-known artists. Levitt Pavilion and the Sands Casino Resort are connected via the Hoover-Mason Trestle linear park.\nIn 2012, Bethlehem Steel, a three-piece indie rock band, named itself after the company to honor it.On November 9, 2016, a warehouse being used as a recycling facility that was part of the Lackawanna, New York, Bethlehem Steel Complex caught fire and burned down.The corporate records of Bethlehem Steel are housed at the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, DE and at the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem, PA.\n\nOn May 19, 2019, the former Bethlehem Steel headquarters building in the west side of Bethlehem was imploded.\n\n\n== Shipyards ==\n\nFore River Shipyard \u2013 Massachusetts\nBethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard in Sparrows Point, Maryland (now Barletta Industries Sparrows Point Shipyard and Industrial Complex)\nAlameda Shipyard \u2013 California\nPier 70 in San Francisco \u2013 California (formerly \"U.S. Iron Works\", now BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair)\nMariner Harbor, Staten Island, New York \u2013 active for the World War II years and beyond\n*Bethlehem Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc., Beaumont, Texas  (1948\u20131989) The Beaumont Yard was one of the major sources of offshore drilling rigs built in the United States with seventy\u2013two (72) offshore rigs built at the yard.  Seventy-one Type C1 ships were built during World War II by Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc.  The shipyard dated back to 1917 owned by the Beaumont Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (1917\u20131922).  Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Company owned and operated the yard from 1922 to 1948.  After Bethlehem Steel ownership (1948\u20131989), the yard was owned by Trinity Industries from 1989 to 1994.\n\n\n== Freight cars ==\nFrom 1923 to 1991, Bethlehem Steel was one of the world's leading producers of railroad freight cars through their purchase of the former Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company, whose railcar division was at Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Despite its status as a major integrated steel maker, Bethlehem Steel Freight Car Division pioneered the use of aluminum in freight car construction. The Johnstown plant was purchased from Bethlehem Steel through a management buyout in 1991, creating Johnstown America Industries.\n\n\n== Influence on American landmarks ==\nThe company manufactured the steel for many of the country's most prominent landmarks:\n\nBridges:\nGeorge Washington Bridge\nGolden Gate Bridge\nPeace Bridge\nVerrazano-Narrows Bridge; Staten Island tower.\nBuildings:\nAlcatraz Island\nEmpire State Building (Bethlehem supplied some very large structurals only.

          "Had the aquarium not been included in our multi-attraction pass and we had paid for it separately I would have given a worse rating but since it was basically included for free it was worth a stop. Very small not much to see, didn't even stay for a show.",
          "This was part of our Discovery Pass (adult $45 child $35) and was not on our original to do list. We added it once we realized the Discovery Passes saved us money and added activities and unlimited trolley rides. The aquarium is small. We might feel that way because we have a",
          "We were surprised it was so tiny. We heard from relatives they had one housed dolphin were the seals are now. Very shocked. They jelly fish were mesmerizing as jellyfish so often are. It was so nice that their displays worked too. Taking pride in their building is so",
          "If this would not have been part of my package that I bought I would have been mad that we paid for it. It was really small. My daughters enjoyed the sea lions though so I was glad we mad the long walk there. There area it was in was a little scary and I was glad that I",
          "We enjoyed walking through and viewing all the animals. I enjoyed the seal show but the best part of Aquarium Niagara were the Jelly Fish display.",
          "We wanted to go to the aquarium, but the road was closed. We tried driving around to figure out another way to get to it, but ended up giving up. I would recommend avoiding it until at least August until the road is reopened.",
          "It is smaller than I expected . The animals are cute and the show was cute with the sea lions they are happy and look well taken care of",
          "Sea lions, seals and penguins are the cutest draw. Many tanks with other water life. Small but a nice trip if the weather is too hot or rainy. Included in the Discover Pass but you have to pay to park there $8? You may be able to park at the Discovery Center across the",
          "Since we got the Discovery Pass (for Maid Of The Mist and Cave Of The Winds) we decided to check out the Aquarium. After exiting the trolley, take the raised walking path over the highway to get there (signs are a bit misleading). Be sure to check out the outdoor exhibit if it",
          "A very small aquarium but appears to be well managed and nicely run. Displays were attractive and informative. We only spent about about one to 1-1/2 hours there, including a brief presentation on the rescue seals.",
          "Decent place to visit where you have decent collection of sea animals. Penguin feed, sea lion shows were pretty good and worth visiting. Penguins were fed as you were feeding your own children. Sea lions stole the show with their performance and they are worth waiting to watch.",
          "Being Australian, one thing we do very very well is our animal parks, aquariums and wildlife centres. So we wouldn\u2019t have even walked in except it was part of our Niagara Falls pass. We had a quick look around, but in and out in 1/2 an hour. Sorry but without small children it",
          "My family of two adults and three children (ages 8,7,5) enjoyed this little aquarium. It is small and only takes about an hour to view everything but you really get a very good view of each exhibit and there are a few small interactive activities. They also offer some",
          "Very Dated and Small it is the same today as it was twenty something years ago. There is so much potential for this place to become more of a destination but whoever is running this place is not spending a dime. Sad. It\u2019s worth seeing once do not plan your day around it. You can",
          "This is a cute but very small aquarium. Our discovery pass gave us access to this aquarium. We wouldn't have come if it wasn't included. They have some shows but only once a day so if you really want to go you need to look up the times. They have some cool looking fish,",
          "I struggle to give this three stars. First, five dollars to park. Ok but it takes an hour to visit the entire aquarium. Maybe an extra 1/2 for the gift shop. The outdoor sea lion exhibit is way to small. Felt bad for the little guys. Penguins were a bright spot. The seal show",
          "The aquarium is small but worth a visit of 1 or 2 hours. The presentations on the Penguins and Sea Lions were interesting and informative. We did not see all of the seal show but what we saw was good. The staff are very knowledgeable and there are a variety of fishes etc to see",
          "Although I've lived in Niagara Falls for my entire life, and have frequently visited the Aquarium of Niagara as a child, I just purchased my first one-year membership, as the reduced cost for disabled members is $45.00 - the money was very well spent, as I've already visited",
          "Another stop on the discovery pass. It's a small aquarium, but the kids liked it. Just enough wild life to keep it interesting. If you are dropped off at the discovery center it is a hike up and over the pedestrian bridge to the aquarium.",
          "Really enjoyed this small pleasant diversion. Two floors of well done tanks and pleasant friendly people who obviously enjoy their jobs. Local info on fish habitat was good to see. Sealion show tops it in center ring and jellyfish display was awesome. Elevator for wheelchair",
          "The aquarium was nice kinda small but nice. The seal show was great! Definitely fun for the little kids highly recommend this for children.",
          "We really enjoyed the seal show at the aquarium. Their rehabilitation area was fascinating as well. There is a pleasant area to sit and relax just outside the building. The exhibits inside are informative and quite interesting.",
          "Went there on the pass. Was very nice to see the show and the outside area. Very small not like other we have been to. But worth the time",
          "I grew up in the Ohio Valley in the 50's and early 60's so a trip to Niagara Falls was exciting. I think this was the very 1st aquarium I ever saw. It was fantastic at the time, but it really hasn't changed much since the 60's. We went again in the mid 70's and saw the",
          "not a large place but still very nice. penguins are cute as can be and the seals are great to watch, be sure to see seals on right side of building we almost missed the outdoor pool for seals",
          "We purchased discovery pass which included this attraction In Niagara state park. Aquarium is small so you can finish it in approx 1 hour. Sea lion show is highly recommended, just make sure to reach early and take seats. One more show which I liked was sea lion rescue show in",

          "I\u2019m baffled that this establishment got 2 stars let alone 5 in some reviews!! What an overwhelming feeling of sadness you get as soon as you walk up. These sea lions have depression written all over them, barely moving around acting like puppets all day. Puppets which they are -",
          "Unfortunately, this aquarium is not good. It is part of the discovery pass - had I paid for it as a separate experience, I would have been very upset. It is so small and the sea lion exhibit outside for the rescue animals is pathetically small.",
          "Took a road trip to Niagara Falls and stopped at the Aquarium. First, a tacky entry fee to park, $5.00 . This is not a good start to nickle and dime your customer. Entry fee was reasonable. I don't mind paying for the sake of the aqua life. It was small, some sharks, sea lions,",
          "We came to see each of the exhibits. Kids especially liked the seals outside, penguins inside. Looked at each exhibit. There are a number of exhibits for the two floor building. Kids liked it, didn\u2019t take much time. This aquarium is part of the discovery pass as are the falls,",
          "Always a hit and a place I\u2019ve enjoyed since I was a kid. Much to see and much to do. Easy to get to with free parking. You can learn a lot or just sit back and enjoy.",
          "I love stopping at zoos and aquariums on trips do I had to stop here! I am so pleased I did! This was a beautiful aquarium! They had a seal show which was phenomenal! Staff was amazing with the animals!",
          "Like other reviewers, we went here because we bought the Niagara Falls Discovery Pass. It is a small aquarium, circular in shape, one floor street level and one floor above that had good views of the sea lion show. We arrived as they were feeding the penguins at, I believe,",
          "Having been to many other aquariums we wouldn\u2019t have made the stop but it was included in our discovery pass. We seen some things in the alien underwater exhibit we never have - different types of jellyfish and such but for the most part not much to excite in this small place.",
          "If this wasn\u2019t included in the Discovery pass, we never would have done it. It is an extremely small aquarium and not something I\u2019d go back & do again. They certainly make the best with what they have, but it\u2019s not that great of an aquarium. The penguin & seal exhibits are the",
          "The best word to describe this place is \"humble.\" It holds no candle to the Shedd or to Newport Aquarium, but I will say that I saw a specimen of jellyfish here at Niagara's little aquarium that I haven't seen anywhere else! Can't recall its name but it looked like little",
          "I would skip this, unless you have time to kill. Unless you do not have access to a good aquarium you will be disappointed.",
          "Not worth it did not even take a pic. Waist of time. Not much to say here even though it\u2019s included in pass don\u2019t bother going.",
          "Just had a great experience with the Seals of the Aquarium of Niagara! they're cute and smart and give great kisses (even though it's a bit fishy!) I had a great time! if you want to do this, don't wear your Sunday best... The floor is wet, the seal is wet and you'll have at",
          "My teens were not impressed but I can see that little school-ages kids would really enjoy their shows and happenings at this small aquarium.",
          "Great place for a couple of hours with young children. Nice new jellyfish display. And you\u2019re finished before the kids act up",
          "It was a cute aquarium but it was very small. They charged probably more than expected for the size and time it took to go thru. The exhibits they did have were nice.",
          "The zeal show at the Niagara Falls aquarium is a two zeal performance show although I felt it was a bit too short. It was informative With well trained zeal\u2019s Good show.",
          "Great attraction for a family outing. Free parking is adjacent to the building. The aquarium is not to large to be overwhelming for younger children and is packed with wonderful exhibits. Don't miss the Seal and Sea Lion show which highlights just how much love and attention",
          "New- clean-NO terrible smells. Great to watch penguin feeding and the seal show/ Great fish displays -well worth the admission",
          "Wasn\u2019t sure about this place as we\u2019re used to the larger ones in Boston & Baltimore but this was pretty good despite the size. The seal show as an unexpected delight, as was the octopus. We walked from Clinton Hill on the Canadian side across the bridge moving quickly through",
          "The Seals! They are the main attraction, I could sit and watch them for a while. They are fun to watch!",
          "I visited the aquarium today with my 11 year old daughter, sister, and mom while we are visiting Niagara on a mini vacation. While the aquarium is small, it is well worth the price and your time. They have a schedule posted when they feed the penguins and have sea lion shows.",
          "We spent an hour here because the rain made hiking around the falls too cold. The sea lion show was decent. I also liked the jellyfish display. The rest, not so much. After the show, we were gone in 15 minutes.",
          "My kids love aquariums and we have a large one close by us that we have a membership to. We were told it was a short walk from the Falls but it certainly is not and you have to go over a steep bridge. We were exhausted by the time we got there but that wasn\u2019t a problem because",
          "I hadn't been here in ages, so on a somewhat overcast Friday, I decided to visit. It was great! Not too big, not too small. Really nice and walkable, not overwhelming. I loved the sea lions and seals - the show was very short, but great - which is good since there is no",
          "The kids had a good time, which is all that matters, but it seemed a bit expensive for the size and amount of exhibits. Luckily we had our zoo membership card with us, so it was about half price using that. So be sure to check if they are an affiliate with your zoo or museum",
          "Small little aquarium! We really enjoyed loved the live shows and the atmosphere! The staff was phenomenal! I would definitely come back again! Prices aren't bad either and offer military discount!",
          "The aquarium is a good place to visit with young kids on a rainy/snowy day. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, this place is small, but we chose to ignore that and went anyway. The first floor has the seals, penguins, turtles, and many fish displays. There is also a fun",
          "We did get tickets from our hotel with alittle price reduction. I am glad we did because the place was very small for I guess what I was expecting. If we hadn't stayed for the different shows it would have only taken 20 minutes. We came in March 2019 and in the winter parking",
          "The kids loved it. The place is inexpensive and well run. Very clean. Hoping they expand the exhibits to include even more. Will stop in again when we are in the area.",
          "This aquarium is VERY small. Walked the whole thing in 20 minutes. I know its probably more for kids so let's do the math. If my wife and I brought our two young children we would spend 50 dollars for a few small aquariums with fish and some rescued penguins and sea lions. I",
          "Greatly enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium of Niagara. We are from Corpus Christi, Texas and have only been to the Texas State Aquarium which is quite large and we love. In comparison the Niagara aquarium is very small but I can say we really loved our experience there. The",
          "Very small but charming. We did it as part of package deal so was worth going, but if you pay just for admission to the aquarium it seemed a bit overpriced to me.",
          "We have not been here since all the new renovations and were amazed at the upgrades to the exhibits. Our favorite by far is the new penguin exhibit - it's twice the size of the old one and you can view the penguins swimming now. We were told there will soon be a breeding",
          "We visited with our 6 year old daughter. For a small town like Niagara Falls, this is a nice place to spend a few hours. The facility is small but what do you expect for a small city like NF. The staff was very kind to my daughter and worked hard to make it interesting for both",
          "This place needs to get a complete overhaul. Where is the wealthy benefactor to pull this place out of the pits? I was shocked at- how small, barely any animals, penguins never even got into the water, just laid there looking sick or bored, Very dirty tanks, every display",
          "Perfect for my 2 year old - the sea lion show and the penguin feeding were cute and he loved it. Not too much else to see, but it was clean and the staff was very friendly.",
          "This place was awesome they actually take wounded & abandoned sea animals. They had a pool out front with some deals in it one had an eye missing another had a missing fin they told how they were hurt&why they will never be able to go back to the ocean.",
          "This is a great find. It\u2019s a short walk along the rim from the falls. $14 entrance fee. Several exhibits, including penguins, sea lions and seals. Plenty of events for guests to see; we watched the penguin feeding and sea lion show. The staff were on hand to answer any questions",
          "great place for families, no or little wait time like the rest of the niagara experiences. Very family friendly and easy place for a more relaxed atmosphere. Show with the sea lions was really cute.",
          "We visited with kids aged 8 and 10 so it cost almost $56 and we literally finished the walking in 40 minutes reading much of the displays. Did not get to stay for any shows, but the sea lions and penguins looked well cared for and the staff was nice.",
          "We traveled to buffalo to visit family for the weekend and were very excited to bring our 16 month old to the aquarium. The sea lions and seals were awesome! There are several other very small exhibits, and it\u2019s 2 floors. I was very surprised when we went around the entire",
          "Aquarium from the Niagara State Park was quite a journey even taking the trolley. After the trolley let's you off, the walk is a bit much for elderly or limited mobility people. The day we were there, the penguin exhibit was closed for maintenance which was the sole reason I",
          "We loved this aquarium! So much to see and the show with the seals was GREAT! We saw fish and other things that we have never seen before.",
          "After reading the reviews for this aquarium, I didn\u2019t have very high expectations for my visit. I bought the discovery pass at the state park, so I figured it was worth the visit with my children (5 and 8). I was very pleasantly surprised! They have seals, sea lions, and penguin",
          "This is a small aquarium that is part of the NY Niagara Pass. It was the \"last\" stop on the trolley tour. We walked across the road bridge. We loved the seals! We spent about an hour or so here and saw all the exhibits, it wasn't too crowded.",
          "Enjoyed see several of the shows and feeding times. We saw the penguins, sea lions. The handlers explained everything so well. Great set up!",
          "Very informative and interesting. The sea lions were awesome. I could have watched them all day. There was a giant one in the outdoor Area who literally stood on his back flippers and walked the pool. So cute. Not a fan of \u201ccaptive\u201d wild animals but appreciate places that help",
          "although my 2 year old daughter had a blast just running from one end of the place to the other, it was kind of boring. very small. the seal show was cool, but otherwise we were in and out in less than hour.",
          "this aquarium is on the small side and it does not take a lot of time to go through it . but there seal show is one to see",
          "Very small. Not horrible not great. Very small that's the best I can say about it. Will take you maybe 30-45 minutes at the most. I'm not a big negative review person but there's not much going on. I would say the people working are very nice. It is something to do just don't",
          "We went here as part of a pass that we bought. A very tiny aquarium. it was just ok. It was in the area so we went in, and if you like aquariums, it's nice. Everything in the gift shop is ridiculously priced",
          "As a huge lover of Penguins, I was looking forward to their new $3.5 million Penguin Exhibit. What a disappointment, it was boring and bland. The Penguins were molting, which is in no way the aquariums fault, but better signage would have helped explain that to people. As I",
          "Don't go here it not worth the money there nothing to see there this is the worse part of my trip 14 dollar for nothing ot was sad",
          "This is a nice place to visit while in Niagara Falls. It is small for an aquarium, yes, but it's bigger than some I've gone to in the past. The entire building is rounded, with a round pool at its heart, where there are seal and sea lion programs given multiple times a day.",
          "This aquarium is offered in a package of several attractions. We didn\u2019t want to do all the attractions but we were intrigued because of the new Penguin exhibit. For parents, you might want to take this into consideration....the Exhibit is about 5-6 very old Penguins, one being",
          "not sure we would have done this on its own, but since it was part of the discovery pass, we were glad we did. a bit small but had a nice sea lion show.",
          "This aquarium was quite small- it certainly shouldn\u2019t be a major destination on its own, but was a Fun, quick stop as part of the discovery pass with other falls attractions on the new York side...mainly one floor with tanks, pretty good size, enclosed penguin & sea lion tanks,",
          "The aquarium was small, but still educational. If you want to watch the shows, make sure you get a good seat prior to the show starting or you might miss some things because your view is obstructed with people. My kids and I still enjoyed our time there.",
          "I was expecting so much more. There is not much to see here, it is very small. The best thing was a lonely single seal swimming in the pool. Some of the fish were cool. I guess very young children might be impressed. Save your money and time.",
          "This place was amazing!!! Not to big, but alot to see. Loved the feeding and show times. This was a great place to spend a few hours. Great price also. Would recommend that you stop in and see this gem.",
          "Who knew that seals are susceptible to cataracts? The outdoor pool is where the seals who've had the operation can recover in quiet. This alone, was worth coming to the aquarium. Good explanatory exhibits outside helped instruct us about the operation.",
          "This place is so drab compared to other aquariums we have been to. There are basically handful of species. The place stinks. Its very unkempt. Its also in a very unsafe, rundown area of town. Save the money. Dont go.",
          "We love going to aquariums. This one is $15/person (50% military discount). We watched the Seal Show that lasted 15 minutes and then viewing the rest of the aquarium took about 6 minutes. It's very small and will not fill your day or even half your day. We like to support",
          "I really liked the aquarium but we all agree that for it's size it was overpriced at $14.95 for an adult. About 3 dozen exhibits in the downstairs with another dozen upstairs (a third of that floor is being renovated into new displays to be opened in 2019. For me, the sea lion",
          "This was very disappointing. Go to Sea World!!!!!!! Not very much acquatic life. You can see everything in 15 minutes or less. If you want an acquatic thrill of a lifetime, visit the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas. You don't have to stay there to tour their acquarium. You'll be",
          "First I have to give a shout-out to how wonderful the staff was. There was a small issue with the ticket I'd bought online and they were very helpful in getting it sorted. The aquarium is on the small side, but the exhibits are great! We caught the seal show while we were",
          "Head into this modest ( tiny ) aquarium Otherwise you can skip it It\u2019s quite the trek up a rather steep bridge to get to the other side of the road for the entrance so that might be something you need to consider depending on how mobile your group is It was modest but",
          "I think this aquarium is better suited for those with younger children. It is small, but does have some exhibits that are worth seeing. I'm glad that this was part of the Discovery pass we bought...I don't think I would have been willing to pay $14.95 per person. I think we",
          "Aquarium was very small. Admission was pretty expensive so it was still worth the visit. Maybe best for smalker kids who dont expect much. The seal feeding and sealion show are a must do, it majes it more worthwhile. The sealiin show is very tight on seeting but very well done.",
          "My kids had a good time here looking at the different sea life. The aquarium was pretty small. You could probably walk through it in about an hour and see everything. Friendly staff and very clean. It looks like the animals are well taken care of.",
          "Small Aquarium but it was very clean and has been recently renovated. All the tanks are new, and with a couple additions. We enjoyed the Q&A with some of the staff at the outdoor Seal pool that houses some non releasable seals. This was included in our discovery pass that we",
          "While the aquarium was fine, it is pretty expensive for the short amount of time you will be there unless you bought the pass. We bought the pass that included all the activities, so it was a nice break from the heat.",
          "I've been to aquariums in many cities and this is one of the smaller ones. It's nice enough, has interesting fish and marine animals, and well kept, but it just won't take you more than an hour to see it all. The seals (all of whom are rescue animals) swim in a pool outside the",
          "The aquarium is small, but it has a nice variety of the sea animals... My son loved the sea lions show, they are fun...check the schedule for the shows and feeding - it might be helpful. As far the cost goes it is a bit pricey but if you purchase the Discovery Pass it is",
          "This was a smaller aquarium that took the time to have educational programs to teach about their animal residents. It was fun and the exhibits were very nice!",
          "We weren't planning on visiting the aquarium, but after buying the Discovery Package at a discounted price, it was automatically included. It's a bit out of the way to get to, but a cute little aquarium with an exhibit outside to watch before you walked in the door. You could",
          "The aquarium was really nice with the seals as their main attraction. There was a seal show that was super cute and the kids really enjoyed it. The other tanks and exhibits were nice but more simple. They also had penguins that didn\u2019t look well. Overall we had a very pleasant",
          "We enjoyed the aquarium very much. They had a nice selection of fish, coral, and other aquariums. We were lucky enough to catch the seal show!",
          "The aquarium itself was clean but extremely small. It was not within a safe walking distance from most hotels especially with small children. If you pay for the discovery pass and it is just a extra activity then it is fine, otherwise I would not have paid for it individual or",
          "I travel over 25+ years several Countries and most cities across half the U.S. I like to visit Aquariums and Zoos and watch the personality of different animals. This place was good but small and average. Probably more enjoyable by children and small kids rather than us adults.",
          "Its an ok little aquarium but definitely not worth the price. The Sea Lion show would be great if you could actually see anything but the design of the viewing area is awful if you're not there first to get a lower level spot at the side opposite the \"stage\". I do applaud what",
          "A very nice aquarium. They had a sea lion show and many different species of fish on display. The WEGO bus will take you there from the Falls for about a twenty minute ride. Small but well done. The tanks were very clean and the animals were very well cared for. It didn\u2019t take",
          "We needed a break from 90+ temps and we found it at the aquarium. What a beautiful building! The exhibits are bright and interesting and informative. I saw things I had never seen before-fish with no eyes, live and up close sea urchins, exotic fish, seahorses...A lot of the",
          "We stopped by the aquarium as we were checking out sites along the scenic highway. We arrived just in time to catch one of the many shows in their large center tank. The small exhibits inside were very nice and crystal clear. On our way out, we were lucky enough to catch a meet",
          "We went to the aquarium as part of the Discovery Pass bundle deal. Based on some of the other reviews, we weren't sure what to expect. What we found was a small, but nice aquarium to visit. We quite enjoyed our visit. First, there is a FREE parking lot, so I would recommend",
          "I found the shows to be very informative on the animals spoke of. Was a small aquarium but felt with the purchase of DISCOVERY PASS, is was like getting in free.",
          "This Aquarium has hourly keeper talks. If you start in the morning, they start repeating at 2pm. it's a small aquarium but it's been remodeled recently and is very very nice.",
          "We weren't not able to see any of the shows that were offered, but was glad this was part of the Discover package!",
          "We visited the Aquarium while on a recent trip to Niagara Falls. I will say this is a very small aquarium with just a few things to see. Also, it does have a pretty bad smell as noted by other reviews. I would not rush to this aquarium alone, but if you are in Niagara Falls and",
          "This aquarium is rather small with not a huge variety of fish/animals. They did have some cute penguins which I enjoyed seeing. I also like love seahorses and they did have a few, but only one variety. We visited as part of the Discovery Pass. Otherwise I don\u2019t think it was",
          "It's a small aquarium with bad smell. Visited with family last week. It has Penguins, Seal, some other sea animals (Fish & Jellyfish)",
          "This is the worst aquarium we have been to. We were excited to explore some of the attractions around the falls, this being one, but out of everything this was our least favorite. They advertise as a decent sized aquarium with all sorts of sea life, well, simply put this is not",
          "The aquarium is beautifully organized, and the animals were very active. We were surprised as to how small the aquarium is but they had many shows and Hands-On activities for children. Worth checking out!",
          "The aquarium is small but a nice visit. They have rescued seals and sea lions they and will put on a show. It was a nice little place to visit. There is a fee but it helps them to continue their work.",
          "We visited the acquarium as our trolley bus took us there. It is a small acquarium and the entry fees are not worth paying for the exhibits in the acquarium. It can be avoided if time is st a premium",

          "Can walk through in a few minutes. Penquin shows - little history & feed them fish. Hour before seal show. If you go time it to at least see the seal show or can use hand stamp & go back at that time if you are nearby. Used to a large Aquarium you can spend the day at. But",
          "This is a small aquarium but we enjoyed our visit. We were there during the seal show which was fun to watch. They have a nice variety of fish to view.",
          "We went here (from Pittsburgh) excited to see the penguins and sea lions. It cost us about $60 and that was for a family of six with a discount. We have been to larger and also more moderately sized aquariums and I expected enough exhibits to entertain my family for an hour or",
          "Visited as part of the Niagara Pass. Very small but nice set up. Observed the penguin feeding and if was very informational. The seal show was awesome!!! Don\u2019t miss it!!",

          "The place is extremely small. It was a very long walk since there is no trolley stop here and we were in there maybe 10 minutes. Would not recommend.",
          "Having read other reviews, we only did this because it was part of our Discovery Pass. It is quite small and in need of renovation. We did enjoy the sea lion show. I would not purchase tickets just for this attraction, but worth a stop time permitting if you have a Discovery",

          "The Aquarium of the Niagara is a small but well maintained aquarium worth a short visit especially if you have small kids. It should be combined with the visit to the Discovery Center which is an interactive place for the kids. The aquarium has shows by Sea Horses and other",
          "Visited this place during evening time. A little bit of strenuous walk to reach this place after getting off the trolley. It is a very small aquarium and nothing great to brag about. Nothing much to see also. Any interesting show takes place at fixed times only and if we do not",
          "Small but interactive aquarium. Probably wouldn't pay extra to go visit, not enough to see and do, but as a part of the offered \"Discovery Pass\" was worth a visit. Worth an hour or so.",

          "I must admit that coming to the Aquarium of Niagara was a surprise, since there are so many other things going on in the area. There is plenty of free parking. We checked the schedule on the website, so we timed our visit to those things that we wanted to see. The aquarium is",
          "We visited the Aquarium in the summer of 2017, on a trip to Niagara from Western Massachusetts for my son's birthday. The aquarium is smallish (I've been to both larger and smaller aquariums) but has a lot of heart and is absolutely worth a visit. It's obvious the people who",
          "I remember taking trips here with my elementary school. The place seemed huge. Now that I'm older, the place is tiny! I was looking forward to going there, but was disappointed. My sister and I struggled to spend an hour there. The outdoor seals were fun to watch and the indoor",
          "It is something interesting to do when the weather is against you. Highlights of the visit was the Penguin feeding and the seal show.",

          "Aquarium of Niagara, as others have discovered, is a small facility and has relatively few species. The day we were there, the elevator was out of service \u2013 but not really a problem here as the facility on has 2 floors. There are two big tanks for penguins and seals. Lower level",
          "Brought our 10 year old granddaughter who is visiting from Delaware on her spring break and was underwhelmed. It's easy to find and there is plenty of parking and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. But the aquarium itself is very small and only 2 levels and most",
          "My wife and I were at a loss for something to do on Easter Sunday with my 5 and 2 year old with alot of places in the Buffalo/Niagara are closed. We settled on the Niagara aquarium as while I had heard mixed things about the place it was one of the only places open that appealed",

          "Aquarium is small with two floors. All exhibits were in excellent condition with many different species of fish. Great for smaller children, older ones may be bored. The penguin and sea lion shows are fun and entertaining. Staff was friendly and were happy to answer questions.",
          "Stopped by on our last day at the Falls. Unfortunately penguins were off-exhibit that day, but we did get to enjoy the sea lions swimming around in their tank, which I loved. It was also a bit crowded, and the whole thing took about an hour, but for $13 it was not bad at all.",
          "If we wouldn\u2019t have went during the sea lion show it would\u2019ve been a very worthless visit there. The sea lion show was cute. Not sure if it was worth it though:(",
          "We took our 1.5 year old as something fun to do as a family on the weekend. I was worried it wasn't going to be good, but it was GREAT. I don't normally like \"zoos\" or aquariums because I find them disheartening, but wasn't the case here - the animals are rescued and can't be",
          "Loved every moment in the Aquarium. The kids loved it to. The Sea lion show was really good and cute, super cute Penguins. Great place to go with young children.",
          "We brought a 5 and 7 year old during the winter and had an excellent few hours. The shows were excellent and the exhibits were beautifully created. This is a non profit, so the entrance fee did not feel like a waste. It will be quick so dont plan an entire day for this trip.",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos or aquariums. Seeing animals taken from the wild stuck in cages and Performing idiotic tricks for food to entertain people is not what I call entertainment. But this is different this is a non-for-profit organization with rescued animals. It's a small",
          "Very little to see and do. Horrible lighting and small exhibits. Seemed pretty the website like there was time to do and see this is not the case",
          "Nice exhibits that includes local fish. The penguin and sea lion shows are fun to watch. Very informative",
          "When you first arrive the water was green where the sea lions were, It's good for little ones for about and hour and really expensive for what they have",
          "This was not part of our itinerary but we had time to spare while waiting for our tour bus to Niagara falls. The aquarium is small but has interesting exhibits. The Humboldt penguins are adorable and we arrived in time for their feeding. There was also a sea lion show but we\u2019re",
          "This aquarium is small, but varied. The displays are well done and you can get some clear pictures. We thoroughly enjoyed the seal show from the second floor. It was very entertaining.",
          "However, I had two teens and a nine year old. It kills me to give a harsh review to an aquarium...but I am so sad that with all the tourism in that area that more isn't done to expand the aquarium or at least make it up to date. The interactive exhibits didn't work, the seals",
          "We stopped here because my son loves penguins and they have an exhibit here. Very small aquarium but we only had a couple hours and that was more than enough time to see the aquarium. The seal show was really good! Really neat that its a round pool area and you watch from",
          "We had time this past Wednesday, Thanksgiving eve, and it was cold out. They have an outside seal exhibit with a feeding demo. They also have an inside sea lion show with 3 sea lions performing various natural behaviors on comnand for smelts. They have two floors with a top",
          "We were not expecting anything big and for us it was fine. It was part of Discovery Pass so we went in, but I wouldn't go if it wasn't. It's very small, but nice made. Interesting for kids. We saw a seal show, but they have other shows too. There is a schedule at the enterance.",
          "We have taken our granddaughter here a few times now. It\u2019s small but has a lot to see. They are working on a new penguin habitat right now! It should be a much needed improvement for their large family of penguins! Lots of different large fish tanks, from local fish to the",
          "Very nice aquarium. A lot to see. Very informative. We enjoyed it a lot. Has two different floors. We took few pictures.",
          "The aquarium is very small. Not a lot to see. Definitely not worth the price. We were in and out in less than 20 minutes, total waste of time",
          "There was a lot good about the aquarium. The guides were great describing the penguins and the seals of course were fun. But many of the smaller exhibits were not labeled or obviously being redone. I'm sure by next season it will be complete and much better.",
          "This is part of the discovery pass and we had the time on our last night in the area. We got here at 4pm and were finished by 4:30. It is small. The seals are free to see in the pool on the outside of the front entrance. There was a keeper there on the way out and was",
          "Very junky aquarium!! Not worth the time. Was expecting more. We thought it was a waste of time. very limited aquatic life. Baltimore Aquarium has much more!!",
          "The aquarium is quite small. The entrance fee is 2/3 worth the price for the only attraction there which is the sea lion show which lasts 15 minutes. So time your arrival for at least 20 minutes prior tot he next show. After the show, you will only need 10 minutes for the kids",
          "We didn't plan to go to the aquarium but because we had enough time so bought the discovery pass which includes aquarium . It is very small compare to any other aquarium. But our timing was good so we watched the penguins feeding and sea lion show . The show was really good .",
          "The entire aquarium is closed off except for this tiny little section. We were in and out in 20 minutes, the penguin feeding was a joke.",
          "Don't miss this with kids or without. They have a seal show in the main pool that was worth the price of admission. I've seen a porpoise jump out of the water to reach a target up high but I had no idea a California seal could do the same thing. In fact I would say those seals",
          "This was included on the Discovery pass. Its a bit small but had a great show for children. Stay for the show if you have the time. its only about 20 to 30 minutes, but its worth it. the trolley stops nearby. Then a quick walk over a bridge to the aquarium.",
          "We only went to the Aquarium because it was included as part of our Discovery Pass. And admission appears expensive, so I'm not sure that it is worth it otherwise. But given a free admission, we did enjoy the experience. They had shows/keeper talks with the seals, penguins, and",
          "There's a good deal of construction going on and not much to see. But they are charging the same price. I won't go back until the work is done.",
          "It's a small aquarium, if you are fish lover, you can visit it, we purchased discovery pass and this was part of it, so we. Visited this place too.. and it was good..",
          "The aquarium was very disappointing. We paid $56 (and that was with one free admission) for 6 people. It only took 20 minutes to go through. The cost of admission is ridiculous. The seals outside were free to look at and adorable, it was the best part.",
          "The aquarium is quaint. Very small, but fun. It was nice watching the seals and sea lions. It is really cool that the animals that are there are ones that have been \"saved and rehabilitated",

          "A quick walk from the falls, if you have time, do squeeze it into your schedule, especially if you are traveling with children...Children will love the seal show, and feeding the seals. Do check the timings of the seal show and/or the feeding times. There are fixed time slots,",
          "We made it just in time for the sea lion show. This is a very small aquarium and can be seen in about 30 minutes. Not worth it without the show.",
          "We only came here as it was included in our discovery pass. I wish we hadn't as it was upsetting. The seals had an enclosure that wasn't even the size of a regular swimming pool. They had one platform to sit on. Maybe this meets regulations but it's still not right. These",
          "There was very little to see but what they had was nice. Construction was going on on the outside of the building but everything kind of had a little run down look to it. The sea lions and seals were fun.",
          "We stopped here because my grand-daughter requested it. They have sea lion shows & penquin feeding several times daily. I have seen a few sea lion shows & I wasn't impressed with this one, also not enough seating & not able to see well due to that. However, my grand-daughter",
          "When I was a kid, my family use to make regular visits to the Niagara aquarium. I use to really love every visit. On my last visit I was a little sadden to see how small it seems. At the point of our visit there was remodeling going on. Hearing all the work being done made it a",
          "We went the the aquarium primarily because it was part of the discovery pass and becase it was raining outside. It is very small but the staff were engaging and the kids enjoyed the up close look at the fish and sea lions.",
          "Very small, i should have looked into this destination much more prior to committing to the drive and high admissions costs. We spent 10 minutes yet spent $49 on parking and admission.",
          "it was a pretty nice small aquarium only had 2 floors not much to see it is ok sea lion show is pretty good for $53 for a family of 5 was not a bad price..",
          "We had read that this aquarium was really good, granted there was construction while we were there but we spent less than 30 minutes and had seen the entire place. The tanks were small and some were dirty. I was really expecting something much better so hopefully the",
          "The aquarium is one of the things included on the Discovery Pass and I think it is worth going, but would not have wanted to pay separately to go. It is very small, but the staff seem kind and seem to know what they are doing, but don't go expecting a huge aquarium with all of",
          "Not much to see for an Aquarium, we didn't stay long. Nothing that interest us at all, we've been to some better and bigger Aqaurium but if you have some little kids im sure they will enjoy the place.",
          "There was a sea lion show, lasted 10ish minutes that was cute to watch. Rest of the place would take maybe a 10-15 minute walk through.",
          "We went with the Niagara Discovery passes. Plan to spend an hour or two. Go early when it opens if you like it less crowded. Got very busy mid day. Parking is just $5. There is a pedestrian walkway to access the Niagara Gorge Discovery Center. Trolley stops there. Sea lion show",
          "Great little aquarium. New seal pup was adorable. Great sea lion show! Great deal when you buy the passes for all the attractions!",
          "Not as big as other aquariums I have visited. Not as many animals as you would have liked to see. Need to do a better job of identifying the creatures on exhibit. Doen't take long to get through the aquarium. Price is ok for what you get.",
          "Very small aquarium with mostly rescued seals. Two very cut shows with the different seals. Enjoyable, and entertainingly.",
          "This is definitely the worst aquarium I've ever been to. The animals look very unhappy in their small exhibits.. especially the seals outside do not have enough water to swim in. Also the fish have no water plants but only rocks in their aquariums, there are hardly any so they",
          "They claim they are fresh water but they have seals..... very confusing.... also not well ventilated. We were very hot. We found it small but big giftshop",
          "We went to this aquarium since it was part of our pass. Our son loves penguins so we thought we would go to see the penguins. He was so sad to see the small temporary habitat they were in. They looked sickly. We hope they get a bigger space soon! The best part was the four",
          "Even though this Aquarium is small (first in the US), it worth the time to visit. We had a Discovery Pass so it was included in the package. The highlight was the sea lions and seals that call this aquarium home. They are so personable and fun to watch - definitely the best part",
          "We visited this place today and I was disappointed. They are more focused on your money, then they are the animals. On our way to the entrance we passed an outdoor sea lion habitat. The tank was way to small for the sea lions and there was six of them in it. The biggest sea lion",
          "The aquarium was very disappointing. Enclosures were way too small for the animals. There is a seal lion enclosure located outside, the tank was incredibly small and there were 6 sea lions in it! One of the sea lions was so big he couldn't even swim around. The animals were",
          "Disappointing. The animals are poorly cared for. Enclosures are too small. And there were too many in one tank. During one of the shows they started blaring music and had flashing lights in the sea lion tank, the music was way too loud for humans, the sound inside the tanks had",
          "Smallish aquarium but the price is right compared to other aquariums around the country. Standard aquarium displays but well put together and a unique layout. Watched the seals being fed and learned that they are all being rehabilitated due to injuries in the wild. The penguin",
          "This is a fun place and rarely busy. Great fun for the kids. Even teenagers can have fun. Keep this small place in business please!",
          "This was one of the attractions included in our Discovery Passes. My kids wanted to go, so we took the Trolley there. As we started following signs for the Aquarium, we realized that it is quite a distance away from the trolley stop...up hill and over a bridge! Not good on",
          "There wasn't very much to see, mostly fish. The tanks weren't very big & the animals seemed \"zombied\". I love penguins & there was a temporary tank with 6 penguins. They all were just staring at the wall, except when they were biting themselves like they had bugs. The sea",

          "A run down, small throw back to the early 1960s. A real bore. Mostly fish tanks. Animals like seals and penguins are in habitats no modern day eco minded person would approve of. The only advantage is, it's near an elevator that takes you down to the river with",
          "There isn't a lot to really see. It's kinda only worth it as part of the discovery pass. The seal show was a must see!",
          "The seal show was the best part but we were hoping for more of a water show. They mostly did tricks standing on a platform. The penguin feeding was boring. Not much else. Didn't stay long and would have not gone if it wasn't included in the Discovery pass.",
          "This aquarium could use a lot if maintenance. Very poor looking attraction. The penguins looked unhealthy. Very small viewing area. Very disappointed.",
          "This aquarium is ok for a few minutes but it's sad. The animals are very confined. I wouldn't buy an individual ticket for this. It's located near the Discovery center which is more interesting.",
          "Smallest aquarium I've ever been to I think. We got there just in time for the Sea Lion show, which compared to Sea World was much more up close and personal. It was very fun to see. Otherwise the exhibits are average, and there isn't much to see. Glad it was included as",
          "Had a great time at this aquarium. Very busy day, but the staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable. Talked with the summer intern about the baby seal and she provided a lot of information. It's obvious these staff love what they do. Reasonably priced and well worth it",
          "We bought a package deal that included the aquarium. It's very small and not a lot of animals. Would not have been happy if I had paid extra for it. But, kids would enjoy it.",
          "This was a weekend trip and on our lists of stops. Very small and crowded. The price is acceptable. Location is convenient from hotels and the falls.",
          "The aquarium is small but we enjoyed it. The glass was clean and we'll maintain. The seals show was informative. For an extra fee ($10.00) the kids can hold a boa constrictor or a parrot and have their picture made. You can spend a good hour or longer there. Little kids",
          "The aquarium is tiny but all the tanks were immaculately clean and the marine life looked healthy and well cared for. The most exciting was the baby harbor seal that had just been born. A good stop for an hour or so.",
          "Unless you buy the discovery pass I don't really think it's worth it. It was the smallest aquarium we have ever been to and if it wasn't for the sea lions and seals it definitely wouldn't have been any good. Hopefully it'll be a lot better and bigger after the construction",
          "My wife and I visited the aquarium and enjoyed the sea lion show very much. The staff were very friendly, answering any questions we had. There are several displays that are very informative and interesting. It is not an all day adventure , but it is great for a couple hour",
          "I bought the Discovery Pass which included the Aquarium. I had no idea the Aquarium was under construction & some of it was closed off so what we did get to see was limited. It was a small Aquarium (not sure of size when all is open). It wasn't worth the money at this time, I",
          "A family bought the $45 ticket pack (not worth it) n was leaving n gave us the rest of the tickets, one was for the aquirium. The parking lot was empty yet still had to pay $5 to park in it. The sea lion show was super cute . They have a very small tide pool w star fish,",

          "By aquarium standards, this one is small and does not have much in the way of species variety. The sea lion show was cute but it's hard to know they do not have a very nice habitat. While we were visiting, there was a lot of construction going on with continual jackhammering.",
          "This was included in our discovery pass and was very disappointing. Its very small and the only show was the sea lions and we couldn't see it at all. There is just not a lot to see. There are adorable penguins but the young man working in with them seemed bored out of his mind!",
          "Some of the exhibits can be seen at other larger aquariums, would of like to seen more fish or aquatic creatures from the surrounding area instead of the normal salt water creatures. If the schedule show is cancelled for the day would of like to known ahead of time, instead of",

          "Kinda old, kinda small, but cute little Aquarium where animals are well taken care of. The walk, even from the trolley, the fruit wasn't worth the squeeze. It was part of the Discovery Pass, I wouldn't probably go as a stand alone attraction.",
          "Very small. Loved the seal show and the penguins. They have many varieties of fish. Turtles were really cute. For what they have it was nice.",
          "Not fancy! However the aquarium of Niagara has their heart in the right place is providing a great educational experience while saving sea creatures",
          "I cannot believe they even calls this an aquarium. This is mostly a gift shop with fish on display. Save your time and money and do not go here.",
          "Sea lion show is good, like a mini version from sea world shows. Most exhibits are closed for renovation and about 20 or so exhibits are available to see. Also restrooms are out of order for renovation and a mobile unit is parked near the parking lot. Visited this aquarium",
          "We really enjoyed this. Lots to see and was the highlight of the whole trip for my six year old niece.",
          "If this wasn't included in the Discovery Pass I would say skip it. They are currently under construction and it's in a pretty sad state. There are very few exhibits to view. They charge $5 to park in their parking lot. If you plan to visit, park at the Discovery Center and use",
          "It was very close to the niagara falls so we visited it. There wasnt anything much to see or learn just some sea lions fishes and skeleton of California sea lion. We were able to finish it within 30mins. There were some shows with sea lions at particular times of a day. If u r",
          "Worth a visit if you have kids and are going to the discovery center anyway. Could do the whole thing in an hour. Kids enjoyed themselves, especially the sea lion show.",

          "My husband and I had gone to the Maid of the Mist and thought we would go check out the Aquarium too since we got the tickets through the Discovery Pass. We were SO disappointed at what we found or should I say didn't find at this Aquarium. I have seen more fish at a fish store",
          "I found this attraction to be nothing more than a tourist trap. Expect to be done with looking in around 10 minutes. VERY small place that funnels as many through as they can for the cash. They charge for parking also.",
          "which is why my friend and I went. We were visiting the US side of Niagara Falls and it started to rain and we were near the aquarium so we decided to visit it. Huge amounts of money (over two million dollars, I think) were recently spent on a new penguin exhibit. Visitors",
          "Small and outdated. Not much to see. Can explore the entire thing in 15 minutes. We only went because we had tickets as part of the Discovery pass. However I would not buy tickets for it separately. Not worth it.",
          "I should first say I'm spoiled because I come from a city with the best zoo in the country and the state with one of the best aquariums in the country. That being said, we stopped here because it was part of the Discovery package that we had. I believe regular trips cost $13",
          "The aquarium is very small. But the best part of the visit was the sea lion show. My kids and I enjoyed it so much.",
          "Like the Discovery Center, the Aquarium is old and outdated. If this wasn't included in the Discovery Pass, I never would have went in with the kids. It is a .5 mile walk or trolley ride from where the Falls are. Some of the \"exhibits\" upstairs were empty. They did a live sea",
          "My 2 grandsons loved the show with the sea lions! It was very very captivating to see the trainers and these marvelous creatures interact, very fun show indeed, they do have other types of shows also with penguins, we missed that show! Very glad to have seen this show..",
          "This is a very small aquarium with a few animals. We were able to visit with our Discovery Pass. I don't think I would have spent extra money just for this attraction. The sea lions and penguins were cute but the exhibits were small and not very well cared for.",
          "I was skeptical at first as I haven't been to many aquariums before, but I must say it was very much enjoyable! The penguins and sea lions were probably my favorite. I highly recommend going here! Especially if you have children.",
          "This was the 1st place my husband and I visited after getting to Niagara. It was a let down. Very small, not a lot of marine life. The seals were the best part. The penguins were in a temporary habitat, there was construction going on so things were torn up. We walked quiet a",
          "The place was dirty, very few exhibits. Workers not friendly, when purchased tickets wasn't even told thank you or which way to go. Would not recommend this place at all. Save your money",
          "We love seeing the penguins and all the different fish. It was a very nice to take our time and see everything you had to offer and all the help you give the animals.",
          "Went on a family vacation with my brother's and sister's families 13 of us with kids ranging in age from 6 to 16. The seal show was their favorite part of the trip.",
          "Because it was part of the Discovery Pass we went to this. It is small but still nice. The Sea Lions are entertaining. You should try to catch the short but worth it show.",
          "We went here to just pass some time. So glad we did too. They have awesome exhibits and in the front when you come in they have the sea lions. My friend and I couldn't get over one sea lion that just sat there up right and didnt move til the trainers came out. You could tell",
          "I was so disappointed by this aquarium. The exhibits were dirty and some of them upstairs were hard to see into. The Sea Lions outside were kept in a very small pool, especially for five animals. Also, the penguin exhibit was very small and disgusting because their new exhibit",
          "This was not worth the trip. We had the Discovery Pass so we decided to stop in. Disappointing is an understatement. I would have been incredibly upset to pay for this place. I felt terrible for the few animals they had. Their \"habitats\" were small and dirty. They barely had",
          "My one year old had a good time looking at the fish tanks. It's a very small aquarium. The sea lion show was good and entertaining. If not for the show I would have been disappointed. We spent about an hour here. It's not stroller friendly at all unfortunately. I was alone and",
          "After crossing the rainbow bridge into the US from Canada we were looking for something not too far away to entertain us for the afternoon and so came here. It is a very small aquarium, but they do have sea lions, penguins and seals which the Ripley's Aquarium of Canada did not.",
          "This was an extremely small aquarium. We walked around it and we were done in about 30 minutes. We watched the seal show and we weren't able to hear what she was saying because her microphone went out. I wouldn't recommend this aquarium.",
          "One of the best shows I've seen at an aquarium. Smaller aquarium. It was the perfect size to so one last stop prior to hitting the road for the drive home",
          "This was the only part of the trip that was a tad disappointing . The aquarium was aged and the displays were limited. The PLUS of the location were the people working there. These folks were very friendly and more than willing to answer any and all questions.",
          "It was enjoyable. It is a distance away. I walked there with my father. Luckily you can take a trolley back that is included with the Discovery Pass.",
          "Place is small and overpriced with barely any animals. Main attraction is a seal show which is not very impressive. Definitely will not recommend",
          "I thought the Aquiruim was ok was expecting to see more animals but other wise I thought it was ok specially for little children,..",
          "Seen one aquarium, seen them all so to speak This is a good place to take the kids and it is included in the discount pass.",
          "I can't stop talking about the seal show. I was really impressed with the show and the tricks. I thought it was going to be boring but I was pleasantly surprised. A must see when visiting",
          "We visited the aquarium to kill time before dinner. Nothing spectacular, but wasn't expecting anything spectacular. Was waiting to see a sea lion show but they only had a Q&A regarding the mammals. Spent about 1 hour there. It was nice to see but probably wouldn't visit it",
          "The aquarium was smaller than I expected. The bathrooms didn't have toilet paper. The sea lions were so cute, as were the penguins.",
          "This is a great show and educational for the family. The location is perfect and they allow RV parking overnight so we parked our 40 foot bus in the parking lot for a few days and walked all around both sides of the bridge...great location and it is awesome that they allow RV",
          "Me and my family visited the Aquarium of Niagara on our recent vacation to the Falls. It was a small aquarium but they have an awesome sea lion pool directly in the middle. Many times in a day they have a sea lion show, our kids enjoyed it. They also have a seal exhibit located",
          "While visiting the falls there wasn't a lot to do. We decided to give this a try. The Sea Lions outside were adorable I would have been fine seeing this free portion and leaving, their pool is small and there are too many of them in this pool where they remain all year round.",
          "My wife and I recently visited the Aquarium of Niagara on our recent vacation to the Falls. Our opinion? It is small but well worth the price. They have a number of aquariums thru out the attraction with a sea lion pool directly in the middle. A number of times a day they have",
          "Having been to both aquariums in Long Beach and Monterey, this one seemed a little underwhelming. However, with that being said, the staff here was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The aquarium is pretty small and can be completed easily in less than an hour. They do have",
          "The sea lion show is great but after that you can complete your trip in under an hour, We love the seals outside but their pool is tiny. We love nature but sometimes we leave here sad.",
          "We went to the aquarium for the first time on Saturday. Where the facility is interesting it is rather small and not stroller or wheelchair friendly to get in. They do have an elevator but it is out of order and the hallways are quite narrow. My 13 month old daughter loved the",
          "I am from Chicago so maybe I got used to the Shedd aquarium that is why I think this was a very, very small place that you can finish in less than an hour. They have a few seals outside that you can look at without paying the entrance fee of $13/person, and childredn under 2 are",
          "Traveled here with my family, including children(2 & 7), and we all left a little underwhelmed for the cost of admission ($35 for the four of us as my youngest was free). Expect to spend an hour at most here, as it's VERY small, even my 7 that is extremely into animals & fish",
          "We were headed home from Niagara Falls, and decided to make a stop here. I really don't like giving negative reviews, but I was really disappointed. I knew it wasn't a large facility but I wasn't prepared for exactly how small it was. It was about $54 for our family of four and",
          "A bit pricey for what you see and get. Needs updating but my 12 year fish lover enjoyed it for about 30 minutes.",
          "Way overpriced!! I have seen better at my local free zoo. The place looks run down and it's tiny. For a touristy area they could put money in it to make it better.",
          "If you have ever been to an aquarium before, do not pay to go to this one. It is at most an hour activity (that included time waiting for the two short shows) so for the price, you are better off at the Bird Kingdom or Butterfly Conservatory. If you have kids younger than 6, it",
          "My two complaints are that the coupon buy one get one free only allowed the child in for free instead of another adult and during the seal show the rock music was way too loud before the show and the music during the show was too loud. Also too much advertising during the show.",
          "The sea lion show was cute! They were in the middle of construction for the new penguin display & the drilling/noise was LOUD & disruptive. It was much smaller than I expected & there wasn't a lot to see compared to aquariums I've been to in the past. It was good enough to make",
          "I took the twins to the Aquarium for the day. We had a wonderful time. We spent about five hours there. we got to see all of the sea life, seals, dolphines. turtles and all the wonderful fishes, there were so many attractions to enjoy and it was absolutely wonderful. For the",
          "We went with our preteen/teen daughters. They always enjoy it. There's always new things to see - Sea Lion show, seal encounter, behind the scenes tours. This time we watched the penguin feeding. They also have a new salt water reef exhibit. Our favorite thing to do is the Touch",
          "This was my second visit and I remembered it being a bit bigger and more fun. The Sea Lion show is nice, but last time had an art therapy program for the Sea Lion's and sold \"art\" by them. No mention of that this time. It's worth a visit if you've never been, but probably not",
          "My kids (6 and 12) were very satisfied. We were fortunate enough to be able to witness the shark feeding. The seals in the center of the aquarium are so very friendly and entertaining - I could have watched them for hours. Reasonably priced - will be better once the new penguin",
          "The visit to the aquarium was a nice side attraction from the Falls. This attraction speaks mostly to little children, although we enjoyed the sea lion show.",
          "children or no children you gotta stop and see the aquarium it is for everyone i was very pleased the shows of live intertainment great",
          "This aquarium is not huge, but it is still a nice place for a day visit. The sea lion show is really fun, and right now they have a sweet baby sea lion who is only a few months old! They are doing construction building a new penguin habitat, but the construction is not at all",
          "We have an aquarium in our hometown, & this could barely even be considered an aquarium compared to that. Niagara aquarium cost $13 a person (so we paid $26) & we stayed for all of 20 minutes. They had one true exhibit, which was a pool for the seals, & we saw them feed the 3",
          "The sea lion show was fun for our grandchildren. The exhibits were well done. However, the property is in need of repair and updating.",
          "Been here multiple times. Enjoy Everytime. They have a small touch tank and some great exhibits. The shows are fun. Been to a few aquariums and this is by far our favorite.",
          "We visited this aquarium because it was part of our discovery pass. It was very small and the exhibits were well maintained but the staff didn't know anything about them, at least the day we were there. My husband, a marine biologist, asked a staff member about the lighting for",
          "We love aquariums and wish this one had more to offer. We enjoyed seeing what they had on display and enjoyed our time there but this location is quite small and is very limited.",
          "This aquarium is very small. You can thoroughly look at all the exhibits in about an hour. That said all the fish and other animals appear to be happy and well taken care of. There is a small touch tank area that kids will enjoy.",
          "Fun little aquarium! My wife and I stopped in just before we left Niagara Falls and went home -- we paid for the seal and sea lion performance and it was completely worth the price! We spent a little extra time getting to hear the stories of the different aquatic mammals",
          "Beautiful aquarium with different kinds of fish, crabs, seals, frogs, seahorses, etc. Very clean and beautiful environment. Very recommended for all ages.",
          "Although I enjoyed it I did not like seeing the sea lions and seals in such cramped conditions. They have a large variety of fish, I have decided to no longer support aquariums or zoo's. However this one is better than most.",
          "We had an excellent visit to the Aquarium! the Sea Lions were cool and we loved the touch tank!! They are under construction for the new Humboldt Penguin Exhibit, so a big chunk was sectioned off for that. Otherwise a terrific afternoon at the aquarium!",
          "We had some one to kill so attended the aquarium about 25min walk from the falls, nice, small aquarium with some nice exhibits. Knowledgable staff. Worth a trip, especially the seal show.",
          "- Nice aquarium and nice show - Sea lion show is amazing show - Nice staff - Good for all ages - - - - - - - - - - - -",
          "This was part of our \"Pass\" bundle. I would definitely take the kids here for the show and to see the fish, sharks, etc.",
          "Unfortunately, this aquarium is very tiny and lacking many exhibits. The sea lion show was entertaining but that's the only thing worth seeing and lasts under a half hour. The penguins are housed in a very small area. This is under reservation so hopefully the new penguin",
          "Cute little Aquarium. Not a big place but still interesting. Staff were helpful and gift shop was cute. Love the animals and they seem to be fairly well cared , premises were clean. Inexpensive and worth a little visit :)",
          "As other stated this Aquarium is quite small and currently under renovation. Once the new penguin exhibit goes in expect better experience. Wife wanted to see the octopus, who was not on display due to contraction. The staff is very attentive and sea lion show was great for",
          "We went to watch the seal show. I thought it was quite pricey for such a small aquarium. I guess the money goes to a good cause, but the seal show was quick, and then you could see the whole place within 1/2 hour, and that's if you're taking your time.",
          "We were staying in Buffalo and thought we'd go to the falls - but it was cold and windy on 12/31/16...so we opted for the aquarium. Yes - it is in a poor part of town - signage in the parking lot tells you to be sure to lock your car doors. We had no problem and saw no signs",
          "Let me start off by saying this place was legit the best part of travels to Niagara Falls. We went on the Sea lion encounter! We met zoey who was just wonderful. The trainers there were so friendly and answers all or questions. They had zoey give us \"nuzzles\" which was beyond",
          "Go see if you have kids who would like to see a short dolphin show and some varieties of fish. Nothing spectacular here.",
          "The price for adults is $13, but the day we went their largest exhibit and centerpiece of the building, was under construction, so tickets were half off. There were 4 seals outside in a small pool. The aquarium is small, especially with the huge seal tank emptied. We saw",
          "Where do I begin? The location doesn't seem safe by looking at that area and the aquarium has several cameras on the building facing the parking lot so that says it's a bad area for crime. The facility is old and needs updating and was too expensive for such a small pathetic",
          "Found this place looking for stuff to do in the area. The neighborhood around it didn't seem like the best of places but we were pleased with the aquarium itself. It was under renovation when we went so the big tank in the middle was drained but it was also half price entry to",
          "This quaint little aquarium isn't worth the ticket price. It is well kept and had a nice show, but that was an extra ticket to enter. If you have a need to get indoors out of the weather, I recommend it. A clean bathroom and cheap sodas are nice. Plus with only one door in or",
          "We bought a combo pass at the Niagara US Visitor center and it was a good deal including the trolley. Maid of the Mist, Cave of the Winds, and the Aquarian and Discovery center. First of all, the aquarium had very few exhibits. There were a few seals, but they were not in the",
          "The sea otters are the main attraction but it is so small other then the 15 minute sea otter show which is great. Just basic fish, jellyfish but there were penguins they definitely need a bigger habitat (which I think they in the process of building) price was 14 a piece. Took",
          "I really liked the Sea Lion show. It is a must watch. People who would have not seen Sea Lions before will like this place.",
          "This has got to be the smallest aquarium I have ever visited in my life! You could go threw it in less than an hour. I love aquariums, but I would never recommend anyone go to this one. Sorry.",
          "Went with my wife found it small but well worth it , staff very friendly and approachable found a lot of different fish species to look at as well as penguins and seals and a sealion up close .",
          "The aquarium is opposite to Niagara Gorge center accessible by crossing a overhead bridge. Aquarium is pretty small but well organized.",
          "Aquarium is a great stop if you have time on your trip. Its a small venue but have a good amount of animals to see and visit. Seals are very active and fun to watch. Their penguin exhibit is great and the biologists are very informative and friendly. Glad to hear that they are",
          "This aquarium been part of the package makes it worth visiting and the seal show should not be missed.",
          "This aquarium is nice and they have a good show but it is small with little to do. It isn't bad, we were just expecting a lot more.",
          "Not the largest aquarium we have been to but we were impressed by the exhibits. Some species we had not seen before. Worth the time to go",
          "My boyfriend and I went recently. There were a couple of great displays. They had seals, sea lions and penguin interactions and feedings periodically through the day. We watched the sea lion show. It was informative and entertaining. This venue is mostly for children. But the",
          "Not a lot of selection here to see but the sea lion show is entertaining for younger children. No large species. They are planning expansion and it needs it. I would only recommend this if you have the Discovery Pass and it's already included. With the show (only at certain",
          "I expected more for our $13 admission. We were shocked it was so small. The sea lion show was good. If you are going and plan to go on the Maid of the Mist and do Cave of the Winds then buy the package deal at the falls.",
          "Came early morning due to rainy weather..reasonable rate and lots of fun things to do. Very informative..especially shark feedings.",
          "The ticket is included if you have a discovery pass Its not a big place and have some amazing corals and fishes to view They also have a show which if you time perfect one can enjoy the seals in actions here",
          "This is not a big aquarium and there is not much to see overall. I was also sad to see that the animals are kept in small enclosures.",
          "We had a great time with our Girl Scout troop! We spent the night and were welcomed by friendly staff members. The girls were kept busy all night with pizza and trivia, crafts, touch tanks, movies and much more! We woke up early to a quick breakfast and the best sea lion",
          "This is not the largest aquarium we've ever been to but it is very quaint and full of quirky things. Purchase the Discovery Pass and save money.",
          "We spent about an hour and a half here and caught two seal and sea lion shows. The aquarium was included with the discovery pass. The full day with toddlers included a trolley ride, aquarium, and the cave of the winds. It was perfect.",
          "This attraction is another fun thing to do while at the falls and want some extra things to do. This is included in the Discovery Pass for the American side which we purchased. Not very big compared to other aquariums, but they do have a live seal show which was neat to see.",
          "The seal show was amazing we enjoyed this totally. Good for all ages. so much to see such a amazing day",
          "This aquarium is not the largest aquarium, but it's got a lot packed into the room that it does have. The displays were colorful, clean and filled with interesting fish and sea life. The Seal and Sea lion presentation was informative and entertaining. My kids are still",
          "If you have been to good aquariums like Cincinnati, Chicago, Florida-Tampa, then set your expectations real low. Otherwise you are in for a disappointment. The value of this place is your kids might want to visit an aquarium while you are in that area and this is for that!",
          "It smells very fishy right when you enter the building and it remains. There were shows for the seals but we weren't there at the right time. The building is a bit old and the aquarium was very small. There is a 2nd floor but it is mostly just an area to watch the show nothing",
          "Although the wait for the seal and sea lion show was about 45 minutes before the show itself, it was well worth the opportunity to see them perform. Many interesting facts about fish and their habitat with many displays. Staff very helpful and there is free parking.",
          "I love this aquarium The best especially the gift shop front desk workers they are so helpful with information on everything and are very nice people. Will be visiting again soon!",
          "Not a large aquarium by average standards - but the sea lions were really neat. Shows with them are given during the day. Kids enjoyed and did not take up a lot of time.",
          "Loved the seal show! This place is in dire need of a renovation though!!! We hope Niagara Falls New York steps up there game as this could be a wonderful place",
          "Unfortunately, this aquarium is \"tired\" and outdated. Most of what you see if a few sea lions and fish. Most of the exhibits are small and the area is pretty crowded. The most worthwhile part of the attraction is the amazing mural on the outside wall of the whale..done in full",
          "This was a highlight to our visit, we fell in love with sea lions and penguins. Great for children too.",
          "I really enjoy aquariums and have visited many. I desperately wanted to like this aquarium because they are an important education tool. Unfortunately I found this aquarium to be lacking. For that I am sad. It is an old rounded building in a downtrodden neighborhood. There",
          "This Aquarium, although interesting, is rather small. I was finished with the entire building (Two Floors) in approximately one hour. The attraction is a bit of a walk from the main tourist area of Niagara Falls, New York.",
          "It was fun with the family and the experience was ok. Really it was a hot day and it was air conditioned. Not much to see, but clean and nice people. The sea lion show was the best BY FAR!!!!",
          "Penguins were favorite along with NEMO. Small enough and easy to get around yet big enough to hold their attention. Second visit and we will return.",
          "Nice Aquarium in Niagra Falls. Easy walk from the state park. Inexpensive. Nice place for children and adults. Watch the penguin feeding. Seals put on a show for all. Fun.",
          "I can't say how upset and disturbing it was to walk into that place. The smell was terrible as soon as you walked in. We hope this is not part of the National Parks because it needs to be overhauled or closed. Most of the exhibits were empty and the ones that were not were",
          "Considering worlds biggest fall beside this looks smaller of attraction, but us good. Best part is the show so try and catch it up.",
          "Very small aquarium. The animals there did seem well taken care of. It was a nice break from being outside all day. If this attraction weren't included in our Discovery Pass, I would've been disappointed paying a separate admission fee to get in. Maybe younger children would be",
          "My family really enjoyed our experience at the aquarium. We watched the sea lion show, which was a lot of fun. We also paid a small additional fee and attended an educational show including snakes, a tortoise and a cavy. The building is currently small and there aren't a lot of",
          "It is a small aquarium with different aquatic mammals and fish. The only mammals are harbor seal and sea lions in a too small enclosure. It was $39 for 3 adults...a little pricey. We were in and out in less then an hour.",
          "Same as usual aquariums that we have on USA in each state .. Sea lion show is special so don't miss it .. 11 AM first show and then at 3 I guess so plan accordingly .. Enjoy the trip guys!!",
          "Have been here a couple of times now. Most recently in January 2016, the time before was May 1994. Enjoyed it just as much the second time around! Friendly staff.",
          "Maybe better for families with younger kids. But my 15 year old and I enjoyed the sea lion show. My 13 year old was bored but that's him with any things these days.",
          "A nice little aquarium. For the price of admission the aquarium is small. They do a really cool sea lion show so make sure if you go you make sure to plan it to see this!!",
          "We did this entire aquarium in about an hours time which included a 20min sea lion presentation. A lot of exhibits were being torn down or cleaned. We went because it was apart of the Discovery USA pass, otherwise I would never pay $13 per person to do this. The sea lions",
          "This is a small aquarium, We toured for less than 2 hours, but staff were super friendly and willing to answer visitors questions. The aquarium has a full schedule of events through out the day.",
          "I am always fascinated with aquarium and the fishes, different types, gorgeous to watch and relaxing, they have an Seals preforming a show, nice gift shop, the walk over the bridge to the aquarium, was a bit tiring after a full day of walking around",
          "I have been to a few aquariums and this is FAR FAR FAR from an aquarium. I feel for the animals they have in captivity, their living quarters are SMALL. The seal show is cute, but he doesn't have enough room to be a seal and enjoy life. It's a small place to begin with so do not",
          "Not a lot to see, probably best for kids who will be able to see a good variety of live sea animals. It only took us 45 minutes to see it, but there is a live show with the seals that we did not stay for.",
          "Aquarium of Niagara is not your typical giant sea aquarium that you would get from Miami or Pittsburgh or elsewhere. So you have to go in with a mindset that you are not going to be blown away or all you will do is complain the whole time. The admission is $13 and I think it is",
          "The sea lion show made this small aquarium worthwhile. Free parking. We wanted to spend the day on the NY side of the falls and this was a good indoor activity to mix up the day.",
          "we heard great things about this aquarium and shuffled things to make time for it on the way back to NYC from Canada. We were sorely disappointed... It's really small, not very updated, and confusing as to where the exhibit actually starts. Not at all worth the $13 entrance",
          "We went to see the sealion/seal show on a day they were to perform and didn't get to see it because they decided to clean there area. The feeding of the sharks consists of you watching the trainers throw them some fish. We were disappointed .",
          "We've been spoiled by visiting the great aquariums in Atlanta and Monterrey so we didn't have high hopes for this one. It was part of the Discovery Pass package so we went. Nice sea lion pool and a few interesting exhibits in a fairly small space. The kids there seemed to be",
          "Close enough to the trolley stop at the discovery center that you should not pass this one up! The trainers and the work they have done with the sea lions is most impressive! I only wish the exhibits would be a bit more polished. Quite a few of the tanks had lights out making",
          "We went here when we went on vacation to Niagara Falls and it's not worth visiting we were done seeing everything in about 10 or 15 minutes not wort the time best part was the seals out front in the water",
          "This is a nice Aquarium. You will see some really interesting water life here. The children will really enjoy this adventure, they even have the family fish from the movie \"Finding Nemo \" !",
          "Not what we expected for an Aquarium. Smallest we've ever seen. The smell was terrible. We completed the tour in all of 20 mins.",
          "The aquarium is all rescue animals which is awesome, but it is kind of small. We had the discovery pass so the aquarium was included so we really enjoyed it. They also do shows during the day and most of them are free so we got to see the sea lion show and that was a lot of fun.",
          "Small but nice. There are a few interactive displays as well as a sea-lion show. Some good displays of the different types of tropical fish, sea anemones, turtles, starfish, octopus, etc. Outside there is a pool with a couple of different types of rescue sea lions. This only",
          "Not our favorite. Was small with a big seal tank in the middle. Out of the way. Took trolley to the site and walked over a steep bridge to get there.",
          "While we were in Niagara Falls, we decided to visit the aquarium and were very disappointed by it. There were tanks of fish that could be seen in any aquarium, the sea lion show was not very interesting, and you had to pay extra for the animal encounter sessions. The price was",
          "If you are expecting a great big aquarium you'll be disappointed. I was actually surprised how small it is. It is cute and probably better suited to young children who would get bored with a larger aquarium.",
          "It's not very big. You can go through it within an hour. If you do other things or stay for their show, it might take a little longer. It's a short from the Discovery center. You have to walk up a ramp that goes over the road beneath so that you could cross over to the other",
          "this is a definate must, my grandchildren loved this it was well worth the money, the show that they put on was awesome! we will definately be back here ago,",
          "It's a small aquarium. It cost 13.00 a person to get in but it's worth it. The show with the seals is a must see. They were so cute doing their tricks. There's also a small gift shop there.",
          "It was nice and the staff was wonderful. The touch tank was fun for the kids 11 and 8 years old. The sea lion show was a blast. But it really small and it doesn't have enough room to stand and watch the show's and the animal feeding. Best advice I can give is to show up early.",
          "Not among the best ones. Cannot compare to Atlanta. The admission fee is included in the Niagara Discovery Pass, and my 5yr old son loves aquariums..so we visited. You can take the trolley ride to this stop, and overall it's OK. But if I were to pay separately for this, we may",
          "It's a small aquarium but nice. They have a good display of sharks hanging from the ceiling. Mostly smaller tanks. They did have a sealion show. For a small aquarium, it is well kept. It was $13 for adults. We were there about an hour and enjoyed it",
          "We love to visit aquariums and this one was very disappointing for us. Very few marine life and the sea lion show was ok.",
          "We visited this attraction because the ticket came with the discovery pass we bought. I am glad we didn't pay for it separately; it was fairly small and really didn't have a lot to see. An hour was plenty of time to see it all.",
          "We bought the the Discovery Pass and the aquarium came with it, This is the smallest aquarium I have ever seen!! Penguins, seals, an octopus and fish. They did have a seal show but the place is just sad!!",
          "Nice place that is suitable specialy for kids. I would recommend to take the 5 attractions deal include \"cave of the winds\", \"made of the mist\", \"the niagara aquarium\", \"skylon tower observation deck\", and 2 more visits in the visitors center. It will cost only 45$ and",
          "Very underwhelming experience. If it wasn't for being part of a 5 attraction combo ticket through the State park this place would \"dry up\". Sea lion presentation was more like a Greenpeace commercial at beginning. We left part way through the show glanced at fish tanks and",
          "Fun little aquarium. You can see it all in an hour though we arrived in time for 3 events so stayed 1 1/2 hours. We saw the penguin feeding at 10 followed by rescue sea lion talk at 10:30 then sea lion show at 11am. The sea lion show told us the story of how they came to have",
          "Do not waste your money. Not sure I would consider this an aquarium, a few tanks, with some fish. Rude staff. It took us about 10 minutes to see everything . Stay away.",
          "The Aquarium of Niagara is a small aquarium compared to today's larger, more modern aquariums. High school students were not thrilled by this aquarium, especially if they have been to a modern, larger ones. But it is a great place for young family with small children. They",
          "It's a small aquarium but cute. We really enjoyed the outside harbor seals demo and the sea lion show inside was terrific and impressive! That part was worth the visit. I probably wouldn't pay the entry fee but it was part of the Discovery Pass so my 12 year old twin boys",
          "This was a place very educational and enjoyable for ALL ages.Displays of fish penguins and sea lions were easily seen.Play area for the kids as well as inside and outside seating areas. Gift shop with items in all price ranges and the se lion show was one to remember.defintely a",
          "It's a great way to spend an afternoon and boasts a surprising number of species for its size. Expect to see everything in around 1 to 2 hours.",
          "This aquarium of niagara is worth a visit for sea lion show that is held twice or thrice a day. Aquarium is okay..not grt",
          "Good rescue facility and entertaining sea lion show. Also had small animal stage show for extra $4 to do a show and tell about each of 4 animals. Entertaining and educational",
          "It's a very small aquarium , they have a 15 mins show with sea lions that's the best part of the aquarium.",
          "I could not believe the price my family paid to get in and the amount of time we spent in the aquarium. We left within 30 minutes of walking around. The aquarium is very small and not worth the amount they charge per person. I wish we would have had a better experience.",
          "I was very underwhelmed by this experience. We went out of desperation because of a situation out of our control. It is small; the tank at Cabela's is more impressive. We stayed about an hour and that was really pushing it with things to do. If you have $40 to waste and",
          "Not a too Big one. You can cover it in less than an hour. Kids will enjoy it. Dont expect anything new .. just a small aquarium",
          "Where as this was not what I expected coming from Florida...but it was a nice break from the heat. And it isn't too big that little kids loose interest. The BEST thing about the penguins and sea lions are they are all rescues!! That is AMAZING. The frogs and aquariums were",
          "We bought the discovery passes and this aquarium was part of the price, so the price was just right. We were with my dad who was in a wheelchair. We hated walking all away around the back to get into the aquarium. We also couldn't see anything on the second floor as the elevator",
          "This was by far the smallest and least interesting aquarium I have been to, but it was only $3.00 admission The sea lion show was ok. Also, the few displays were nice but it was just so underwhelming . I think children can still enjoy it but I would not have gone if it wasn't",
          "This aquarium was smaller than I thought it would be but was fun and a good activity to get us out of the hot sun. Great sea lion show.",
          "Not really near the ocean, so never expected they'd have California sea lions among other creatures here. There's a big central aquarium inside where they put on a sea lion show. It was just the right length as you stand and watch the show from above (or below through the",
          "What a wonderful place. Totally must see. Buy the discovery passes and you visit 5 attractions inside Niagra state park. Such wonderful people who rescue sea animals. A great place w great shows and great people.",
          "This was nice. Lots of things to see. Very informative. Cute sea lion show. Long walk to it from where the trolley drops you off.",
          "While it certainly can't compare to the Baltimore Aquarium or, other large aquariums, it is fun and great for the kids. They do have a 15 minute sea lion show (as of this review), which was fun. There is a fresh water tank with fish from the region. Mainly salt water tanks,",
          "It was a nice aquarium but very small. I really liked the stuffed sharks all over. Especially liked the sea lions and hearing the stories of how they were saved.",
          "This is a small aquarium, but we had a lot of fun. The sea lion show was fun to watch. We also purchased the package where we could spend one on one time with Sandy the Seal. My entire family enjoyed that a lot!",
          "The sea lion show was excellent and the trainers and animals appeared to have a really good relationship (unlike Sea World). Interesting sea life with interesting information. My kids liked it.",
          "A little off the beaten path - we walked from Maid of the mist. I think the trolley runs here, should have taken it. Not a huge place, penguins, seals, a few exotic fish. A very nice exhibition featuring the seals and their trainers",
          "They are obviously trying to improve. The facility is very old and very few upgrades have been made. Made me very sad to see penguins living like that, but the facts around the enclosure were very interesting. New penguin habitat is coming, but not soon enough \ud83d\ude14",
          "The seas put on a great show. It was also nice to learn about them. The penguins were funny too. This was a great experience.",
          "It was cute. Small. Did have a short sea lion show, although upstairs was a bit hard to see. It was nice. The 3 teenagers had fun. They enjoyed finding Nemo and looking at the fish and turtles and sea lions. It was handicapped accessible for those who need it.",
          "If you have high expectations of this place, don't waste your money unless it is include in your Niagara Falls Discovery Pass. It is a $13 p/p (adults) and $9 p/p (child) for a 1 to 1 1/2 hour visit. The aquarium include penguins, sea lions, seals (outdoor pool), and different",
          "The family we were traveling with wanted to go here so we obliged and wow what a disappointment. This is a very small aquarium with very few animals and not really worth visiting. The only nice thing was the sea lion show, which my 2.5 year old absolutely LOVED. Other than that,",
          "IMPORTANT - DO NOT bother going here unless you have kids under the age 10 or you just need air conditioning. We only went because it was included in our multipass and we had the time. We've been to a variety of aquariums before. This one is average at best. Not much more than",
          "This is a SMALL aquarium. Do not expect Sea World. However, this aquarium is nice, informative and perfect for small children. There's a lot to do in Niagara, however there's a lot that small children don't enjoy quite as much. This is their place! It's big enough that they feel",
          "It has one good show that dose not need money. The other shows cost money and the meet the seals is way over priced $55 for one person to get close to a seal. Also, it is very small, could see the whole thing in about an hour.",
          "At 13 Dollars per adult it is a very small aquarium. It is essentially one large circular viewing room surrounding a sea lion tank, with smaller exhibits along the outer walls. There is a sea lion show several times a day. This show is actually quite entertaining and almost",
          "I have been to Niagara Falls many times but this was my first visit to the Aquarium. I was there with my husband and teenage daughters. We had such a good time. I was concerned that the girls would be too old to enjoy the aquarium but they loved it. They were delighted by the",
          "Not sure I'd ever go back here. It's kind of a long walk & it's not that great. I would stick to the main attractions. We bought the Discovery pass that included tickets to this but it was pretty disappointing. We won't go back.",
          "We surprised my daughter with a trip to the aquarium because she is a penguin lover! We got there when it opened and our timing was perfect. We got to see the seals being fed, hear a talk on the penguins and watch the show all in about an hour and a half. It's not a big aquarium",
          "This is a small aquarium, the coast was $13.00 per person which was a little high considering they only had a few penguins and a few seals.....",
          "The aquarium was on the small side. But it was really nice to see. There was amazing stories about the seals. And the sea lions were outstanding. I could have watched that show over and over.",
          "We got the pass to do the whole experience at the falls. The aquarium is part of it. It was fun but I definitely wouldn't pay to go again. Not too much to see. The sea lion feeding was cool though.",
          "The title say it all - the Aquarium of Niagara is \"OK\". It is actually a pretty nice, little aquarium. The exhibits are well presented and maintained, with a decent representation of life in the waters around the world and local to Niagara. There are also penguins, sharks,",
          "This was a small aquarium. We weren't too impressed with it. We didn't dislike it but we didn't love it either.",
          "This is probably fun for younger kids on a rainy day. But if you have been to other aquariums this one is pale by comparison. The two seals in the center tank were the main attraction and after two minutes your ready for something else. They did have some interesting fish and",
          "First, our group purchased the Discovery Pass. Well worth it. $45 for tickets to Maid of the Mist, Cave of the Winds, Niagara Gorge Discovery Center, Niagara Adventure Theater, and the Aquarium of Niagara. You also get a one day pass for the trolley and a bunch of coupons! This",
          "This is probably best geared to families with young children, or those who have never been to an aquarium. If you have been to any other aquarium, this will feel small by comparison",
          "It was an average aquarium for the price. 3 or 4 exhibits were under construction, which for this size aquarium is quite a lot. I know it's for improvement and making the aquarium better, but we did breeze through it. Overall it wasn't bad, we spent about an hour and a half",
          "It was very small and really, not work the price. There isn't much to see and we went thru the place pretty quickly. Was a bit disappointing.",
          "It was raining so we stopped in here. Small and many of the exhibits were under construction. Considering the price I was surprised they didn't give some warning of that. Sea lion show was fun but the tank was small and you could only see the trainer from a few spots. Not ideal",
          "This was in the Discovery pass 5 Attractions at 1 price. Maid of the Mist, Cave of the Winds, Niagara Adventure Theater, Niagara Gorge Discovery Center, Niagara Aquarium. I love aquariums and this was by far the smallest one I've every visited. I'm glad it was included in the",
          "Lots of sea life to see....Sharks, piranhas, sea lions, but the star of the aquarium is \u201cSpirit of the Sea\u201d sea lion show. The trainers made the showvery interesting and fun.",
          "Great for a cloudy, cool, or rainy day. The seal presentation was very well done and informative. Great for little kids too. Took a little more than an hour to do. More, if you have kids, as there are some hands-on things for them. Small, but a nice stop.",
          "Enjoyed a 1.5 hour visit. They need to announce over a PA system when they will be putting on shows. We wanted to see one, but there was no announcement, we got there one minute after it was supposed to start and it was almost over. They must have started several minutes early.",
          "Very small aquarium but the exhibits were nicely cared for and some of the fish were interesting. Make sure to try to catch the sea lion show--it was amazing and the kids loved it. Take the trolley! It looked like a fairly short walk on the street using our tourist map, but it",
          "The only reason we went was because it came with our adventure pass. If it wasn't included we would not have gone. Small and have seen everything in a zoo before!",
          "The Aquarium is very small, don't think this is similar to a big city Aquarium or Zoo. I would suggest checking the event schedule to see when you should visit. We walked the whole thing in under 30 minutes. The have special shows, feedings and meeting at certain times. I would",
          "This came with the discovery pass and probably would not have gone but it came with so we went (to get our monies worth) and we were pleasantly surprised. The best part of the aquarium was the sea lion show, which was excellent, informational, and very entertaining. If you go",
          "My two teens really enjoyed the brand new sea lion show with 4 sea lions. We also got to speak with the trainer and ask about training for animals. He was very patient and kind. We noticed that the whole place is being updated and were glad to see that. It's a smaller aquarium,"

        "wiki": "Sahlen Field (previously named Pilot Field, Downtown Ballpark, North AmeriCare Park, Dunn Tire Park and Coca-Cola Field) is a baseball park in Buffalo, New York. Home to the Buffalo Bisons since 1988, the venue is the highest-capacity Triple-A baseball stadium in the United States.Due to travel restrictions brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Toronto Blue Jays (Bisons' MLB affiliate) have considered playing their home games at the venue during the 2020 season. It would the first time Major League Baseball has been played in Buffalo since the original Buffalo Bisons played from 1879-1885 as part of the National League.\nThe venue has hosted the National Buffalo Wing Festival since 2002.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pilot Field (1988\u20131995) ===\n\nSt. John's Episcopal Church originally occupied the site's land at the corner of Swan and Washington. Constructed between 1846 and 1848 on land donated by Joseph Ellicott, the church remained in use until 1893 and was demolished in 1906.\nIt then became the site of Ellsworth Statler's first hotel, Statler Hotel, in 1907. It was later renamed Hotel Buffalo after Statler built a new Statler Hotel on Niagara Square in 1923 and sold his former location. The hotel was demolished in 1968, leaving the site empty until the stadium was built in 1988.\nFormer Mayor of Buffalo James D. Griffin was instrumental in bringing professional baseball and Pilot Field to Buffalo. Griffin and a group of investors purchased the Jersey City A's for $55,000 in 1978 and relocated the team to War Memorial Stadium, where they began play as the Buffalo Bisons in 1979. Griffin spearheaded construction and development of Pilot Field, and he threw the ceremonial first pitch at the park's inaugural Opening Day in 1988. A statue of Griffin throwing this pitch is located outside the stadium, and the address of the venue was renamed to One James D. Griffin Plaza in his honor.HOK Sport (now known as Populous) designed Pilot Field as one of the first retro-classic ballparks. This concept featured classic and distinctive architecture, a grass field, baseball-specific design, and a location within the downtown core. The same firm would bring this concept to the major leagues four years later with Oriole Park at Camden Yards.At the time of the stadium's construction, Buffalo was hoping to obtain either an expansion Major League Baseball team or a relocated team; Buffalo was one of the five finalists in the early 1990s National League expansion process, which led to the 1993 debuts of the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins. The ballpark was originally built with a seating capacity of 19,500 people, which at the time made it the third-largest stadium in minor league baseball. The overall design allows for future expansion to accommodate a major league team, as capacity could be increased to nearly 40,000 by double-decking the existing mezzanine.In their first year at the venue after moving from War Memorial Stadium, the Buffalo Bisons broke the all-time record for minor league attendance by drawing 1,186,651 fans during the 1988 season.The venue was host to the inaugural Triple-A All-Star Game in July 1988.Goo Goo Dolls filmed the music video for their debut single \"There You Are\" at the venue in 1990.The June 3, 1990 game between the Buffalo Bisons and Oklahoma City 89ers with a post-show concert by The Beach Boys set the all-time single-game attendance record for baseball at the venue with 21,050 fans. The Bisons lost the game 7\u20136.In their fourth year at the venue, the Buffalo Bisons once again broke the all-time record for minor league attendance by drawing 1,240,951 fans during the 1991 season.Jim Kelly held his annual charity event StarGaze at the venue in 1992 and 1993.The baseball portion of the 1993 Summer Universiade was held at the venue.\n\n\n=== North AmeriCare Park (1995\u20131998) ===\nPilot Air Freight of Philadelphia had their name stripped from the venue by the City of Buffalo in March 1995. They had agreed to pay the city $51,000 every year for 20 years, but they defaulted on the payments. The stadium was then known as Downtown Ballpark until July 1995, when local HMO North AmeriCare purchased the naming rights and the stadium became North AmeriCare Park.The third-annual WEDG Edgefest music festival took place at the venue in June 1997 and included performances by Buck-O-Nine, David Usher, Goo Goo Dolls, Moist, Saturn Battery, Sloan, Tugboat Annie and Weezer.The venue was home to the Buffalo Nighthawks of the short-lived Ladies Professional Baseball League in 1998.\n\n\n=== Dunn Tire Park (1999\u20132008) ===\n \nA local chain of retail tire outlets purchased the 10-year naming rights to the stadium in May 1999, and it became Dunn Tire Park. \nWKSE staged their tenth-annual Kiss the Summer Hello music festival at the venue in May 2001, and it included performances by 3LW, 98 Degrees, Dream, Ja Rule, Jagged Edge, No Authority, Samantha Mumba, Seven Day Faith and The Go-Go's.The first-annual WYRK Taste of Country music festival took place at the venue in June 2001 and included performances by Clay Davidson, Joe Diffie, Kristin Garner, Neal McCoy, Tammy Cochran and Travis Tritt.WKSE staged their eleventh-annual Kiss the Summer Hello music festival at the venue in May 2002, and it included performances by Ashanti, Michelle Branch, O-Town, Seven Day Faith, Shaggy, Tone Loc and Vanessa Carlton.The second-annual WYRK Taste of Country music festival took place at the venue in June 2002 and included performances by Brad Paisley, Cyndi Thomson, Emerson Drive, Lonestar and Ty Herndon.An August 30, 2002 game between the Buffalo Bisons and Rochester Red Wings matched the all-time single-game attendance record for baseball at the venue with 21,050 fans.

The screen is the largest in all of Minor League Baseball. That same year, a new $970,000 lighting system was added to the venue.For the 2014 season, $500,000 was spent in improvements to the venue, including a new sound system and the installation of new LED message boards down both baselines.In order to modernize the stadium, the venue began a campaign to replace older seating with wider seats in 2014. 3,700 seats were replaced prior to the 2015 season, reducing capacity of the stadium from 18,025 to 17,600. More seats were replaced prior to the 2017 season, reducing capacity of the stadium from 17,600 to 16,907. Additional seats were replaced prior to the 2019 season, further reducing capacity to 16,600.\n\n\n== Accessibility and transportation ==\nSahlen Field is served by the Seneca Station on the Buffalo Metro Rail.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWar Memorial Stadium (Buffalo, New York)\nOffermann Stadium\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSahlen Field\nBall Parks of the Minor Leagues - Coca-Cola Field\nDigital Ballparks - Sahlen Field\nRochester Area Ballparks \u2013 Coca-Cola Field",

          "It's a huge big stadium i love it",
          "Fantastic venue, friendly staff - an enjoyable night!",
          "Ball park is fantastic, but the food service is the slowest of any ball park I've ever been to. Staff seem disinterested and incapable of moving beyond a snail's pace.",
          "Great experience save the hot dog and lack of fries unless I wanted to wait 30 min, better planning needed for big events",
          "Good value, aged and oversized structure.",
          "I love the events that they put on here, it\u2019s really great. I wish they still did bases-merloted. I went there once ON my birthday, super fun! Their Independence Day fireworks are always amazing, unfortunately I missed it this year! I love how they give out free tickets sometimes at the Buffalo Auto Show, great marketing for sure!",
          "Always great fun at a great park.  Seats just above the dugout for $15..and the Pawsox won (thank you says this Boston guy). The 6:05 start time was perfect for a Saturday night...It left us time for an ice cream cone before we got home.",

          "Fan appreciation night. The Bison's were over the top with the giveaways! Always a fun time. Thanks for a great season!",

          "One 6 or 8 foot opening for exiting 15 or 16 thousand people when at capacity during special events is absolutely not adequate",

          "I love it here,  always a good time",

          "Very slow service at the Concession Stands regularly.  Was there for the last day of the season on Monday, August 27, 2018 and they had Popcorn for a $1.00 and Ice Cream $1.00.  I went for the Popcorn, wasn't offered Butter, so I asked and \u2026",
          "It's a bit beat up, but a great place to see a game. $1 ice creams tonight (Monday). Buster is great for the kids. A jewel in the summer nights, when trying to escape the hot city life. Bison baseball always a winner",

Pre game party was told to me to be pretty good. We did not make that in time. Overall a great night out with the family.",

          "Great ballpark to visit.  Well maintained field and plenty of great sight lines. Has a small museum and shops that sell Bisons attire.   The restaurant that's in the stadium served great food.  The buffet was amazing value with good food.  A shame that it is open only when the Bisons are in town.",

          "It's a good time for a family and/or friends sports outing. The food and beer isn't too expensive (relatively speaking), the tickets are cheap, and it's always a good time watching the games and fun things that go on between innings.",
          "My husband and I went to see a Bisons game for a date for our Anniversary. The stadium is really nice and the facilities are clean and well kept. The only negative was the seagulls. They slightly overtook right field and they did fly into the stands to eat food left behind. We",
          "Great place to take your kids for a baseball game..or just adults..at about 15.00 per ticket..you cant go wrong!",
          "Love going here. They are very friendly and always welcoming to my group from work. We also are allowed to bring in our lunch if we choose, which is a big draw as some of the individuals we work with do not have the money to spend on the food. The stadium is nice and have never",

          "We attended a game last week on a perfect night for baseball. It was sunny skies and just the right temperature. We attended an event in a large suite. The food was simple - cheese and crackers, fruit plate, pizza and wings. It was all well presented and large portions. The",
          "I went last year to the Star Wars night, and it was amazing! Many gift shops and food stands with a must-try chilly cheese hotdog! I would highly recommend going on Star Wars night, it's great for kids and adults. The regular games are great too, but not as fun. ( don't forget",

          "A sunny day or a cool evening doesn't matter, go see the Bisons play baseball in the downtown Coca Cola Field ball park. The river is just off to your right. The Ball Park has an old fashion feel to it but its not old at all. The food is good and the stand vendors are lots of",
          "Have been to this ballpark many times. Right in downtown, easy access from anywhere in the area. Prices are good. Try the Beef on Weck and get the salt potatoes. I always try to find local fare at the ballparks, gives you a nice feel for the area. Buy beer from Conehead in",
          "Nice location and atmosphere in the downtown area. The park is really big but all seats are good. Food was good and reasonably priced. Have the Beef on Wek. Park is older type of park. Can only see game from the seats. Definately a good venue if you like baseball",

          "This is a nice minor league ball park. It was a day for Dog's in the park, which was fun. The park didn't seem to have a bad seat. We walked all around it was clean, a variety of food, even for those wanting something on the lighter side. If the team is in town when you are",
          "If you are only planning 1 visit to see the Bisons in 2015 make it on Star Wars night (Sat July 18 2015) This is a great event for kids and Star Wars fans! The park is decorated and most fans dress up in costume or their favorite Star Wars tshirts. Last year each family received",
          "My wife & I make an annual trip to Buffalo for a weekend of Bisons games. Great little park to watch a game. Lots of great seats usually available and the park staff are always very helpful & friendly - special kudos to the staff at the concession stand in the upper level -",
          "Coca Cola Field is a throw back to the old style stadium. Compact, well kept and great fans - not many but those who come out enjoy the game and the fans that do show up. Everyone was welcoming and very respectful. The food was standard for Ball Parks but then again we came to",

          "We came here for the National Buffalo Wing Festival. We only were able to see the downtown area and I just hope the rest of Buffalo doesn't look the same. The stadium was nice enough, but the city was a little dingy. No reason for me to go back.",
          "been here since the very first opening, and while there had been a bit of a slump in enthusiasm, \"The Coke\" (its fourth name, we believe) has refound its mojo, largely due to an enthusiastic, energectic young team of programmers... new seats accommodate those who have",
          "We went during the Blue Jays Bison's affiliate day. Fred McGriff & Kelly Gruber were at the ball park. We sat about 3 rows behind home plate. The tickets were cheap compare to an MLB Game. Tons of give aways during the game. The food was great. They except the Canadian dollar",
          "I loved my trip to the field. We watch an exciting game, and I had to have a Hot Dog! They throw shirts into the bleachers. The restaurant has many great dishes, and not just for wackey adults, but for excited kids too! You will enjoy a day at the field.",
          "Every year my family visits the ballpark several times each summer. The games are always fun to attend and the prices of the tickets and the food is very reasonable. For the last two years we attend the country music concerts, not the best place to see and view a concert but the",
          "Catching a baseball game on a beautiful summer night is one of the best things to do in Buffalo. The Bisons go all out to make sure that the venue is family friendly. Even if you are not into baseball, you can enjoy special events, food, being outside for the evening! The",
          "A great place to spend a summer evening watching the future stars of MLB at a family friendly and affordable venue. The ballpark upgraded to video board with one of the biggest HD screens in all of the minor leagues.",
          "Where else can you sit behind home plate for $12, watch guys who will be playing for the Jays next week, and be treated like family. The Bisons are a well-run business: the concession stands are low-cost and offer lots of variety; including decent craft beer at reasonable prices",
          "This place is great. It was built in the mode of the classic stadiums of the golden era of baseball. It was an inspiration to Camden Yards and all of the newer major league stadiums. The Buffalo Bisons offer an incredible value. Great product on the field, plenty of 'gimmicks'",
          "I visited Coca-Cola Field to watch a Buffalo Bison game. This was my first time at a AAA baseball game. I may have enjoyed the game, the stadium, and the atmosphere more than a major league game. The stadium was very well kept and very accommodating to fans. After the game",
          "I come here to the Coca-Cola Field a few times a year with different people every time and it's a pretty nice baseball park. Different food stands to choose from, and clean for the most part. I would recommend for much of anyone of any age to come here.",

          "What a great ballpark, right in downtown Buffalo. Lots of places in and around the ballpark to park, eat and drink. No better place on a warm summer afternoon or evening. And don't forget the annual Wing Festival held here each year!",
          "I went to the last game of the season. Nice AAA baseball park. Prices for food and beverages are reasonable. Only complaint is there was a long wait to get tix at the window, but it was about sold out.",
          "I went to a ballgame during the friday night bash. These include fireworks after the game. I was in a suite with a company and it was nice and clean and great views. Tickets are affordable and I highly recommend this for families.",
          "Ballparks are fun! It was a bobblehead giveaway night and what could be more appropriate for Buffalo than a chicken wing bobblehead giveaway! Chicken Wing, a mascot was also on hand to great everyone. Food choices were great - fried balogna and beef on weck!",
          "Perfect as always. Fireworks were amazing. Park was clean and affordable. We always enjoy trips to the ballpark.",
          "I took in a game at the end of the season and was delighted by the experience. A great place for baseball fans and especially for Blue Jays fans. The fans were friendly and clearly there for the love of the game and the family experience. The sunset was an added treat. What a",

          "When this place was constructed, 20 some years ago, they had Major League Baseball in mind. That never happened, but this magnificent retro-ballpark remains a gem in downtown Buffalo. If you're in the area and have a love for the game, stop by.",

          "This was our first baseball experience outside Toronto's huge, domed Rogers Centre, and we loved it! You can see the game and the players up close for about the price of a movie. Great beer options, decent if limited food choices. The restaurant is affordable too--try the pulled",
          "Being from Austin, TX, we were THRILLED to be in Buffalo with WONDERFUL weather and temps in the 70's in AUGUST!! What could top that off? BASEBALL in August without the 106 degrees at home. This stadium is clean, well laid out, great views from any location, and a fun night",
          "Not a bad seat in the house, and the tickets are very affordable. Be sure to check for specials, and give always before deciding on a game to watch.",
          "There's no better baseball experience than at a minor league game. The stadiums are intimate, all seats are close to the field, ticket prices dirt cheap and players giving it all so they can get a shot at playing in the big leagues, Coca-Cola field has a dated feel",
          "We love minor league ball and minor league stadiums. Buffalo wanted to make a push to land a major league club so they built this stadium big. The problem now is that its minor league ball so the place always looks empty. The stadium was built in the mid 80s I believe so it",
          "Great time watching the Bisons play some AAA ball! Tickets are cheap ($13) and seem to be easily available at the box office on game day. Fried bologna was great! Go to the craft beer corner - I had a watermelon wheat beer which was surprisingly good. Very family friendly. Just",
          "After seeing this from the I-190 whenever we've crossed the border, we finally got to not just one game but TWO. First time was late April 2014 when the temperature plummeted. We brought a blanket and fairly heavy coats but we still froze along with other hardy fans. Nice people",
          "Coca cola field was my eighth minor league park visited and least memorable. If your in buffalo and a sports fan by all means go, tickets range from 7 to 15 bucks sight lines are good considering its the largest park in minors and scoreboard is second to none. Food was average",
          "If you have not experienced AAA baseball here, this is a must on your list while in Buffalo. This is one of the best minor league stadiums in the USA. Every seat is a great seat and they are comfortable. The stadium has a great variety of tasteful food and drinks. Plenty of",

          "AAA baseball offers good baseball for a fraction of major league prices. Coca Cola Field is one of the best minor league stadiums there is. Now that the Bisons are the Blue Jays AAA farm team, it is terrific to see up and coming Blue Jays and Blue Jays on rehab and they are only",
          "We picked the wrong night to go to the ball game. It was Star Wars night and no one around us was there to watch the game. We couldn't even see the game because people were constantly getting up to go get something to eat and drink. Also I found that we were getting kicked",
          "This is a really nice ball park. I took my daughter and two grandsons to a game. We had a really good time. The food is ball park quality - nothing special and the lines for the concession stands can be long. The weather was great and on Fridays they have fireworks. It is an",

          "Great ballpark, great baseball. Food choices were OK but don't compare to some other AAA ballparks (Rochester is outstanding). The game was fun and exciting, and the seats put fans close to the action. For this attraction (and for anything in Buffalo) - some decent signage on",

          "My husband and I found the history of the carousel fascinating - the kids, not so much. We learned a lot about the history of the carousel - so much we didn't know. The kids liked the carousel ride, but then spent a lot of time in the kids area - there were tons of fun",

          "The museum is small but very informative. We enjoyed riding the carousel and feeling like a child again. They also have a carousel and other activities in Kiddy Land. This would be a nice stop for families. It was worth going a little out of our way to see it.",

          "We stopped here with a large group of people as part of a tour, and the staff was very accommodating to us. We learned about carving, the Wurlitzer music machines, and got to ride the historic carrousel. Everyone that rode the carrousel had a huge smile on their face, which",
          "We've visited twice before, and both times enjoyed it. However, this time was a totally different experience. The staff/volunteers were rude and cold, and seemed bothered that we were even there. Answering questions appeared to be a chore, and we were so turned off by the",
          "What a wonderful little museum--the history of the company was amazingly interesting as was the workmanship that the craftsman performed carving the horses by hand. The Carousel ride was special seeing it was 1st one made at the factory--FUN!",
          "The exterior gives you an awesome sense of arrival! Well done. We were there today and they don't have the outside rides and exhibits open, so our entire adventure lasted less than 45 minutes, including the very pleasant carousel ride on their indoor carousel was disappointed",
          "The carrousel museum is out of the way, and in the middle of a neighborhood which makes it seem as if you are in the wrong place. It's small, maybe an hour visit tops, but both my kids and my husband loved it. The history of how they create the carrousel figures and the music",

          "My husband liked the workshop and the grandchildren enjoyed the rides. Some rides I haven't seen in ages so it was a nice trip down memory lane. The kiddies especially liked the little boats with \"real water.\" The ride operators were friendly and made the whole experience much",
          "So many choices to eat at but we ended up here while visiting the Reading market. It's a good thing I bumped into this lady while walking around to find the best food around. It's no joke! The pastrami was bursting with flavor. This is now our fav place for pastrami. No need to",
          "We stopped into the Carrousel museum to ride the old carrousel with a Wurlitzer organ - both of us grew up with visits to beach towns on the east coast with old fashioned carrousels. The 6 dollar entry fee includes 1 free ride on the carrousel, with each additional ride 50",

          "Really enjoyed this stop on our Niagara Falls trip! The kids were able to ride carousels as well as other rides. Lots of information about the carousels and their history, as well as the opportunity to watch carvers at work. The kids' activity room was a nice bonus too.",

          "We enjoyed a nice visit to this little gem. Tour the small old factory, see a variety of horses, and ride an original. Nice little room with games for the kids too. The staff were so nice and helpful. It's only an hour or two visit but we were glad for the unique experience.",
          "This a very nice little museum having to do with the making of carrousels. It's especially nice when there are woodcarvers to watch. Of course,the best part is riding the old fashion carrousel. They are adding kiddie rides I remember from The Whistle Pig restaurant.",

          "This museum is small, but packed with a lot of interesting carousel history and examples of long-forgotten craftsmanship, as well as an opportunity for a long ride on a magical old merry-go-round. It was a surprise to find such an interesting place hidden away from the usual",

          "Great place to walk all seasons Very quiet and scenic paths through woods and field as well as pavement",
          "It was a warm sunny day and we spent 3 hours at the dog park and walking trails. The 2 dog park areas are huge and let the dogs run and run and provide water spigots and a hose to wash down.",
          "I live near Knox Farm and love to run in their beautifully maintained trails system. It is easy to get lost in there if you are directionally challenged as I am but it\u2019s surprising how many trails there really are tucked away in those woods. The only downside is that horses also",
          "Bring the kids, dogs, in-laws or anyone who enjoys the great outdoors! Knox has a variety of outdoor trails, vistas and even a dog park. It is a beautiful and scenic spot with lots of room and plenty of views.",
          "This lovely park is a great spot for a run, with ample parking available. There are a variety of paved, gravel, and dirt trails without any large hills. Everything is well marked. The park is dog friendly (use a leash) and there is a fenced dog park as well.",
          "Today, I hiked 2.6 miles at Knox Farm State Park. Many of the trails are paved, some are dirt or mud depending on the season. The views are very nice and green in the Spring. I imagine that the Fall colors are outstanding. There are equestrian trails and an off leash dog",
          "Beautiful farmland turned into park. Nice dog park, whether you want to bring your own or just watch them play. Nice trails to walk on, or ride on your horse. Very scenic, and perfect for a photo shoot.",
          "Just finished up a trip to the 2018 Holiday Arts & Crafts Show at Knox - our first time for the event as well as Knox Farm. Although it was a wet and cold day it was still a fun time and definitely starts your mind thinking about the upcoming holidays! School busses will",
          "Great place for families, friends and pets. They also have special events that occur throughout the year. Well kept, clean and beautiful.",
          "The dog part looked wonderful and the grounds were gorgeous if you\u2019re looking for a wedding venue but as walkers We felt like we must be missing something, the trail seemed very short",
          "I wondered what this place was like so when a friend suggested we go today, I agreed. We could not find the Visitors Center. We asked a few people and they did not seem to know. So, we set out on our own without a trail map. My friend had been before and thought she",
          "I often run at knox park, great trails through the woods, and you may even pass a horse!! there is also a dog park here to bring your furry friend :)",
          "Wow! The place was mobbed. The turnout was more than they expedited and the closed the main gate shortly after we got there. The Mansion is worth seeing all by itself. The vendors inculded everything from foods, jewelry, knitting, Christmas and great Christmas gifts. We enjoyed"

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Eternal Flame Falls is a small waterfall located in the Shale Creek Preserve, a section of Chestnut Ridge Park in Western New York. A small grotto at the waterfall's base emits natural gas, which can be lit to produce a small flame. This flame is visible nearly year round, although it can be extinguished and must occasionally be re-lit.\nThe Eternal Flame Falls were featured in the book Secret Places by Bruce Kershner and in the book What's Weird on Earth.\n\n\n== Recent developments ==\nOnce considered an \"obscure\" attraction in the region, media attention and improvements to the access trail have led to an increased number of visitors. The increased popularity of the falls has led to some negative impacts, such as an increase in litter, vandalism, pollution, and impacts on the surrounding terrain by tourists, but also fueled a successful public protest against a plan to clear a nearby forested area to install a disc golf course in 2012.  But the disc golf course was installed just through the forest area.\n\n\n== Composition and source of gas ==\nGeologists from Indiana University Bloomington and Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology studied Eternal Flame Falls in 2013 in an effort to better understand how natural gas emitted from naturally occurring hydrocarbon seeps contribute to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They found that the 'macro seep' at Eternal Flame Falls had higher concentrations of ethane and propane (about 35%) than other known natural gas seeps, which typically contain a greater proportion of methane. They estimated that the seep at the falls emits approximately one kilogram (2.2 lb) of methane per day.The researchers also noted the presence of numerous other 'micro seeps' in the area of the falls. By comparing the gas emitted by these seeps with gas from wells in the area, they determined that the gasses originate from Rhinestreet Shale approximately 400 meters (1,300 ft) below the surface. Tectonic activity likely opened faults in the shale, allowing the gas to reach the surface.According to one geologist involved in the 2013 study, the seep's apparent source could provide evidence for a previously unknown geologic mechanism by which natural gas is produced within shale. Typically, shale must be hot (around 100 \u00b0C [212 \u00b0F]) for its carbon structures to break down and form smaller natural gas molecules. However, the shale from which Eternal Flame Falls draws its gas is much cooler, in addition to being younger and shallower than typical gas-bearing shale. This may indicate that additional, as yet undemonstrated, processes can contribute to the creation of natural gas in shale; one possibility is that a catalyst capable of breaking down shale in cooler conditions is present.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNaturally fueled eternal flames\nList of waterfalls of New York\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of Eternal Flame Falls trail",

          "Beautiful park and great setting.  The flame trail was nice, decent elevation change and some slippery water/flatrock spot so be prepared.\nThe surround park and adjacent trails are pretty extensive, so you can make a full 8 hour day of this park.  Fairly challenging.  Bring water, snacks, bug/tick spray.",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit! A must when you're in the Buffalo area.\nIt's a hike though so be prepared. Steep hill down into a ravine and then you're walking up the stream. Then back up that steep hill. Wear the proper shoes and watch \u2026",
          "Nice, majestic, easy trail down a creek to get to the eternal flame. It's in the woods, so there's plenty of trees to block the hot sun (if going on super sunny day). Very relaxing & fun. Great for some nature pics as well!",
          "A nice hike, good workout on the way back up.  Don't go after a lot of rain unless you plan to get very wet, the trail follows the stream for about 40% of the way and could get very slippery.\n\nNot life-changing but kinda cool, bring a long lighter, you may need to reach in and relight.",
          "Well marked path.  Could be a bit of a challenge for some (i.e.: those with limited mobility etc).  Enjoyable walk down into the creek bed. The flame is not that big, but still pretty cool.  Worth checking out.\n\nP.S. Port-o-potty at the entrance was disgusting (insidd) and well over due for some cleaning.",
          "Love going here its an easy hike. The flame was not on lol buuut usually it is. It did start pouring rain when we went which was awesome we loved every minute of it!",
          "Very cool. Easy to find, easy half mile hike. Bit of a hill and more enjoyable to creek-walk the last bit but you can stay dry if you wish. A bit crowded but definitely worth the trip.",
          "There was a small hike (15-20 minutes) to get to the eternal flame but it was very fun! The view of the falls with the flame in the back is amazing. Perfect place to hike with family or friends. You are able to bring your dog as well.",
          "Always a beautiful place to go with the family, we've been coming for years and we have a blast every time. It's about an hour in a half hike and it's fun.",
          "Went with my 5yo, and it was a pleasant easy one-hour hike. A great destination for those who would like a short walk in the nature",

          "Went there when there was still snow on the ground and it had melted and turned icy. It was a difficult hike in tennis shoes but the view was definitely worth it. Wear good hiking boots and don't be afraid to get muddy!",
          "It's a great way to get outside to take a walk in nature, no matter what time of year. You get a good work out, make sure you wear, water proof foot wear, with good treades, it's a pretty good walk going down & up the hills",
          "The trail that lead to the ravine was very clean and easy to walk. The ravine leading to the flame was awesome - very pretty with sunbeams coming through.  It was late in the rain season when we went so we could walk directly in on the creek bed. Loved it and you will too.",
          "Path was a lot of fun, it goes right up to the falls through the creek. The walk takes a bit of balance if you don't want to step in the water, so bring big boots. I got lucky and went during a thaw, so there was a lot of water.",
          "Great hiking, and the falls with the eternal flame was such a bonus once you arrived.",

          "It's a very great place to hike. Saw lot of families and kids, so don't hesitate in bringing yours. It's about 0.53 miles long on one side with steep elevation at some points. \n\nJust some additional info for called freak, you'll burn between 400-550 calories depending on your weight.",
          "My absolute favorite hike in the area. Not too long or difficult, but it gets dicey when there's been a good rain recently. Don't forget a long lighter in case the flame is out.",

          "Beautiful  nice little hike!",
          "Such a beautiful place. So many hiking trails and other amazing sights to see. Just bring bug spray and as much water as you can. The terrain has been washed pretty good so the roots and other rocks are all coming up and out so they may fall. Other than these just be careful",
          "Fun side trip, nice hike on a well worn trail.. people laugh cause it's suggested you bring a barbecue lighter in case the flame is out.. \"how eternal can it be?\".. should it be called eternal gas leak? \ud83d\ude42 was lit in our case and quite an unusual sight.",

          "Perfect for hiking and Creek walking",
          "Wonderful 1.5 mile hike to the falls and back, will take about 1 hour or so. The terrian gets muddy and difficult to cross. Make sure your shoes are waterproof! You can easily turn this to a 8 mile plus hike if you take other trails that offshoot from the main trail.",
          "Beautiful trail, easy, in the shade and has calm energy Vibe. 912 meters each way, at the bottom of the canyon rocks are slippery and wet. Burning flames are unique and best observed during sunset",

          "The hike is roughly a mile long with easy to follow trail markers. You have to go back the same way you came. Half of the trail involves walking through a ravine with some water trickling over the pathway (can be slippery). On the off \u2026",
          "visited mid October 2019, there were 2 flames in the small grotto with a small set of falls. with the leaves changing was really spectacular. well worth visiting. gave 4 stars as for people with walking disabilities may not be able to handle the walk. some step sections as well as a few difficult areas walking amongst tree debrise.",

          "Well kept trails, easy hike, lowly populated, and really cool rewards at the end!",
          "Mild to moderate walk. Someone with weak knees might want to think twice. Nice to spend a couple hours walking in nature amongst other hikers and their dogs. If you stay on the trail there no problems besides the decline and incline back up. Wear boots or shoes you don't mind getting muddy or wet.",
          "This used to be the best place to take your dog until everyone found out about it. Super crowded",
          "ita a hike to see something unusual and strange ..visit in dead of winter you will understand",
          "The trail is quite steep at some points, the hike is a bit dofficult at some points. It's sometimes slippery so wear shoes with good traction. The flame is very amazing though. When you get to the flame it's a nice open area. The hike back \u2026",

          "I think it was a fall and a flame.",

          "Amazing location that will test your skills to get to.  This is not a typical tourist location and if you expect to push a stroller to this while wearing your flipflops you'll be significantly challenged.  But if you don't mind a short hike \u2026",
          "Nice little hiking trails with a unique little natural phenomenon! Was very enjoyable even with not much water flow. Although I feel like a lot of water would've taken away from the flame.",
          "We were here during a dry spell so the falls were dry.  But we were able to get a nice close up view of the flame, which was super neat.  The hike to get there was awesome!  There was a nice path through the trees with natural stairs made \u2026",
          "So much to see. Average level of hiking. Be careful with young kids when the water is high.",
          "Bring your own way to light the flame!!",
          "Nice Experience. Good walking Trail",
          "Nice place to hike and really cool destination seeing the flame behind the waterfall",
          "Nice walk in a park, about a 3/4 mile to the fall. Bring your lighter, the flame might be off. Also, the fall itself might be so small that it goes besides the flame and not on top of it.",
          "Absolutely worth the hike!!!! Dog friendly too",
          "Enjoyed this hike a lot \ud83d\ude0a very unique!",
          "One of a kind. It's a short hike into the forest before you get to the falls but it's worth a detour",
          "Best place for hiking",
          "Nice quick hike. There is a short distance where have to hike through the stream, water shoes recommended. Was dry day we hiked it,not much rain. Hike is fairly easy, but can be slippery when at bottom of gorge.",
          "Nice trail, however flame was out. We're basing that on the weather; still snow and icy waters",
          "Def moderate in difficulty.  Short steep climb, and some Billy goat traversing of large logjam.  But worth the work.",
          "My favorite place to hike, I really enjoy Chesnut Ridge. So much to see, so many trails to discover. Not too rough for my children. My 3 year old always asks me if we can go hiking, and this is the place she speaks of. Lots of fun, well shaded by the tall trees so when it rains you're barely affected it's nature's umbrella.",
          "Hands down, Chestnut Ridge is my favorite local park, and this trail is a staple.  I used to go to the flame back when there was no official trail and you just had to know where to park and go- but now this makes the Eternal Flame \u2026",
          "Very slick... only for experienced hikers",
          "Beautiful experience! Worth the walk! Bring boots for walking along the creek. Easy to moderate difficulty, a few people brought children as well as a few seniors. Go to the bathroom first, there aren't any restrooms in the parking area or anywhere else. You will want pictures.",
          "Superb place for a good quality family time or with friends!\nThe trail is very well marked with arrows & signages and also warning boards.\nIts a great trail for begeners! It is not too difficult and at the sametime not too easy too. \u2026",
          "The flame with the falls was elemental and generally magical. Short hike, though with some potentially challenging terrain. Nice to dip my feet in cool water on a hot day.",
          "Nature is awesome, unique place in the world highly recommend the hike.",
          "Fun trail with pretty views... A little over a mile. Definitely need good shoes bc it gets muddy in spots and you need good traction",
          "Worth the trek! Be advised that the time of year you decide to do this hike will determine the feasibility of the trail. We went during a dry spell. If it os a wet time of year you will definitely encounter some running water and lots of \u2026",
          "Wow....where did this place come from?  Another hidden gem.",
          "They have done a poor job maintaining these trails. Fallen trees blocked the path just before getting to the flame.",
          "Amazing short and beautiful hike. We keep coming back it's our favorite.",
          "Perfect hike. Not too long. Plenty of beautiful sights. Very natural.",
          "Great hike! Kid & dog friendly!",
          "A beautiful hike through the woods. If you go in Spring, expect it to be wet and wear shoes or sandals that you don't mind getting wet. The falls combined with the flame is a unique experience.",
          "A hidden gem. Very unique falls with a short hike. Just to be on a safe side carry a lighter so that if by any chance the flame is not there you can light it back real quick.",
          "Good but slippery do not wear shoes wear boots no matter what season you're in. Good for kids but dangerous on most parts",
          "So amazing",
          "Nice trekking experince for summer.  Beautiful greenery around. Avoid in snow as tracks may become dangerous.",
          "A nice little park with a creek walk to the flame. May be hard for some at certain points but overall not too difficult!",
          "Kind of a neat natural wonder.  Problem is that the trail to it is in really bad shape.  Best way to get to it is to wade up the creek (knee deep or less).  Otherwise you will have to go sperlunking through fallen trees.  It's an adventure!  Don't plan on staying clean when you go see the place.",
          "Great time an beautiful walk not to much of a hike but still fun!!!",
          "Other than dog poop and bags of dog poop accentuated trails and a rough parking lot, the rest was beautiful and worth the effort.",
          "It is gorgeous!  Beautiful falls and flame.  It is not easy. We had to climb under and over limbs through the water and mud. Your shoes will get muddy and wet but it is so worth it! Just stay on the path and enjoy!",
          "Really nice .5 mile hike to the flame. It was raining so it was muddy so maybe a little more dangerous climbing around but we did it and it was worth it.",
          "A nice hike along the river bed to see the eternal flame beneath a waterfall. If you begin the hike at the dirt parking lot off of 277 or Chestnut Ridge Rd it is less than a mile to get to the flame and takes no time at all. The trail is \u2026",
          "Very nice walk. A little muddy in spots; bring your hiking boots!",
          "Amazing place to visit. It was very slippery because of the ice, but oh, so beautiful\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Well worth the 20 minute trek to the bottom of the creek",
          "Great short hike in all weather. I\u2019ve completed it in each season and I like each cod different reasons , but the winter hike is my favorite. Be prepared for slight declines and inclines, if In summer you should likely wear waterproof or \u2026",
          "Loved this trail dont recommended to go in winter we never got to see the flame but the walk and the hicked was worth it.. \n\nWe are going back in summer..",
          "Still making wonderful wings.",
          "Beautiful walk that is not too difficult. A bit of climbing but very worth it. I wish we had walked the extra loop.",
          "Great hike, better on sunny days.",
          "Was a tad bit muddy out there.",
          "Did this fun exciting hike with my lovely awesome fiance and a friend. My fiance and I wore sandals and had our 2 puppies. It was challenging but fun to look forward to seeing the eternal flame at the end. It was worth it",
          "No bathrooms, well designed trail and the last half runs in an active creek bed which can be slippery and muddy at times. My young kids had no problems with a little bit of our assistance, strongly recommend grippy shoes. Definitely worth the trip and an amazing sight. FYI it\u2019s smells like natural gas by the flame which is normal.",
          "Beautiful place. The trail was a lot harder than I realized so definitely wear suitable shoes and clothing. Stay on the designated trail!",
          "Nice country hike. Bring a lighter.eternal flame sometimes needs to be lit.",
          "There was a lot of parking with a sign so you knew it was for The Eternal Flame Fall. There were maps provided and also signs numbered from 1 to 20 with a little flame next to it so you knew what path to follow to get to the falls. After \u2026",
          "This was definitely worth the hike to get to the falls. If you love nature, this is a place you will want to experience. Be prepared to get your feet wet and wear shoes that have good traction to avoid slipping on wet surfaces.",
          "The difficulty of the hike depends on the water level and if you're willing to get your feet wet. If you are, then it's very easy. If you're trying to keep your feet relatively dry, then during times of high water level, you'll have to be \u2026",
          "A little icey for the little ones but still fun.",
          "Short hike to the falls. It is a very well mark trail, However, it was very wet and slippery when we hiked in late November",
          "Small hike to the flame but beautiful and cool. ALWAYS  WEAR BOOTS I've gone three times during the fall and spring seasons and it has always been muddy so BE PREPARED! PSA: don't climb the rock, it's shale therefore very weak and prone to \u2026",
          "Pretty easy to find.  Short but steep hike in and out.  This is a good 1-2 hour activity.  Worth seeing.",
          "Nice Light hike for a nice and unique payoff. Absolutely worth a detour",
          "Chestnut Ridge in general is as beautiful a spot as youre going to find in this region.",
          "Prepared to get wet or dirty.   The hike to the falls is downhill and very easy to get to.  The hike back to the parking lot is a strenuous hike back uphill.  Bring a hiking stick possibly.   The flame, although small, was very cool to see \u2026",
          "The trails here range from easy to hard. Lots of plants, animals, and beautiful scenery. Always bring a camera! This place is a treat every time I go.",
          "The hike is beautiful all four seasons, however, it can be a rough hike in the winter with icy hills. Our whole family has been hiking there for over 15 years. Through the years there are changes to the trail because of destructive people using it, but it is still a very worth while experience.",
          "half a mile walk to the flame. parking space is good. nice place",
          "Worth checking out",
          "Awesome place to take a walk with the family and kids.  Moderate hiking involved to see the Eternal Flame.  About a 20 - 30 minute walk from the parking lot. No cost!!",
          "My favorite place to unwind",
          "Our favorite place for hiking.",
          "Good little hike. Flame is kept lit with natural gas. Can smell it as you approach. Walking stick and good grip shoes recommend.",
          "Beautiful!",
          "A great hike for even the most inexperienced climber.  \n\nThe reward at the end, is fantastic.    Totally worth the about 1 hr hike in and out.",
          "Always a good place to visit.  Well marked Trail.. Make sure to go when the water is high, the falls are much better this way.",
          "Great hike with a surprise ending",
          "it is a place for a good hike!",
          "It was beautiful",
          "Make sure to wear good walking shoes that you don't mind getting dirty. Kinda of slippery in certain spots, but once you get to the eternal flame it is an amazing experience.",
          "Was small and somewhat of a let down when I made it there. I blame it partically on all the downed trees. Maybe there had been a fire? It was beautiful but the path had bern washed away and was rough looking the closer we got to the flame.\n\nI'd try it again in a few years.",
          "Lovely place",
          "I am one who likes those little unique out of the way places.  Was interesting to see a flame burning behind the falls. Not for those with mobility issues.",
          "To get the actual flame it is a decently long hike (10-30 minutes) and there are some very steep inclines. There are a couple places that if you fell you would receive serious injuries, if not worse. You should be fine as long as you stay \u2026",
          "A good short trail. Had a lot of people going back and forth. The nature was beautiful and the flame was cool. You can smell the gas when you get close. Anyways, wouldn't recommend bring small children like toddlers or babies. There's mud \u2026",
          "Lots of fun for the whole family. The hike down isn't too difficult.",
          "You can make it a nice quick hike under an hour to get there or many hours of trails to hike around.",
          "Short hike in great falls",
          "Be careful....no flip flops. A nice walk along a slippery creekbed. Neat flame  its busy too.",
          "A great hike. Be prepared to walk through some water though!",
          "Good idea to have proper footwear... this is a strenuous hike for individuals that are not used to hiking/climbing... well worth the hike!",
          "The hike felt further than half mile on a not accessible trail. If you can do it, it's pretty cool. If not the trails you can access are pretty great too.",
          "Love this place",
          "Fun! The trail is a river bed, so probably not ideal while raining.",
          "Park is excellent  would love people to be considerate and leave their dogs home specially in a crowded day and narrow trails. Must wear hiking shoes  there are wet crossings",
          "Being local, enjoyed the flame far more before they \"modernized\" it and made it easy for anyone to find",
          "Good hike. Be ready to climb a little. Might have to go under or over fallen trees. Wear shoes you don't mind getting wet or muddy.",
          "Nice half-mile moderately difficult walk to a really cool naturally occurring eternal flame resulting from a gas seep in a tiny overhang inside a waterfall.  Would recommend highly!",
          "Wonderful experience to a truly unique natural wonder.  Trail needs work as the popularity has destroyed much of the natural beauty.  Stay on the trail to protect the gorge from erosion.",
          "Amazing! You can never see this to many times.",
          "An amazing trail and hiking. Not everyone can make it, specially when the snow turns into a black ice. We definitely enjoyed the trail to the falls. Totally worth it.",
          "I found out about this hike on a hiking Facebook group. It was short, but pretty intense. It's a steep descent down into a creekbed. It's slippery, and there were many fallen trees. Be prepared to walk in water. When we finally got to the \u2026",
          "Moderate to difficult trail depending on your hiking experience. Wear good waterproof hiking boots or prepare to have wet feet. Little kids can make the trip. I took my daughter and she is seven and had little difficulty, my fourteen year \u2026",
          "I like",
          "Easy hike",
          "This is my favorite place to hike in western new york. I live in Buffalo, and its pretry flat there. This lush nature spot is less than a 40min drive away from Buffalo and totally worth it. The eternal flame is neat, but some of the trails \u2026",
          "It's a nice hike, but there was a lot of people, and too many dogs. The dogs were barking and it took away from the serenity of the attraction, not to mention peeing all over. Be respectful people",
          "So bitter cold not the time to go, too icy to hike. But normally fabulous place to be.",
          "A little walk so be prepared",
          "Short hike from road.   Interesting attraction. Very little flow at this time of year",
          "Great for hiking! and always cool to see that flame burning non stop. Beautiful spot in wny",
          "Trail is a bit tricky and not good after recent rain as it becomes slippery",
          "Really cool hike but no maintenance has been done for years it seems so the paths are all but gone along the creek.",
          "Only one in the entire world, bring a lighter in case it's out....that is not a joke",
          "The coolest thing ever. You need to see it with your own eyes to believe it!",
          "Great mycology and wildlife. Would not recommend bringing infants and allow enough time to get out before sunset",
          "A very well worn and known trail, it's hard to miss. It has its own parking lot and the trail blazes are impossible to miss. It's almost impossible to experience the flame alone, since everyone in WNY with kids does this trail, since it's \u2026",
          "Go early or late. Heavily used trail",
          "Great family walk. Easy for most. I had a 3,5 and 7 year old with me and it was manageable. Bring a lighter with you just in case the flame is out. ",
          "A great place to go hiking with the family and dogs or alone. Many different trails to take.",
          "Amazing to see. Went in winter and would recommend waterproof boots and/or ice cleats as part of the hike is on the creek.",
          "Beautiful place! Bring your old sneakers (they will likely get wet and/or dirty), a friend to walk with, and a water bottle. The hike took me a little longer than I anticipated. Plan to be the for at least an hour.",
          "Beautiful hike, great for family",
          "Really cool place to hike with some friends.",
          "So cool! Trail isn't that obvious but follow the flame emojis and you're all set.",
          "Nature's own miracle",
          "Nice little hike to the flame. Can be pretty slippery and muddy. Very pretty and worthwhile",
          "You have to relight the flame as it doesnt stay lit. Fun and easy path",

          "The trail was great it was a lot of fun can't wait to take my kid next time",
          "It was beautiful. I have been before when there were a lot of people there, but today it was empty and foggy and a little rainy and it was perfect.",
          "It's amazing! A flame under the Falls. It was a challenging hike if you were trying to stay dry in early April. If you hike in the summer or spring and don't mind walking in the water it would be less physical. There is no clear path the whole way. It is super muddy after a rain. ",
          "Wonderful park. Lots of trails which are well marked.",
          "Just so beautiful. Natural and amazing. Watch for roots while walking.",
          "Beautiful and inspiring! And even pretty well equipped for you Poke'mon Go players! ;) once you spin the photodisc on the gym be sure to read the description! Have fun be SAFE and use your best judgement while traversing this rich western NY landscape!",
          "A local landmark. Slightly more than one mile round trip hike over varied terrain, mostly wooded, moderate difficulty for most people. The falls presents a great photo op.",
          "Not as exiting as you think it would be but definitely a must",
          "Rugged and terrain and alot of elevation change. But well worth it.",
          "Nice walk but be aware that the flame isn't always lit.",
          "Nice small hike down to the actual falls. The falls itself was a sight to see. Very cool! Ill be going again",
          "Hell of a hike lol",
          "I loved it:)",
          "Short peaceful hike. The flame is past the big red sign that says don't climb the waterfall!",
          "So cool! A little challenging for the little ones but definitely doable.",
          "Not a fully detail hike, steep at some areas but short and fun",

          "Short hike to the falls (not challenging at all, just some careful steps crossing the stream). If some trees fall down, it might become more challenging. There are other trails to stretch out the hike if you want to hike further than the \u2026",
          "A bit of a tough hike but it is worth it and very beautiful to see the eternal flame.",

          "The half mile numbered hike from the closest parking lot is not bad if you have good knees.  The hike to the flame is mainly downhill.  The return one may find some of the uphill segments to be a little stressful.  It can be a little tricky \u2026",
          "Google brought us to the side of the road on Seufert Road in Orchard Park. We followed an unmarked trail down to a stream. We got confused and a little lost. That's when we found the actual parking lot and met some people along the way. \u2026",
          "A \"must see\" location. Hike over-all is ~500m, the last 150 or so up a creekbed which can be slippery in spots. Bring proper footwear for a day hike. Trails are all very well marked and maintained in the upper sections. The creekbed trail \u2026",

          "One of the best trails I ever been.",
          "Let me set the expectation, it's a small FF lame which is in a small cave. Be prepared to do a small trek/hike of 2 to 2.5 miles. It's worth walking the distance.",
          "First time here and it was a fun little hike there and back.",
          "Great hike, beautiful scenery like out of a.movie\n We went with my 7 year old and my 2 year old. Would not recommend for children under 2 , the hike can be pretty steep and slippery.",

          "I felt the eternal flames are artificial. cause it is juat a lil bit of water flowing down the rocks and in between is a flame that is glowing. This flame is as small is smaller than a camp fire. So ya dont expect you mind to be blown after you reach the destination. But ya,  for me the trip with my friends made this memorable.",

          "Very awesome hike. Just note that your feet will most likely get wet so wear shoes you do not mind getting wet. Also the rocks on the hike and near the falls are slippery. Nice walk through the woods. A decent amount of uphill walking on the way back but not bad. Really cool",
          "What a beautiful, sweet little reason to go on a beautiful, sweet little hike. The flame was more gorgeous than I could have anticipated. There was a thunderstorm above us but I didn't care. I felt like I was exploring the torrid jungles of Isla Nublar, with a prehistoric",

          "This is a hike, not a walk. You will get wet feet. Only about ankle deep, but very cold in the winter. If you make the trek in the winter, give yourself a merit badge. Numerous trees and obstacles to get over, under, or around. Make no mistake, if you\u2019re up for the",
          "I've been told that this might be the only waterfall in the world with an active gas release behind it! It is a wonderful place that has become a lot busier over the years and I tell myself that is a good thing, because more and more people will want to protect our parks if",

          "This is a cool natural feature to see. It's a relatively short hike, maybe 20-25 minute walk. It's a little slippery in spots, but you'll know where. I think it's a great idea to stop by earlier in the morning or maybe before dinner-time so there are fewer people. We went with a",
          "The hike in is definitely close to a mile. The path is well marked however there are a lot of roots and uneven ground. A portion of the trail is along the river bank. Definitely take your time and watch your footing. You may have to step into the river in a few places. The falls",

          "This was such a pleasant find! Short hike that changes elevation by about 130 feet over a half mile trail. Thanks to the Boy Scouts for clearly marking the trail! Some sections are steep but overall a moderate trail with some hazards (rocks and tree roots). It was a peaceful",
          "This is a nice hike of just about a mile round trip. It's very shady in many spots, so the trail stays wet after rain and can be slippery. When we went this morning, there was some water in the creek beds, but there were enough dry spots that we were able to cross without",
          "First, we love Chestnut Ridge park for many reasons. Although, This hike to the eternal flame is a different experience. You must wear practical hiking shoes. It is mainly shaded, and has damp crumbling shale. Once you make it to the flame, it is like a flicker in a tiny cave.",
          "The eternal flame has been in Chestnut Ridge Park for as long as I can remember. It is an amazing thing to see - but it is so important that you stay on the trail to the flame when walking there. Many tree roots and a very steep drop off - not directly by the trail and fine if",

          "We love to hike Falls. I found this on the top 10 of Upstate NY. We set out w GPS and passed it because the signage can only be seen from the opposite direction. After an hour and multiple gps, google maps, etc we did make our way there. It was early April and after a good rain.",

          "Went for a hike with my two kids ages 10 and 12. Was an easy hike for us all. It hadn't rained in quite some time, the creek was dry. May be a bit more challenging after some rain. There were many families there with small kids too. Nobody seemed to be having difficulty",

          "The hike isn't very long--only about 3/4 of a mile, but after about halfway, it did get a bit precarious. It had been very dry and the creek didn't have much water in it, so I'm not sure how it would have been with the water. As long as you keep an eye for the flame cutouts on",

          "I had done some research on Eternal Flame Falls and just knew my husband would love the hike and seeing the flame. Please wear real hiking shoes...not flip flops or dress shoes. This is a hike. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get down to the falls/flame. We took some",
          "My husband and I went for a quick hike to the falls and brought our Great Dane with us. She loved the creek and we had a blast. The only issue, people were letting their kids rock climb up the ravine! Please please please don't do that! A teen lost his life last year doing so!",
          "Went for a Father's Day hike with 3 kids ages: 9/7/3. The weather had been dry so we could walk through easily. Even the little one was able to do most of it. Got right up close to the eternal flame. Wear good sneakers and bring water. Took us about 1hr 30 min",
          "My daughter found this location on the Roadtrippers site, and there was also a geocache at it, so we had to go while on our road trip. I'm very glad we did. It was a beautiful morning and no one else was around. Definitely wear hiking shoes and expect to get a little muddy,",
          "It is an amazing natural beauty! We went there own the way Niagara Falls. We were so excited about The Falls and we almost changed our minds about going Eternal Flame Falls. I'm glad that we made it there! It was a fascinating experience. however I want to warn you about",
          "Quite possibly one of the coolest things I have ever seen. You have to make the trek though the woods to see it for yourself.",
          "The eternal flame is located a short distance ~ 1 /2 miles from the car park. The hike to get there is fairly easy but may be wet as there is a stream. The draw back is the flame is now so popular that when we went last time it was crowded and loud.",
          "Having time to kill one day while waiting to pick up my daughter at the airport, my five year old granddaughter and I set out to see The Eternal Flame Falls. First off, make sure you have adequate footwear on. We were not prepared for hiking, and our sandals made this more",
          "It is becoming more and more regulated, safer for the families. You now have more routes than ever and can be a quick walk in if time is short.",
          "One of the beat places to hike! It used to be very secretive but now it seems as if everybody knows about it! Especially now that there is a main entrance! I used to take a trail off a side road and hike there! Beautiful view and a nice hike! Cant wait for the weather to break",
          "The eternal flame is a must for hikers of all ages. children should always be accompanied by an adult of responsible nature. Small children should not attempt this hike. You must stay on the trail to ensure the best safety and take precautions when necessary. It is a great place",
          "Loved eternal flame since I was a kid. Disappointed to see it turn into a tourist attraction. Paved parking lot with buses full of people. We're losing a natural treasure.",
          "During a recent stay at Niagara Falls for our anniversary (in November), we drove south into New York to see this natural attraction. It is about half an hour from Buffalo. The trail was deserted at this time of year -- we saw no one once we started walking. The entire trail",
          "The hike through the park is not for the faint of heart. You need to be sure footed and agile. But the trip is worth the end result. When you reach the eternal flame through the woods and through the creek to the waterfall that encases the flame it is a joy to behold. I",
          "The Eternal Flame is a short, 25-minute drive from Buffalo and is a wonderful destination in any season. Many people visit year-round and it's easy to follow trails/tracks to see this incredible site: a shale waterfall with a burning flame amid the water. It's a pleasant hike",
          "A peaceful and tranquil morning hike on an early fall day brought me upon the Eternal Flame. I was very happy to see the flame \"lit\" as I had forgotten to bring something to light it, in case it was not lit. The morning dew and fall foliage cascaded the wooded area and I had",
          "This short hike (1/2 mile each way) leads to a waterfall, worth the hike in it's own right, with the curiosity of an eternal flame natural methane seep. The trail is easy for its' first halt then descends along a moderately steep line into the ravine. The last section is",
          "We had friends visiting from out of town and took them to see the eternal flame. They loved it! Stay on the trail and it's a nice little hike. My four year old also took part in the trek to the flame. If you take your time most anyone could make it down this trail. Be sure",
          "Quick stroll through the woods, down a slope to a creek bed, then up the creek to this cozy little spot where flames peek out from behind a waterfall.",
          "Highly recommended! 1st off, this isn't actually in the park itself, so don't go into the park entrance..its farther down the road, past the main entrance. If you put Eternal Flame hiking Trail into you GPS it will get you to the actually trail park. You can't miss the parking",
          "We read the Tripadvisor reviews to get prepared. My husband and I are moderate hikers and need to know the challenges ahead. The reviews were very informative from people who were there. I was a short hike, not a short walk The path is muddy with tree roots to help with footing.",
          "Nice walk through the Chestnut Ridge ( County Park ) woods. Path is pretty clearly marked ( but with tree roots protruding in spots). Ample parking at trailhead and clearly marked off Chestnut Ridge Rd. Flame is located in cove located in middle of a slow flowing creek bed. It",

          "A totally unique thing that I never knew about growing up 5 miles away. A nice walk in the woods on a warm summer day. It is a short walk (less than a mile) but if it was wet it would be difficult on the down hill and up hill. The last section is up the creek bed with shale and",
          "We drove through the park trying to find it, but it was not easy. Once we got it though it was a pleasant walk -- it is safe, however some people choose to climb the steep muddy cliffsides and endanger themselves. If you stick to the well marked path there are no problems. The",
          "The Eternal Flame is a beautiful natural wonder. We hiked on a dry weekend. I wouldn't want to try to get to it after a rain. Trails are safe and marked well. It is IMPORTANT to stay on the trails. Venturing off the trails can cause injury, or worse. It can be a steep climb, so",
          "The hike down to the Eternal Flame Falls is Well graded and should be easily accessible by most people. It's well marked and the trail is graded. For the rest of the day, Chestnut ridge has a playground, disc. golf, tennis courts, picnic shelters with grills, and on a clear",

          "I visited this place in high school back in the early 70's before it was publicized. It was only known to the locals at that time. Now it is a major attraction and there are paths to it. Personally, I wish it hadn't been made known to the world.",
          "I was traveling to see friends from Florida and we went. The hike was fun and adventurous with some squishy areas and trees to climb over. The waterfalls were gorgeous however, the flame wasn't lit at the time and our lighter got wet and wouldn't work. It had rained a lot the",

          "Living nearby makes me partial to this natural wonder, but it makes for a fun little hike in and an adventurous climb out if your up to it, or just a hike back the way you came in. Going on a dry day a couple days after a rain makes the hike all the easier as the creek/brook",
          "It is not straight and plain path to reach the destination. A lot of obstacles a long the way, but that is the fun way even with the children. The path is not wide enough for smooth walking in 2 direction, so i don't know when is the best day and time to avoid quite jam to the",

          "Our family decided to visit this attraction. I have 2 boys (9 and 7). It was so much fun. Definately a hike and we got lost initially but soon found the trail. So worth the hike. It was a wonderful day and I highly recommend checking this out. But I agree it many of the",

          "Chestnut Ridge Park is a wonderful place to visit. Its crowning glory, I think, is Eternal Flame Falls at the southernmost portion of the park. (You have to drive past the main entrance to Seufert Rd.) It is a long creekwalk but worth the effort. There is a lovely waterfall at",

          "Great hike for famililies - I have brought my kids when they were preschoolers with no problem. Hike is about 1.5 hrs round trip if you take your time and enjoy nature. Wear shoes that you can get wet as you will be following a creek for part of the hike. Off street parking",
          "It is best described by seeing it yourself. Well worth the adventure. Nature at its best. The hiking is mild to moderate. The scenery and smell of the woods is breathe taking. There is a variety of plant life to explore. When friends and family visit, this should definitely be a",
          "I has heard of the eternal flame, so on my trip to Western New York we made a stop to see it. We made our way to the trail entrance, where you find a clearly marked map of the trails to the flame. Once we mapped our route we walk through a field of wild flowers and bees",
          "Off a side road at Chestnut Ridge Park, we parked and hiked a small trail through the forest. Even in midsummer there are certain areas that are muddy or slippery, requiring extra caution at times. Hiking with kids, like we were, takes some extra time to climb over some rocks.",

          "Walking through Chestnut Ridge Park to the Eternal Flame is well worth a visit for those that enjoy the natural outdoors and do not mind the hike. It can be a challenging hike if it is wet and muddy. For those who love lingering in the woods and appreciated the natural beauty",
          "This is a pleasant hike in the woods. However, if it is muddy, perhaps not so pleasant as you are going up and down some hills and through a creek (usually it is easy enough to jump from bare rock to bare rock, but if it has rained a lot recently, not easy to stay dry at all).",
          "Hiked to the waterfall after it had rained all night. There is usually not much water in the creek, but there was when I did the hike because of the rain overnight. The hike to the falls is only about 1/2 mile. The last part of the hike is in the creek itself or on the banks.",

        "wiki": "Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel is a casino in Niagara Falls, New York. It was built by the city to compete with Casino Niagara and Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Formerly known as the Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center, it was taken over by the federally recognized Seneca Nation of New York.\nThe casino floor has an area of 147,000 sq ft (13,700 m2) with 99 gaming tables and 4,200 slot machines. It is the largest hotel in New York state outside of Manhattan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Seneca Niagara Casino opened in 2002, the result of an $80 million transformation of the Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center into a full-service casino. It features 82,000 square feet of gaming space with 2,595 slot machines and 91 table games.\n\n\n== Restaurants ==\nWestern Door (Steakhouse)\nKoi (Asian Cuisine)\nLa Cascata (Italian Cuisine)\nThunder Falls Buffet\nBlues Burger Bar\nThree Sisters Caf\u00e9\nMorrie's Express\nTim Horton's and Cold Stone Creamery\n\n\n== Shopping ==\nSky Boutique\nSwarovski\nSeasons\nThe NewsStand\nPlayer's Club Store\nYankee Candle\nWatson's Chocolates\nTEN\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\nThe Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel is home to the Seneca Niagara Events Center, a 2,400-seat theater that has hosted various performing artists, including Stevie Nicks, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Martina McBride, Trace Adkins, Lewis Black, Lisa Lampanelli, Steely Dan, Heart, Steve Miller Band, Huey Lewis and the News, Gretchen Wilson, Air Supply, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross, Blondie, Jeff Foxworthy, Jay Leno, The Moody Blues, Grand Funk Railroad, Cheap Trick, Jim Gaffigan, New Kids on the Block, Seth Meyers, The Pointer Sisters, Chicago, The Go-Go's, Bobby Vinton, Tracy Morgan, Jackson Browne, Frank Caliendo, Michael Bolton and more.\nIn addition, the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel has the Bear's Den Showroom, a 440-seat theatre that presented more intimate shows, such as The Goo Goo Dolls, Eddie Money, The Grass Roots, Lou Gramm, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Little River Band, Mary Wilson, Richard Marx and more.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nIn February 2008, the Seneca Gaming Corp. announced the expansion of the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel Property. It will add more hotel rooms, and other amenities. It acquired Fallsville Splash Park, located next to the Seneca Niagara Casino, which was condemned by the State of New York and transferred to the Seneca Gaming Corporation. It was demolished for Phase 2 of expansion of the Niagara Falls casino.\n\n\n== Legal Issues ==\n\n\n=== Adjacent properties owned by Seneca Gaming Corp. ===\nAdjacent properties owned by the Seneca Gaming Corporation are not located on Seneca territory owned by the Nation, therefore it is technically illegal to put slot machines or provide for gambling. The Splash Park Property where Phase 2 of expansion is to take place is also located on non-sovereign land.\nThe former Convention Center is located on sovereign land, and the casino is operated by Gaming Corporation.\n\n\n=== Taxing of non-sovereign adjacent properties owned by the Gaming Corporation ===\nUse of the surrounding area adjacent to the Seneca Niagara Casino by the Seneca Nation for gaming has been the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed by attorney John Bartolomei in October 2010 on behalf of Fallsite LLC and residents who are angry over a 4% tax hike to be passed in 2011. The Seneca Niagara Casino is located on sovereign land owned by the Seneca Nation of Indians.\nBut, the land adjacent to the casino, including parking garages adjacent to Niagara St., the site of a former Pizza Hut on the corner of Niagara St. and John B. Daly Blvd., the Holiday Inn property on the corner of 3rd Street and Duggar Drive, the former Niagara Aerospace Museum in between 3rd and 4th Streets and Niagara Street and Wendel Way, the former E. Dent Lackey Plaza (now a parking lot) in between Wendel Way, Duggar Drive, 3rd Street and 4th Street, former private homes on 5th and 6th Streets, and the Splash Park Property on the corner of Falls Street and John B. Daly Blvd, are owned by the Seneca Gaming Corporation. The Seneca Gaming Corporation is non-sovereign and therefore taxable, but was left off the city tax rolls. If taxed, the corporation would be the largest payer of taxes in the City of Niagara Falls.\n\n\n== Other properties ==\nThe Seneca Nation operates other gaming casinos on its property in New York state: \n\nSeneca Allegany Casino - This facility in Salamanca, New York, on the Allegany Indian Reservation, features a casino, spa, six restaurants and a new hotel completed in 2007.\nSeneca Buffalo Creek Casino - Seneca Nation's newest casino is located in downtown Buffalo, New York.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nJCJ ARCHITECTURE ~ Architects for SNC & SAC",

          "Since Seneca Niagara  has reopened, we have been 4 times (different times of the day) and the machines are very tight. Its just not fun to go anymore. If both of us arent winning anything, its not worth it for us to drive so far to come \u2026",

          "Great hotel, the rooms were well-kept and very clean and modern. The bathroom is beautiful with a large shower and the hotel is a close distance to the falls. If you aren't there for the casino avoid it as much as possible though, because they allow smoking inside the casino area and it's a horrible place to work through.",
          "I enjoy going to the Seneca Niagara casino. They have a great buffet. They have more gambling machines and I can count. The only thing I wish they had more of was shopping stores. Otherwise I highly recommend this place. A great place to go and spend part of the day especially in the winter \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d",

          "It was a nice layout for a casino compared to other casinos we've been to. It is mainly a smoking casino but there is a average sized section for non smokers to play. You have to walk through the smoking section from either direction to get \u2026",

          "The employees were very nice and security as well. This guy name Erik stuck out though at the cash/redemption desk, he was so funny and nice. Very good at explaining all the things I asked about and had a good joking yet professional \u2026",
          "26 story nice and well maintained and best casino in the US side. Once you move in you won't make it out whether its day or night outside of the casino. It also has one of the best restaurant. Great place",
          "We've been going to Seneca for about 10 years about 5 x a year. Was always the best altogether. They have renovated recently which brought in an amazing lobby but a big drop in the rest of the casino. We were there a few weeks ago and found \u2026",

          "From the restaurant's, pool, hotel room's, to the gaming floor I've always had a good experience!  Let's face it, we don't always come out a winner but I always have the best time and I'm not sure who has more fun?  Us guests or the \u2026",

          "Had a wonderful weekend, everything was lovely. The room was fantastic and the staff was wonderful with room service. Can't wait for our next visit!",
          "Got there at 3:30 -- said we couldn't check in until 4:00.  Would call/page us when the room was ready,  Didn't hear back so went to front desk at 4:30 and they checked us in then,",
          "The casino is definitely a destination on the USA side of the Falls.  Really nice rooms friendly staff. Week day room rates are very good.  Only downside is the overwhelming smoke in the casino. With a full capacity crowd you would not be able to breathe.",
          "Birthday weekend with twin sister\nWould of been great, if we won big\nThe food was really good at the Buffet,\n alot to choose from.\nTook some great picture of area views.\nIn walking distance of the falls.\nThe only problem was the hotel,",
          "This is situated in a great location and very easy to get to so it makes it easy to find. It features plenty of gaming and restaurants. It also has a variety of hotels to choose from on premises or near by. So come take a look if possible.",
          "Nice casino. Good place to play, stay or see a show. Good place for a convention or trade show.",
          "I wish I could say this was perfect. Loved the view and a wonderfully relaxing stay. My only issue was with the hot tub. It looked very clean but after running water and about to get in, I turned on the light in the water. There particulate \u2026",
          "They allow smoking in the casino. I'm not a smoker so it limited me experience. I had to leave after a while as some man was smoking a cigar. The buffet was good.",
          "Seneca is the best hotel in Niagara! It's huge, but very clean, large rooms with spectacular view, it has a great style, mixed people, large casino where you can get a free buffet only to register, for a tourist it's a real American \u2026",
          "This hotel is great. Clean and the rooms are huge! My only complaint is that the pool was filled with kids. We went back when it was adults only and there was still lots of kids. Nobody seems to enforce the rule. But other than that, wonderful stay!",
          "Fantastic hotel & casino. Restaurants were excellent as well. Only negative would be the amount of smoking in the casino. There is a no smoking area. But all the bars, clubs & entertainment are in the smoking area. With that said, I would recommend it to anyone.",
          "The best casino if you want to throw money away. Bonus's are few and you'd be lucky to get your bet back. The only good thing is The Western Door restaurant.",
          "Beautiful love the hotel area! And the showers are glorious!! I could stay in those waterfall ones forever. Will definitely come back!",
          "This is a nice casino. Good slots, nice airy feel. Table games are unusually spread out, which actually works. Free self parking a plus. Good food.",
          "Clean. They got most of the new games. A little tight on the weekends and because I'm a smoker and u can smoke anywhere, it's more appealing to me. Mind u, they do have non smoking sections in the casino. Close to many hotels and right next to the rainbow bridge Canada-US border in Niagara falls",
          "People that love to gamble, this is probably the place for you! Unfortunately, I am not that person. I've never been to a casino before an this was extremely foreign to me. I was definitely out of my element like a fish out of water. But it's a huge place with ask the bells and whistles. A gamblers dream I'm sure.",

          "It was awesome would go back for sure. Nice and clean the rooms were spacious. I cant say enough about this place. Nice and new looking.",
          "Second time we have been there. The rooms are stylish and very clean. The casino is partially smoking so for nonsmokers that can be quite a turn off. we are non-smokers and didn't find it to be too bad and the staff really kept the place \u2026",
          "Next to border, so invites Canadians in America.\nCasino is great to hang out as well",
          "The buffet place is under construction. So they moved it to the back of the hotel near the meeting rooms. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so small. Wish they had given us the option to go in and see how the food was. Very terrible. They should put \u2026",
          "Had a great time with my wife so much so we had to go back the next night! Friday night live music is great! Tons of fun but had to drag my wife out she didn\u2019t want to leave! lol",
          "Came to play tables. It was hard to find a table with a dealer who could count. Also the suits are always huddled together talking instead of monitoring those dealers. \nAte at the buffet, the server was awesome. Security people were pretty friendly as well.\nRoom was fantastic.",

          "Our first time in a hotel/casino. We loved every minute of our stay. Only one thing was disappointing...when I heard buffet...I was thinking oh wow a real super duper ayce set up. I was disappointed that it looked really badly thrown \u2026",
          "Amazing staff, entertainment, music and great bar. The TV\u2019s are huge and offer a second to none experience. All the properties are always clean. Really enjoy all the talents they are bringing in, and the boxing. Something for everyone. Keep enhancing our area. Thanks",
          "It's an okay casino and a very nice hotel. Buffet was good. Security who constantly ask for the ID are annoying - cannot make a step without having them ask for my ID over and over again. And I am 30 years old. Never happened to me in other casinos more than once, this is ridiculous and made me feel quite uncomfortable, to say frankly.",
          "Had a Good time and lots of fun",
          "Clean quiet fun place to go",
          "This is a lovely place. We came for dinner at the Three Sisters restaurant. When we came in to the casino proper the stench of cigar and stale cigarettes was overpowering. But lessened as we went down to the floor.",
          "They used to have an awesome buffet restaurant but things have totally changed!!! I went there today with my family and found out the buffet was moved to some kind of hallways and meeting rooms. The price did not change but the number of \u2026",

          "Had a couples massage at the hotel spa. The services was amazing and the facility was beautiful!  We stayed to have lunch at the buffet and play some games. Getting a member card is definitely worth it! We got free buffet vouchers! Love it here!",

          "Well if was good food it was fun. To see the light go off it Was fun.",
          "Nice rooms. Falls are in walking distance. Food wasn't as good as before. If you go to gamble save your money you can't even get a bonus spin and when u do it's never very much. It would be nice to sit at a machine with out feeding the machine continuously. They Don't understand pay outs! They don't exist!",
          "Ever since the coronavirus machines are not hitting They don't serve alcohol and there's no smoking I might as well just come to the front door and hand them over my money",

          "Lots of fun slot machines. Loads of space, great restaurants. Close proximity to the falls.",
          "This casino was a HUGE disappointment.  The payouts are terrible,  and 3/4 of the machines are located in the smoking area. I don't know what the hotel itself is like, but I really didn't like the casino at all. Also, if you wanted to play \u2026",
          "Nice hotel, fun casino.  Buffet is being renovated so make plans to dine elsewhere.  There is a temporary buffet set up in meeting rooms, but its pretty grim and there is no discount (cost is the same as it was when there was an actual buffet)",
          "It has become very apparent to many Niagara Falls residents that the Seneca casinos are catering very much to the Canadian and Asian people with much better comps. Such as higher free play and free rooms more often. Also strange how a lot \u2026",
          "Very good options to eat an excellent location!",
          "The Buffett is usually delicious. Today the food was sub par at best. The room was nice but lacked towels for the couple of days that we were there. On the floor if we wanted a drink we waited almost an half hour for each drink. Previously this has never happened to us. Maybe they were understaffed.",
          "Temporary Buffet location during renovation, limited selection. Cashier was very honest about selection. Renovation should be done in June 2020",
          "Great place for a quick getaway. If you become a member you can get free night stay on weekdays and resort credits that can be used at hotel restaurants. Hotel rooms are clean and modern and staff is friendly",

          "We were on the 26th floor (highest) thanks to the employee who was very kind!!! The shower was HUGE and the best part of the room. They have security that before you board the elevator you must scan your hotel card which is great \u2026",

          "This was a good casino in my opinion. The payouts on slot machines were as most other casinos which isn't that great but does anyone expect differently? The men's restroom was clean and even though it was mostly smoking the air wasn't that \u2026",
          "First timers-choice of free buffet or $15 slot play. Dinner was $16.95 so we took it. Three large food stations-Grill, Mediterranean, Asian, plus soup/salad, desserts. Yummy all! Pasta station, several mixed salads, grilled peppers 12\" \u2026",

The non smoking area is small and has pretty limited tables and only a small selection of slots.\n\nRooms are also quite nice but I felt the comforter was too warm. Make your room cool at night!",
          "Visited for the free buffet that they advertise for new customers. There was quite a queue to register but I guess that's unsurprising. The food was pretty decent, not gourmet but definitely of $15 standard. I probably wouldn't rush back to \u2026",
          "It was a decent conceit Casino, there was a smoking in a non-smoking area, live music. The only problem I had was the waitresses to serve drinks on the floor I literally only saw one in the four hours I was there.",

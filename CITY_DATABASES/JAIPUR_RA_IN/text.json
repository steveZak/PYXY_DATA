        "wiki": "The City Palace, Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Jaipur is the present-day capital of the state of Rajasthan, and until 1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues to be the home of the Jaipur royal family. The royal family of Jaipur is said to be the descendants of Lord Rama. The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries, restaurants, and offices of the Museum Trust. The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust looks after the Museum, and the royal cenotaphs (known as chhatris).\n\n\n== Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust ==\nThe MSMS II Museum Trust is headed by chairperson Rajamata Padmini Devi of Jaipur (from Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh). Princess Diya Kumari runs the Museum Trust, as its secretary and trustee. She also manages The Palace School and Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh School in Jaipur. She founded and runs the Princess Diya Kumari Foundation to empower underprivileged and underemployed women of Rajasthan. She is also an entrepreneur. In 2013, she was elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly of Rajasthan from the constituency of Sawai Madhopur. The Trust was founded by Brig Sawai Bhawani Singh, the last titular Maharaja.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe palace complex lies in the heart of Jaipur city, to the northeast of the very centre, located at 26.9255\u00b0N 75.8236\u00b0E\ufeff / 26.9255; 75.8236. The site for the palace was located on the site of a royal hunting lodge on a plain land encircled by a rocky hill range, five miles south of Amber (city). The history of the city palace is closely linked with the history of Jaipur city and its rulers, starting with Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who ruled from 1699 to 1744. He is credited with initiating construction of the city complex by building the outer wall of the complex spreading over many acres. Initially, he ruled from his capital at Amber, which lies at a distance of 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur. He shifted his capital from Amber to Jaipur in 1727 because of an increase in population and increasing water shortage. He planned Jaipur city in six blocks separated by broad avenues, on the classical basis of principals of Vastushastra and another similar classical treatise under the architectural guidance of Vidyadar Bhattacharya, a Bengali architect from Naihati of present-day West Bengal who was initially an accounts-clerk in the Amber treasury and later promoted to the office of Chief Architect by the King.Following Jai Singh's death in 1857, there were internecine wars among the Rajput kings of the region but cordial relations were maintained with the British Raj. Maharaja Ram Singh sided with the British in the Sepoy Mutiny or Uprising of 1857 and established himself with the Imperial rulers. It is to his credit that the city of Jaipur including all of its monuments (including the City Palace) are stucco painted 'Pink' and since then the city has been called the \"Pink City\".The change in the colour scheme was as an honor of hospitality extended to the Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII) on his visit. This color scheme has since then become a trademark of the Jaipur city.Man Singh II, the adopted son of Maharaja Madho Singh II, was the last Maharaja of Jaipur to rule from the Chandra Mahal palace, in Jaipur. This palace, however, continued to be a residence of the royal family even after the Jaipur kingdom merged with the Indian Union in 1949 (after Indian independence in August 1947) along with other Rajput states of Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner. Jaipur became the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan and Man Singh II had the distinction of becoming the Rajapramukh (present-day Governor of the state) for a time and later was the Ambassador of India to Spain.While the Jaipur maharanis observed pardah, they enjoyed considerable power and agency.  Queens \u2013 often the senior-most (Pat-Rani) had a say in the governance of the kingdom or estate in the absence of the ruler. Two queens wielding full authority were Raja Man Singh of Dhoondhar's Bhati clan wife, and Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner's wife, Rani Ganga Bai. Wives and mothers of Rajput kings and chiefs also took upon themselves the role of counseling the men over issues they felt transgressed warrior codes of behavior and action.Women from ruling groups or warrior castes held property in their own names, with full rights over those lands. Many warrior clan women got lands for their maintenance as personal jagirs and haath-kharch ki jagir  (personal spending from the province) from both, their natal families, and the families they married into, and administered such lands through personal administrative agents (kamdars, amils, and dewans). From within zenanas, these women remained fully informed about their individual jagirs. Details about crops, law, and order, social problems, appeals from the peasantry, came to them through their stewards or agents, who took instructions directly from the women and were answerable only to them. The women used the revenues from their estates solely as they wished.places to visit in jaipur\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe City Palace is in the central-northeast part of the Jaipur city, which is laid in a unique pattern with wide avenues. It is a unique and special complex of several courtyards, buildings, pavilions, gardens, and temples. The most prominent and most visited structures in the complex are the Chandra Mahal, Mubarak Mahal, Shri Govind Dev Temple, and the City Palace Museum.\n\n\n=== Govind Dev Ji temple ===\nGovind Dev Ji temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Krishna, is part of the City Palace complex. Govind Dev an important deity, featured in many paintings, and on a large pichchawi (painted backdrop) on display in the Painting and Photography gallery.\n\n\n=== Entrance gates ===\n\nThe Udai Pol near Jaleb chowk, the Virendra Pol near Jantar Mantar, and the Tripolia (three pols or gates) are the three main entry gates of the City Palace. The Tripolia gate is reserved for the entry of the royal family into the palace. Common people and visitors can enter the place complex only through the Udai Pol and the Virendra Pol. The Udai Pol leads to the Sabha Niwas (the Diwan-e-Aam or hall of public audience) through a series of tight dog-leg turns. The Virendra Pol leads to the Mubarak Mahal courtyard, which in turn is connected to the Sarvato Bhadra (the Diwan-e-Khas) through the Rajendra Pol. The gateways were built at different times across the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries and are richly decorated in the contemporary architectural styles prevalent at the time.\n\n\n=== Sabha Niwas (Diwan-e-Aam) ===\n\nModeled on the lines of a Mughal hall of audience, the Diwan-e-Aam, the Sabha Niwas, is a hall of the public audience. It has multiple cusped arches supported by marble columns and a beautifully painted plaster ceiling. The jalis on the southern end of the hall would have been used by women to oversee the proceedings in the hall, and facilitated their involvement in the outside world, while following the purdah.\n\n\n=== Sarvato Bhadra (Diwan-e-Khas) ===\n\nThe Sarvato Bhadra is a unique architectural feature.  The unusual name refers to the building's form: a Sarvato Bhadra is a single-storeyed, square, open hall, with enclosed rooms at the four corners. One use of the Sarvato Bhadra was as the Diwan-e-Khas, or the Hall of Private Audience, which meant the ruler could hold court with the officials and nobles of the kingdom in a more private, intimate space than the grand spaces of the Sabha Niwas in the next courtyard, which was open to more people. But it's also one of the most important ritual buildings in the complex, and continues to be so today, representing as it does, \u2018living heritage\u2019. Because of its location between the public areas and the private residence, it has traditionally been used for important private functions like the coronation rituals of the Maharajas of Jaipur.\nToday, it continues to be used for royal festivals and celebrations like Dusshera. During Gangaur and Teej, the image of the goddess is placed in her palanquin in the centre of the hall, before being carried in procession around the city. During the harvest festival of Makar Sankranti, paper kites belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II who lived almost 150 years ago are displayed in the centre, and the roof is used for flying kites. It is also used for more modern celebrations like parties and weddings.\nThere are two huge sterling silver vessels of 1.6 metres (5.2 ft) height and each with capacity of 4000 litres and weighing 340 kilograms (750 lb), on display here. They were made from 14,000 melted silver coins without soldering. They hold the Guinness World Record as the world's largest sterling silver vessels. These vessels were specially commissioned by Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II to carry the water of the Ganges to drink on his trip to England in 1901 (for Edward VII's coronation). Hence, the vessels are named as Gangajalis (Ganges-water urns).\n\n\n=== Pritam Niwas Chowk ===\nIt is the inner courtyard, which provides access to the Chandra Mahal. Here, there are four small gates (known as Ridhi Sidhi Pol) that are adorned with themes representing the four seasons and Hindu gods. The gates are the Northeast Peacock Gate (with motifs of peacocks on the doorway) representing autumn and dedicated Lord Vishnu; the Southeast Lotus Gate (with continual flower and petal pattern) suggestive of summer season and dedicated to Lord Shiva-Parvati; the Northwest Green Gate, also called the Leheriya (meaning: \"waves\") gate, in green colour suggestive of spring and dedicated to Lord Ganesha, and lastly, the Southwest Rose Gate with repeated flower pattern representing winter season and dedicated to Goddess Devi.\n\n\n=== Chandra Mahal ===\n \nChandra Mahal is one of the oldest buildings in the City Palace complex. It has seven floors, a number considered auspicious by Rajput rulers. The first two floors consist of the Sukh Niwas (the house of pleasure), followed by the Rang Mahal (alternatively called Shobha Niwas) with coloured glasswork, then Chhavi Niwas with its blue and white decorations. The last two floors are the Shri Niwas, and Mukut Mandir which is literally the crowning pavilion of this palace. The Mukut Mandir, with a bangaldar roof, has the royal standard of Jaipur hoisted at all times, as well as a quarter flag (underscoring the Sawai in the title) when the Maharaja is in residence. \nThere is an anecdote narrated about the 'one and quarter flag', which is the insignia flag of the Maharajas of Jaipur. Emperor Aurangzeb who attended the wedding of Jai Singh, shook hands with the young groom and wished him well on his marriage. On this occasion, Jai Singh made an irreverent remark to the Emperor stating that the way he had shaken hands with him made it incumbent on the Emperor to protect him (Jai Singh) and his kingdom. Aurangzeb, instead of responding in indignation at the quip, felt pleased and conferred on the young Jai Singh the title of 'Sawai', which means \"one and a quarter\". Since then the Maharajas have pre-fixed their names with this title. During residence there, they also fly a one and a quarter size flag atop their buildings and palaces.\n\n\n=== Mubarak Mahal ===\n\nThe Mubarak Mahal courtyard at the City Palace was fully developed as late as 1900, when the court architect of the time, Lala Chiman Lal, constructed the Mubarak Mahal in its centre. Chiman Lal,  had worked with Samuel Swinton Jacob, the State's executive engineer, and also built the Rajendra Pol around the same time as the Mubarak Mahal, complementing it in style. The facade of the Mubarak Mahal has a hanging balcony and is identical on all four sides, the intricate carving in white (andhi marble) and beige stone giving it the illusion of delicate decoupage. The Mubarak Mahal was built for receiving foreign guests but it now houses the museum offices and a library on the first floor and the museum's Textile Gallery on the ground floor.\n\n\n=== The Clock Tower ===\n\nThe clock tower is a structure to the south of the Sabha Niwas. It is a sign of European influence in the Rajput court as the clock was installed in a pre-existing tower in 1873. The clock, purchased from Black and Murray & Co. of Calcutta, aimed to introduce a little Victorian efficiency and punctuality into court proceedings.\n\n\n== Galleries of the museum ==\n\n\n=== Sabha Niwas (Hall of Audience) ===\nThis is the main hall of audience. It is a large room with two thrones at the centre, a set of chairs around, as if in a durbar setting. On the walls of the halls are large format paintings of the Maharajas of Jaipur, a large picchwai (a backdrop for a shrine), large paintings depicting the colourful festival of holi, and a pair of paintings featuring spring and summer (possibly made in the Deccan). On display, you can also see military medals and polo trophies, marking the achievements of the rulers. The room is opulent in its decoration, with murals, and chandeliers. The current closed arches, on which the Holi paintings, and the Spring and Summer portrait hang, were closed in the recent times. Photos from the reign of Man Singh II, of the court in attendance, Lord and Lady Mountbatten's visit, line the corridor leading out to the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard.\n\n\n=== Textile Gallery ===\nThis gallery is situated on the ground floor of the Mubarak Mahal. On display are various kinds of textiles and fabrics, including Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I's atmasukha, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh's wedding jama, and a set of robes (angarakhas) belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II. Not to be missed is the rare pashmina carpet, made in Lahore or Kashmir around 1650. This gallery also has on display the Polo outfit and cups belonging Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and the billiards outfit of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II.\n\n\n=== Sileh Khana (Arms and Armour Gallery) ===\nThe Sileh khana showcases the many arms used by the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Jaipur and Amber. The gallery has a variety of swords, guns, powder flasks, shields, helmets, archer's rings, even ivory back-scratching tools! The collection features early 19th century swords with a variety of decorations on the handle as well as sword blade or Shamshir Shikargah. According to Robert Elgood, two of such pieces on display have chiselled animals down the length of the blade (a concept acquired from Europe that allows decoration to a greater effect) the blade has raised figures, buildings, animals and birds all highlighted in gold. There is true damascening in gold on the hilt as well as the blades. These swords were never used and purely made for decorative purposes. The hilts of the pieces displayed are of different styles and can be accurately dated to the workshop set up for Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II ( r. 1880 \u2013 1922).Highlights of the collection are a tulwar owned by Maharaja Ram Singh Ji II (1835\u201380) (name inscribed on the blade) which had a blade length of 54cms \u2013 bright steel, single-edged khanda blade with ricasso, shallow central fuller, and false edge. The blade is stamped at the forte with a Trishul and is heavier and shorter than normal indicating a special purpose. The gallery also showcases a tulwar which belonged to Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II (1912). The tulwar's hilt has chequered grip and pommel steel inlaid with silver flowers.Additionally, a beautifully painted shield featuring the clan goddess, Shila Mata, and hunting scenes, belonged to Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and is an exquisite object of the collection, and a must-see object. The case also has a child's turban in metal which mimics a fabric turban, and is a unique item.\nThe armour section showcases helmets \u2013 \u201cKhud\u201d. One of them is a 16th-century watered steel helmet which is rare to find. The helmet has been added with a false damascened band of decoration in the latter years of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II (19th century). Watered steel was extremely expensive and therefore used very sparingly.\n\n\n=== Painting and photography gallery ===\nOne of the newest galleries at The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum is the Painting and Photography Gallery, where paintings and photographs from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Jaipur are showcased. This gallery highlights the ways in which traditional artistic practices were transformed by political and cultural changes, modern technologies, and new materials.Art historians have subdivided Rajput painting, a form of painting that developed in the sixteenth century, based on the kingdoms from within they emerged: Marwar, Mewar, and Dhundhar. Jaipur, the capital of the kingdom of Dhundhar, developed its own unique style of painting. At the same time, artistic exchanges between the Mughal and Rajput courts led to the development of new hybrid painting styles that brought together regional Indian, Mughal, and Persian traditions. This was especially prevalent within the courts of kingdoms that were closely allied with the Mughal imperial court, such as Amber and Jaipur.\nCurrently, there are approximately 3,000 paintings housed in the MSMS II Museum, not including the paintings and manuscripts in the private collection of the royal family of Jaipur and in the kapad-dwara. These include original Mughal and Deccani paintings, Jaipur copies of Mughal paintings, paintings from other Rajput kingdoms, religious and secular paintings, illustrated manuscripts, small- and large-scale portraits, nature studies, paper-cut collages, and other miscellaneous subjects. Many of these are displayed in the Painting and Photography gallery. One of the most striking paintings in the collection is the artist Sahibram's large-scale composition of the Raas-lila. The painting is based on a re-enactment at the court, in which only women performed, even for the role of KrishnaThe photography collection at the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum consists of approximately 6,050 photographic prints, 1,941 glass plate negatives and photography equipment. This collection ranges from the 1860s to the 1950s and is unique due to its association with Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II, who was not only a collector and patron, but also a practitioner of photography.The photographic prints in the collection are mainly albumen and silver gelatin prints, on both printed and developed out paper. They consist of portraits, landscapes and architectural images and views of the Indian subcontinent by established photographers or studios such as Lala Deen Dayal, Jonston & Hoffman and Bourne & Shepherd.The glass plate negatives are primarily the work of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II or his studio \u2013 the tasveerkhana \u2013 and are wet collodion plates, which was the dominant technology in use from the 1850s\u20131880s. The bulk of the negatives in the collection are portraits, but they also include numerous landscapes of Jaipur and Amber and art objects such as paintings and sword hilts. The most distinctive part of the collection is the set of wet plate negatives that documents the zenana women, offering us a unique insight into the microcosm of the zenana.The photographic equipment in the collection belonged to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II and it appears to date from the 1860s. It includes the camera equipment and assorted accessories for practicing the wet plate collodion photography process.\n\n\n=== Transport gallery ===\nThis gallery features pre-motorised transport like buggies, palkis, miyana, raths, camel saddles, etc. It is currently closed for renovation.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRambagh Palace\nRaj Mahal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBindolass, Joe; Sarina Singh (2007).

          "this marvlous building depicits royalty of Indian Kings, it is located on a hilltop and you have a option to group by local jeep or by elephant ride which is amazing, entire fort is built with certain design to save it from intruders, light and sound show is also good to watch",
          "The excitement starts with the jeep ride up to the entrance to the courtyard. I am not sure why the line of vehicles continually stops along the narrow route. You will be bombarded by vendors. Our guide took our group (by foot) through the four palaces on the compound and",

          "Strongly recommend stop. We went upstairs and it took us only 15 min... everyone will ask you to take the jeep but I don\u2019t think is worth it unless you are fat or old. Place was amazing and it had lots of areas that you can get lost. Have fun",

          "This place is stunning. The place is huge and goes on for miles. You could spend forever here if wanted. Walk up is a good hike so wear good shoes. The architecture is insane. There is so much going on inside this Fort. The views go on for miles so take lots of photos. Glad",
          "My husband and I visited here in January 2020, the drive to the fort was impressive. Our driver gave us a brief history of the fort and then left us to explore. What a place! We walked around for an hour or so, I had the best chai tea here! Lots of people asked us for selfies!",
          "We visited Amer Fort for its artistic style elements. Entering the fort is by riding an elephant. The Fort is located on a hill. My Rider Mohammed was so happy and pleasant. His elephant, Monica did a great job. Amer Fort is a magnificent site with beautiful Mirror palace",

          "A very large fort in the old area of Jaipur. Our driver avoided the normal entrance where people were queuing for elephants for the ride up, and went round through the old town to the entrance where we could easily walk up a short climb and into the fort. The fort is huge, but",
          "Very good visit. Guide worthwhile. Chose to walk to Fort rather than take elephant ride, but the elephants are a sight themselves. The Fort has plenty to see if you know what you are looking at and easily fills 2 hours.",

          "The Amber Fort is a must see for anyone visiting Jaipur, and it requires a few hours to do the place any justice. The workmanship of the rooms in the noble areas is almost unimaginable.",
          "I think that every guide book lists this site as the main one to be sure to see, and I agree. It's also in a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but not expensive to get to.",
          "Think 'Frank' from the vicar of dibley and you will get our tour guide. Even through the sexism (after 20 mins the ladies head phones were off) you couldn't but be impressed with the fort. External wall 21km (I was listening) which you don't have to walk. The creativity of the",
          "It is rather big but contains a significant portion of the history in Jaipur. A lot of the original decorations are conserved/renovated so looks more beautiful than the forts in Agra/Delhi.",
          "It is a must if you visit Rajastan. It is a fairytale place. We did not have the elephant ride but if you have time it is also an interesting experience",
          "An impressive fortress built in 16th century with lots of empty chamber\u2019s dungeons servant quarters halls & enclosed gardens. It\u2019s possible to take elephant ride up to the palace but it seemed cruel to us so our taxi took us up. A great tour that you must see whilst I\u2019m Jaipur",

          "Straight out of Indiana Jones or Game of Thrones. I had no idea this kind of fortress existed in real life. Nothing in Europe, China or Japan holds a candle in comparison. Must see",
          "My life is far more complete now that I can say that I have written an elephant. It is kind of a cool novelty and doesn't really take that much time. The only reason I didn't give it five stars for fun is that we had come to expect there to be an entire Safari of elephants. When",
          "The sport would have been a whole lot more fun at who is more accessible the people who are over 25 years old. It's quite a jaunt to get there and for some may be worth it. For me, there were other attractions that are easier to get to and just as beautiful",

          "This is a fascinating fort area. A guide is essential to knowing what to look at and to understanding the history of the fort (for example the reason for marble window screens). There are very few informative signs here. There is much to see and learn at this site. The size",
          "We were very pleased with the history of the palace and got to know about it as we hired a guide(strongly recommend to hire a guide to know the historic importance). We liked the defence system, mini palaces of all 12 wives, king's secret passages and the Jodha Akbar locations.",
          "Amber fort or Amer Fort is a legendary place in all respects. A very well maintained property, clean and decorated. The elephant ride to the palace is the highlight. But to enjoy the elephant ride one needs to reach the place before 12 noon. Palace has 3 zones, Diwan-e-Aam,",

          "This site is best appreciated with a guide so you can understand its rich history. Please avoid the elephant rides. It is a difficult job for them and they literally get no rest, carting people up to its heights and then back down again. It is quite simply inhumane. If you get",

          "The site is absolutely stunning and of course you would enjoy wandering around on your own but I would highly recommend organising a guide to show you the areas you might miss and the information that makes the place even more mesmerising! Another tip - if you are travelling",
          "The visitor aware that the Rajputs, rulers of Rajastan, since the 1300s of the Christian era have been subdued by the Mughal emperors, perhaps will be surprised that, despite their submission, they managed to erect buildings as splendid as those of their rulers. In fact the",

          "Great place to experience Rajput architecture, however this place is not maintained well or does it bring back the vibe of the way of life of the Kings and queens. No other artifacts like the beds and clothing that would expect typically in a fort or palace, just the buildings.",
          "Would have been a 5 star review had it not been so much 'tout'ing around The palace is wonderful and very well maintained and takes at least 1:30 to 2 hours to cover. Too many guides start pestering you right from the car parking area! Take a Jeep ride than walk to the place",

        "wiki": "Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defense ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBuilt mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection.The fort was extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas.Until April 1944, the Jaipur State government used for its official purposes solar time read from the Samrat Yantra in the Jantar Mantar Observatory, with a gun fired from Nahargarh Fort as the time signal.\nSome scenes in the movies Rang De Basanti, Shuddh Desi Romance and Sonar Kella were shot at Nahargarh Fort.\nJaipur wax museum is yet another attraction was built on the left side at the entrance of Nahargarh fort in support with Department of Archaeology & Museums Jaipur, Department of Tourism, Government of Rajasthan, The place earlier was known as Vishram Ghar- Rest House for the soldiers and Shastragar-Artillery, Jaipur wax museum is a brainchild of Mr. Anoop Srivastava the founder Director and inaugurated on December 17, 2016 by Bollywood star Govinda, the wax museum has more than 35 wax and silicon statues from the field of sports, Bollywood, social activists, freedom fighters, Sawai Ram Singh,Maharaja Jai Singh, Madho Singhi, and Rajmata Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur along with first look-alike robotic tiger, replica of Khonoor Diamond is a recent attraction,The one of its own kind Sheesh Mahal, the palace of mirrors, a new landmark of Jaipur built in the adjoining building with 25 million glass pieces with thikri, mirror work and gold polish giving a magnificent royal look and feel.[1]\n\n\n== Visitation ==\nThe ticket for the historical fort of Nahargarh costs INR 50 for Indian nationals. For foreign tourists, the cost goes up to INR 200. Students enjoy discounted prices. For foreign students, the ticket costs INR 25, and INR 5 for Indian students\nNahargarh fort is open from 10 a.m. and the gates of the fort closes in the evening at 05.30 p.m. The visitors are not advised to stay any later than that because the fort is surrounded by dense deciduous forest. The forest is part of Nahargarh Biological Park and home to many wild animals.\n\n\n== Nearby Attractions ==\nKanak Vrindavan\nJantar Mantar\nJaigarh Fort\nAmer Fort\nCity Palace\nHawa Mahal\nJal Mahal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNahargarh Biological Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "Beautiful building, hosting a sculpture exhibition when we were there, also being lovingly restored. Cheaper and less busy than the Amber Fort, and you can take a lovely walk up/down to/from it from the edge of town. Recommended.",

          "To be clear, Amer Fort is the only fort to visit in Jaipur. This one is not so good but you can get some good pictures on the perimeter of this fort. Everything else is just zilch. Another thing, if you going here by cab, make sure you book it for return too. As getting back",
          "You'll love it when you see down from the top of Nahargarh fort. A view from the sunset point is fabulous. There's also Sheesh mahal, wax and durbar museum. They charge 500 INR for these three places. If you really want to view then try. yes it's costly. But I do not recommended",

          "The view of the city from this fort, is to die for. Smaller as compared to the Amber fort, but definitely worth visiting. There is a wax museum also inside the fort, separate charges for the entry. There are some restaurants inside as well as an open air food court, which is",
          "I actually wasn't super impressed with this one. I mean the views of the city are amazing for sure, but it wasn't very big, and I just wasn't interested in spending much time there. There was a weird \"display\" going on while I was there, and the place was annoyingly packed. We",

          "The fort in the periphery of Jaipur. Popular by the shooting of Rang De Basanti film. But the horrifying part is the pool filled with garbage (Same pool in which amir khan jumped in RDB). The best part is the bird eye view of pink city. Best time is visit this after you finish",
          "Another place where king lived with his queens. This palace gives one of the best bird eye view of the old and New Jaipur city. You can see Hawa Mahal, Amer fort, city palace, jheel mahal, almost all the sites from this fort. Do not forget to get local tour guide .",
          "There are many forts to be visited, but if you have to make a choice because of time constraints, Amber Fort is definitely the best. Jaigarh followed by Nahargarh deserve a visit only if you have enough time to spend in Jaipur.",

          "It's a long climb up from Amber Fort, and for that reason few people do it. However, with a bit of effort and mild fitness, the views are impressive. There's very little history to learn, so I'd not recommend paying for entry if you don't have a combined ticket with Amber Fort",
          "Pretty cool ride up to the fort....best view is during night.... couple of restaurants in the campus....had a really good time....nice piece of history too.... amazing architecture",
          "Definitely the most commercialised fort I visited in Jaipur. Which is sort of a shame as it takes away from the history of the fort. The views over the city are absolutely break taking though and well worth the visit and entry fee.",
          "The fort belongs to the Royal Family of Rajasthan. The fort hosts the biggest cannon on wheels, wich is never used for war purposes, but only once for a trial use. The caused damage was very big, so, they never tryed it again. As everywere in Rajasthan, the water storage is",

          "We got up there by tuktuk for the sunset and it was definitely worth it. There is the general entry fee of 200nrp which is ok. There seems to be another view point at the very end where you can get an even better view of Jaipur and where the sun sets. But this costs extra, can",
          "We avoided the additional wax museum and sheesh mahal so I can't speak to that but the overlooks on the perimeter off to the right near the ticket booth before you walk in towards the actual fort entry. Climb up and take a look at the breathtaking views! We didn't go for",
          "The wax museum and shesh mahal tour was very disappointing as it looked like a film studio. Not worth! The fort itself is a true beauty !",
          "Must see in Jaipur. You can go in TukTuk also. Gaint tank on the top of the fort was nice. Worth visiting and enjoy the chill during winter.",
          "Instead of taking an expensive taxi up the mountain, you can take a meter taxi to the foot of the mountain ( not 100% sure what the residential area is called). Its a very tedious climb but good excercise if you are up for it. Its about a 20 min walk up the narrow cobblestone",
          "Nahargarh fort is Huge but not maintained well. Most of the time you would feel that the artifacts placed in the rooms do not belong here (which they actually don't). There is not much to see inside the fort apart from admiring the architecture. However the view from the top of",

          "Other forts of Jaipur will not give you the city view which this fort provides. Although there is not much to see here as its a smaller fort but the best part is its location. Go when the sun is about to set, roam around and then enjoy the sun set view. There is also a small",
          "The fort has intrinsic interest itself. However i thought that the modern art display they had cthere conflicted with the historical image of the fort. If time is a constraint you may prefer to spend it on other forts.",
          "Decided to walk up to the fort, which really is a huge climb (once you find the badly signposted entrance). However, it's along way round by road. Some very impressive views from the top but not a lot to see inside. Some modern sculptures, which are of limited interest. Won't",

          "The fort is hard to reach, it has nothing unique; if you've visited City palace and Amer fort, this starts to feel like a drag. Worst part is how poorly this fort is maintained - the washrooms are in bad condition; the wax museum just outside the palace is very sad, and Sheesh",
          "We want to visit Nahargarh as it is the best place to watch the sunset over Jaipur, which it was. But we don't like that they let the palace ground to be an art exhibition. Many rooms were unavailable and those arts were not going the same way as it should be for the palace.",
          "Total letdown. There's just some useless modern art exhibit and a couple of food stalls. They allow vehicles into the premises which ends up in havoc. They honk constantly ruining the entire visit. I'd give it a rating of zero if I could.",

        "wiki": "The Jantar Mantar  is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations.The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system. The kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other.The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name jantar is derived from  yantra a Sanskrit word, meaning \"instrument, machine\", and mantar from mantrana also a  Sanskrit word \"consult, calculate\"). Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means 'calculating instrument'.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nJai Singh noticed that the Zij, which was used for determining the position of celestial objects, did not match the positions calculated on the table. He constructed five new observatories in different cities in order to create a more accurate Zij. The astronomical tables Jai Singh created, known as the Zij-i Muhammad Shahi, was continuously used in India for a century. However, the table had little significance outside of India also it was used to measure time.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several instruments had been built by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738. During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23.  Astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Jai Singh's main observatory, and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under Isvari Singh (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, Mado Singh (r. 1750-1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed, and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.\n\nRam Singh (r. 1835-1880) began the restoration of the Jantar Mantar, and completed restoring it in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more durable by inserting the lead into the lines in the instruments, and restoring some of the plaster instruments with stone instead. However, the observatory soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under Madho Singh II (r. 1880-1922) \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe observatory consists of nineteen instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking location of major stars as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides. The instruments are (alphabetical):\nChakra Yantra (four semicircular arcs on which a gnomon casts a shadow, thereby giving the declination of the Sun at four specified times of the day. This data corresponds to noon at four observatories around the world (Greenwich in UK, Zurich in Switzerland, Notke in Japan and Saitchen in the Pacific); this is equivalent of a wall of clocks registering local times in different parts of the world.)\nDakshin Bhitti Yantra (measures meridian, altitude and zenith distances of celestial bodies)\nDigamsha Yantra (a pillar in the middle of two concentric outer circles, used to measure azimuth of the sun, and to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset forecasts)\nDisha Yantra\nDhruva Darshak Pattika (observe and find the location of pole star with respect to other celestial bodies)\nJai Prakash Yantra (two hemispherical bowl-based sundial with marked marble slabs that map inverted image of sky and allows the observer to move inside the instrument, measures altitudes, azimuths, hour angles, and declinations)\nKapali Yantra (measures coordinates of celestial bodies in azimuth and equatorial systems, any point in sky can be visually transformed from one coordinate system to another)\nKanali Yantra\nKranti Vritta Yantra (measures longitude and latitude of celestial bodies)\nLaghu Samrat Yantra (the smaller sundial at the monument, inclined at 27 degrees, to measure time, less accurate than Vrihat Samrat Yantra)\nMisra Yantra (meaning mixed instrument, it is a compilation of five different instruments)\nNadi Valaya Yantra (two sundials on different faces of the instrument, the two faces represent north and south hemispheres, the accuracy of the instrument in measuring the time is less than a minute)\nPalbha Yantra\nRama Yantra (an upright building used to find the altitude and the azimuth of the sun)\nRashi Valaya Yantra (12 gnomon dials that measure ecliptic coordinates of stars, planets and all 12 constellation systems)\nShastansh Yantra (next to Vrihat Samrat Yantra, this instrument is a 60-degree arc built in the meridian plane within a dark chamber. At noon, the sun's pinhole image falls on a scale below enabling the observer to measure the zenith distance, declination, and the diameter of the Sun.)\nUnnatamsa Yantra (a metal ring divided into four segments by horizontal and vertical lines, with a hole in the middle; the position and orientation of the instrument allows measurement of the altitude of celestial bodies) \nVrihat Samrat Yantra (world's largest gnomon sundial, measures time in intervals of 2 seconds using shadow cast from the sunlight)\nYantra Raj Yantra (a 2.43-metre bronze astrolabe, one of the largest in the world, used only once a year, calculates the Hindu calendar) The Vrihat Samrat Yantra, which means the \"great king of instruments\", is 88 feet (27 m) high; its shadow tells the time of day. Its face is angled at 27 degrees, the latitude of Jaipur. The Hindu chhatri (small cupola) on top is used as a platform for announcing eclipses and the arrival of monsoons.\n\nThe instruments are in most cases huge structures. The scale to which they have been built has been alleged to increase their accuracy. However, the penumbra of the sun can be as wide as 30 mm, making the 1mm increments of the Samrat Yantra sundial devoid of any practical significance. Additionally, the masons constructing the instruments had insufficient experience with construction of this scale, and subsidence of the foundations has subsequently misaligned them. The samrat yantra, for instance, which is a sundial, can be used to tell the time to an accuracy of about two seconds in Jaipur local time. The Giant Sundial, known as the Samrat Yantra (The Supreme Instrument) is one of the world's largest sundials, standing 27 metres tall. Its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6 cm) every minute, which can be a profound experience to watch.\n\n\n=== Materials of construction ===\n\nBuilt from local stone and marble, each instrument carries an astronomical scale, generally marked on the marble inner lining. Bronze tablets, bricks and mortar were also employed in building the instruments in the monument spread over about 18,700 square metres. It was in continuous use until about 1800, then fell in disuse and disrepair. Restored again several times during the British colonial rule, particularly in 1902, the Jantar Mantar was declared a national monument in 1948. It was restored in 2006. The restoration process in early 20th century replaced some of the original materials of construction with different materials.Jantar Mantar is managed under the Archeological Sites and Monuments Act of Rajasthan since 1961, and protected as a National Monument of Rajasthan since 1968.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nThe Vedas mention astronomical terms, measurement of time and calendar, but do not mention any astronomical instruments. The earliest discussion of astronomical instruments, gnomon and clepsydra, is found in the Vedangas, ancient Sanskrit texts. The gnomon (called Shanku, \u0936\u0919\u094d\u0915\u0941) found at Jantar Mantar monument is discussed in these 1st millennium BCE Vedangas and in many later texts such as the Katyayana Sulbasutras. Other discussions of astronomical instruments are found in Hinduism texts such as the 4th century BCE Arthashastra, Buddhist texts such as Sardulakarna-avadana, and Jainism texts such as Surya-prajnapti. The theories behind the instruments are found in texts by the 5th century CE Aryabhatta, 6th century CE Brahmagupta and Varahamihira, 9th century Lalla, 11th century Sripati and Bhaskara. The texts of Bhaskara have dedicated chapters on instruments and he calls them Yantra-adhyaya.The theory of chakra-yantra, yasti-yantra, dhanur-yantra, kapala-yantra, nadivalaya-yantra, kartari-yantra, and others are found in the ancient texts.\n\n\n== The telescope in India ==\nAlthough Jai Singh's observatories did not use telescopes, Jai Singh himself had several which he occasionally used for his observations, and telescopes were being built in India at the time. However, telescopes built at the time were not very accurate for measuring celestial objects. In Europe, the telescope sights were first being used, and increased the accuracy of measuring celestial objects. However, the telescope sight was still a new invention in Europe, and had not yet reached India, and European innovations in Astronomy were only slightly more accurate than the medieval Hindu instruments that Jai Singh had created.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nIt was used as a filming location for the 2006 film The Fall as a maze.\nStorm Thorgerson photographed the sundial for the cover of Shpongle's DVD, Live at the Roundhouse 2008.It was photographed by Julio Cort\u00e1zar with the collaboration of Antonio G\u00e1lvez for the book Prosa del Observatorio (Editorial Lumen: Barcelona, 1972).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJantar Mantar\nYantra\nMantra\nTantra\nGyarah Sidi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSharma, Virendra Nath and Aditya Sharma (1995).

          "We loved Jaipur but felt very ripped off by this place. We paid 20,000 rupee each and had to have a guide to wonder around a couple of rooms and then visit 3 shops. I would never go again and since it was twice as much as the Taj Mahal represented really poor value.",
          "A huge palace in the Jaipur city. A guide gives you a good amount of detail on the palace. But you can still visit the palace without a guide. A small puppet shop is located near the exit of the palace. They perform on request. Try it if you are interested.",
          "A very expensive entrance fee, compared to other places of interest . Worth going to see with a guide. We went early to avoid the crowds. I found the guest suite fascinating with British Royal memorabilia.20,000 entrance was too much, compared to what we experienced at the",
          "I used audio guide to see the two plazas and various museum exhibits. Was ok but not spectacular. Did not pay high price to enter palace.",
          "Went there twice. Entrance was INR700/pax exclude private royal quarters. Do visit perhaps towards late afternoon to avoid group tourists as you can take pictures. A living palace with the current Maharajah royal family still reside here. Royal restaurant, an AirBnB Royal Suite",
          "Nothing special about the city palace. Entry fee of Rs. 200 is too high. Only some portion of city palace is available for tourists.",
          "Its a grand but an expensive affair to visit this attraction. Located at just a walking distance from Jantar mantar, this place has an entry fee of 200 Rs for Indian tourists. Guide charges are heavy at around 400 Rs. However, a guide is necessary to visit this place which",
          "Visited here and really liked it. Plenty to see. Lovely architecture. Plenty of history attached to the place. It has the two biggest solid silver bowls on earth. This place is well worth a visit.",
          "We spent probably around 2.5 hours there with a guy that charged us 500 rupees to explain us the whole thing (we were 10 people). There are cool things to know but others are just meh. Overall quite nice stop",
          "The palace is beautiful. In addition to visit to different parts of the palace, fully guided tour takes tourists to the blue room, room with mirrors and the room where the royals to this day celebrate Diwali, they are all breathtakingly beautiful. The tour ends with a nice cup",
          "Visiting and enjoying the City Palace Museum is a must. It is a palace complex with courtyards, pavilions & gardens. The palace was built between 1729 and 1732 by the ruler of Amber Sawai Jai Singh II. It became museum in 1959. There are stunning gates with ornate designs and",
          "A large old palace in the town of Jaipur. There is a lot to see and it takes a couple of hours at least. Well worth a visit, but lots of tourists including many locals.",
          "A beutiful, intricate and extremely colourful palace in the heart of the madness of Jaipur. Well worth a visit!!!",
          "This is a beautiful palace area with much to see. Especially interesting we\u2019re the armory and textile/clothing exhibits inside. Unfortunately, no photos are allowed as there are very interesting exhibits and some of the armory exhibits are unlike any we\u2019ve seen anywhere else in",
          "We lucked out and got a wonderful tour guide at the palace (they go on a rotation basis). He really made the tour worthwhile. We did the full tour and paid the higher price for that. Going in the mid-afternoon helped avoid the crowds. It's definitely not as impressive as Mysore",
          "Nice and beautiful place Jaipur is very famous because of old pink city. People are so friendly and City palace beautiful palace old handicraft. Museum story of king amazing..",
          "We spent an interesting hour or so wandering through the courtyards and museums of the palace. It is still lived in and the one large and one small flags signified that royalty was in residence. Historic paintings showing the lineage, along with polo artifacts and a number of",
          "To me not worth a visit. I don't see what the fuss is about this building. Rather spend time in the market near-by",
          "Hoards of tourists came into the buildings and every Insta princess in Asia seemed to be there posing selfishly for entire epochs in front of the highlights. It's expensive to visit as a \"foreigner\". There are three rooms with things you can see, textiles, the arsenal and the",
          "This is another must for Jaipur. Easy to get around and extremely interesting. Some awesome things to see. Take an hour or so.",
          "The place is ok. Besides the architecture, there isn\u2019t not so much to see there. I think it isn\u2019t a must seen place.",
          "Very good ,i paid 1500/- but worth it if u really want to see royal palace otherwise 200/- ticket for just museum",
          "As Jaipur was only the city we visited in the state of Rajasthan and City Palace was the only palace in Jaipur, we paid the exorbitant ticket price of INR3,500 per person. There are other tickets sold at a lower price range but we read about the beautiful blue room in the palace",
          "The palace is amazing the only worst thing there is the shops in the palace when we take a guide they take us to the shops. Dont buy anything there they just loot the people in the name of maharaja and tells you every thing that outside these all things might be fake and they",
          "A visit to this beautiful palace has been on my to do list for a long time. This is probably the last time I will be in Jaipur. The basic ticket is called a 'composite' ticket and to see the genuinely beautiful apartments you have to pay extra. Basic ticket is 3,500 INR.",
          "It's the palace of the royal family of Jaipur. Current royal family also staying near the palace. You can see and know about the rulers and there favourite possessions. It's having paid entrance.",
          "When compared to the entry fee pricing, the palace is not so much worthy. But you can visit the palace for its architecture and historical monuments. The museums dont allow you for pictures. If short of time, then this place can be skipped",
          "Well worth a visit. Not only is it an Indian Palace (another one!), but it is claimed still to be occupied in parts and at times. There is a lot of family history on display in the museums. There is a choice of eating places on hand as well. Not too crowded and you can find",
          "Magnificent views of Royal past. Easy access from city. Tickets are priced at Rs. 1500/-., which seems costly.",
          "Nice and interesting visit. Not as amazing as the Udaipur city palace in my opinion, but definitely worth a visit. Also, it is still a residence of the current prince.",
          "There are different types of tours you can take to see this palace but I recommend paying the money and taking the full royal tour because it takes you inside the palace and through many of the fabulously decorated rooms. We are not big tour guide people, mostly preferring to do",
          "We enjoyed our time at City Palace. The historical artifacts housed there do a great job of telling the history of the area. There are people dressed up in historical attire that are more than willing to take pictures with you, but they don't do it for free, they want a tip.",
          "Nice Palace for a visit. Not spectacular but worth a short visit. See some areas and Royal costumes.",
          "Definite must visit while in Jaipur. And I would actually recommend paying the additional amount to view the special rooms in the palace. Fantastic...the guide comes for free, but be wary of the end of your pitch to buy stuff from the nearby shops - that's one big scam.",
          "200 ticket price for palace view bit on higher side. worth a visit though. old paintings and attire worn by kings are displayed in mueseum",
          "The first thing that strikes you when you enter the City Palace Complex is how dirty the approach roads are. Cleanliness and Proper house keeping is given a go-by. With thousands of pigeons located right outside the Palace gates, the stench can be over powering. The INR 3000 +",
          "Touring the Jaipur City Palace was an optional tour of our tour group. We chose to attend all of the optional tours (except the dinners) because we might not attend those cities / sites again in the future. We are not disappointed with the City Palace, however, we did not pay",

          "We first visited Jantar Mantar and then came to City Palace. We were not sure whether to see just the museum or take their Royal Grandeur tour. We decided to take their Royal Grandeur tour which included local guide (English), refreshments, visit to the private rooms of the",
          "A wander through this important part of Jaipur and a famous landmark. I look at how the others lives in the distant past. A must when in Jaipur",
          "The palace is worth a visit if you want to have a look into what an actual Indian palace looks like, however a guide is included in the expensive entrance fee and he makes sure that tourists don\u2019t want off to restricted areas.",
          "The entrance ticket for the splendour tour for tourists may sound exorbitant,at 3500inr but it is definitely worth doing. I took my time and spent two and half hours at this palace. The architecture , a blend of mughal and rajesthani ,boasts of grandeur and opulence . My",

          "The City Palace of Jaipur is gorgeous and it\u2019s been very well maintained. I much preferred it to the one in Udaipur. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit and it\u2019s nice to stroll through and imbibe the deep heritage of Rajasthan!",
          "A must visit place if you are a person who likes history. What a fantastic place. One observation, these buildings and properties inside lacks proactive maintenance.",
          "Firstly you have to be very cautious in terms of buying the tickets. There are two options: firstly ticket only for museum which is close to 400 INR and second for the palace which is worth 1500 INR. We were confused because the online rates for tickets were much lower. We",

          "Certainly not the most impressive palace you can visit in Rajasthan, but well worth the visit anyway. The portraits of the kings over a step back in time, the large silver containers are the biggest you\u2019ve seen and there are some nice picture opportunities. Beware of the guards",
          "It is one of the beautiful mahal of Jaipur that we liked . One should visit here if they are in Jaipur it is worth visiting here . The architecture of this mahal is very beautiful . And it is well maintained and clean .",
          "We got suckered into paying the 3500 rupees per head for the \u2018grand tour\u2019. Some nice stuff, no doubt but hardly worth the money. I would have paid 1000 rupees top. This is a private palace, not associated with the city at all. Essentially this place is a money making racket",
          "Probably seen enough palaces this trip, so the most modern one can be hard to impress, having theme based rooms was a good way to understand the life of the maharaja, the photographs were really insightful, the modern aspects of architecture were impressive, with chandeliers and",

          "Definitely recommend getting the most comprehensive ticket package because seeing the inside of the palace is worth it, as is the included tour guide. Otherwise, you'll enjoy the outside pink/orange of the buildings but you will not learn about the arhictecture or history.",

          "The city palace is close to Tripolia bazar near Jantar Mantar and hence you can part the vehicle in the palace parking area and visit both the places by covering by foot. The city palace is having lot of museums and viewing galleries and if one is interested in history then you",

          "Disgusting thieves manage by a bunch of old farts, corrupted. They charge you 700 and then to see the palace inside they order you to pay and extra 3500. Nothing worth watching. Save your money!",
          "We had a short amount of time in Jaipur and wish we didn\u2019t use any of it here. I found it overpriced and just got bothered by workers for photos and tips the whole time. The famous peacock gate etc are good for a picture, but the pictures we got at Amber Fort and other places in",
          "I visited City Palace in Jaipur recently , after a gap of about 12 years, and was totally disappointed. The plus point of this tourist attraction is that , in the Old City , it is the only place where adequate parking is available.That is about the only plus. The price of",

          "In a city with so much to see the City Palace was a bit of a disappointment, basically only two courtyards unless you pay an extra 3,500 to see the private rooms. The palace is not included in the ticket that allows you to visit a number of sites in two days. Although 700 rupees",
          "Nice and beautiful palace,The beautiful palace was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh during his reign. Among the various forts and palaces of Jaipur, City Palace stands apart,art is loocking so good",
          "I\u2019ve given this 3 rather than 2 stars because there were actually good things to see in the palace, as well as it being quite pretty. My reason for marking down are that for the price it is expensive/poor value for money, especially compared to udaipur\u2019s city palace which is",
          "I really like the architectural work of the City Palace. Very beautiful and I enjoye dmy shopping inside as well. The only thing I am curious about is what happens to the entry fees paid. Reason I am saying this as because there are King's families still staying in the palace so",
          "Amber fort was first in our plan in Jaipur tour. We took a private taxi to go there. The view of the fort both from outside and inside was fantastic. The approach road is too narrow and dirty. Howevwer, the fort is maintained reasonably well. There are lot of people offering",
          "I had visited City palace years ago. And visited now this September. I was shocked to see how many shops, restaurant, bar etc are opened in this premises. The whole thing is reduced to one tiny building. I wonder why they charge do much entry fee, if one has to see written, \"",
          "Way over priced in my opinion. 700 rupees for the cheapest ticket and going up to 3500!! It was just another palace area to look around. We couldn't enter many of the rooms with our ticket. They have an art workshop in one area where the man was very rude to us because we didn't",
          "We did the museum which is well worth a visit as there was so much to see. There is an option to visit the Palace rooms but this was very expensive and from what I read not really worth it. Give yourself a few hours if you want to see it all.",
          "There is no need to go here. All the shops sell the same trash as on the street and they are 700 rupees cheaper. It\u2019s honestly one large excuse to sponge another rupee out of unwitting tourists. There is a couple silver bowls and 4 doors that\u2019s all.. The 3500 tour is of the",

          "Our guide convinced us to buy the 3500 rupees ticket by saying it would be totally worth it. With this ticket you can enter a private part of the palace (in which you cannot even take photos) and in a couple of decorated rooms. Nice rooms, but nothing new if you have already",
          "Overall I was disappointed I felt for the cost it was not worth it and would have preferred to see other sites which were alot cheaper such as the Amber Fort",
          "The entry tickets to city palace is 3000/- for complete tour. I feel that is too much for an Indian tourist. The palace is big and we decided to avoid it due to heavy entry charges.",

          "Its a very beautiful place especially with pink colour. The place divided into three part, one the museum, one the palace, and one where the maharaj lived. We can only visit the museum and the palace. At the museum side you can find a lot of historical things from jaipur and",

There is also a museum housing outfits",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Jantar Mantar  is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations.The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system. The kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other.The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name jantar is derived from  yantra a Sanskrit word, meaning \"instrument, machine\", and mantar from mantrana also a  Sanskrit word \"consult, calculate\"). Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means 'calculating instrument'.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nJai Singh noticed that the Zij, which was used for determining the position of celestial objects, did not match the positions calculated on the table. He constructed five new observatories in different cities in order to create a more accurate Zij. The astronomical tables Jai Singh created, known as the Zij-i Muhammad Shahi, was continuously used in India for a century. However, the table had little significance outside of India also it was used to measure time.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several instruments had been built by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738. During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23.  Astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Jai Singh's main observatory, and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under Isvari Singh (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, Mado Singh (r. 1750-1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed, and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.\n\nRam Singh (r. 1835-1880) began the restoration of the Jantar Mantar, and completed restoring it in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more durable by inserting the lead into the lines in the instruments, and restoring some of the plaster instruments with stone instead. However, the observatory soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under Madho Singh II (r. 1880-1922) \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe observatory consists of nineteen instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking location of major stars as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides. The instruments are (alphabetical):\nChakra Yantra (four semicircular arcs on which a gnomon casts a shadow, thereby giving the declination of the Sun at four specified times of the day. This data corresponds to noon at four observatories around the world (Greenwich in UK, Zurich in Switzerland, Notke in Japan and Saitchen in the Pacific); this is equivalent of a wall of clocks registering local times in different parts of the world.)\nDakshin Bhitti Yantra (measures meridian, altitude and zenith distances of celestial bodies)\nDigamsha Yantra (a pillar in the middle of two concentric outer circles, used to measure azimuth of the sun, and to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset forecasts)\nDisha Yantra\nDhruva Darshak Pattika (observe and find the location of pole star with respect to other celestial bodies)\nJai Prakash Yantra (two hemispherical bowl-based sundial with marked marble slabs that map inverted image of sky and allows the observer to move inside the instrument, measures altitudes, azimuths, hour angles, and declinations)\nKapali Yantra (measures coordinates of celestial bodies in azimuth and equatorial systems, any point in sky can be visually transformed from one coordinate system to another)\nKanali Yantra\nKranti Vritta Yantra (measures longitude and latitude of celestial bodies)\nLaghu Samrat Yantra (the smaller sundial at the monument, inclined at 27 degrees, to measure time, less accurate than Vrihat Samrat Yantra)\nMisra Yantra (meaning mixed instrument, it is a compilation of five different instruments)\nNadi Valaya Yantra (two sundials on different faces of the instrument, the two faces represent north and south hemispheres, the accuracy of the instrument in measuring the time is less than a minute)\nPalbha Yantra\nRama Yantra (an upright building used to find the altitude and the azimuth of the sun)\nRashi Valaya Yantra (12 gnomon dials that measure ecliptic coordinates of stars, planets and all 12 constellation systems)\nShastansh Yantra (next to Vrihat Samrat Yantra, this instrument is a 60-degree arc built in the meridian plane within a dark chamber. At noon, the sun's pinhole image falls on a scale below enabling the observer to measure the zenith distance, declination, and the diameter of the Sun.)\nUnnatamsa Yantra (a metal ring divided into four segments by horizontal and vertical lines, with a hole in the middle; the position and orientation of the instrument allows measurement of the altitude of celestial bodies) \nVrihat Samrat Yantra (world's largest gnomon sundial, measures time in intervals of 2 seconds using shadow cast from the sunlight)\nYantra Raj Yantra (a 2.43-metre bronze astrolabe, one of the largest in the world, used only once a year, calculates the Hindu calendar) The Vrihat Samrat Yantra, which means the \"great king of instruments\", is 88 feet (27 m) high; its shadow tells the time of day. Its face is angled at 27 degrees, the latitude of Jaipur. The Hindu chhatri (small cupola) on top is used as a platform for announcing eclipses and the arrival of monsoons.\n\nThe instruments are in most cases huge structures. The scale to which they have been built has been alleged to increase their accuracy. However, the penumbra of the sun can be as wide as 30 mm, making the 1mm increments of the Samrat Yantra sundial devoid of any practical significance. Additionally, the masons constructing the instruments had insufficient experience with construction of this scale, and subsidence of the foundations has subsequently misaligned them. The samrat yantra, for instance, which is a sundial, can be used to tell the time to an accuracy of about two seconds in Jaipur local time. The Giant Sundial, known as the Samrat Yantra (The Supreme Instrument) is one of the world's largest sundials, standing 27 metres tall. Its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6 cm) every minute, which can be a profound experience to watch.\n\n\n=== Materials of construction ===\n\nBuilt from local stone and marble, each instrument carries an astronomical scale, generally marked on the marble inner lining. Bronze tablets, bricks and mortar were also employed in building the instruments in the monument spread over about 18,700 square metres. It was in continuous use until about 1800, then fell in disuse and disrepair. Restored again several times during the British colonial rule, particularly in 1902, the Jantar Mantar was declared a national monument in 1948. It was restored in 2006. The restoration process in early 20th century replaced some of the original materials of construction with different materials.Jantar Mantar is managed under the Archeological Sites and Monuments Act of Rajasthan since 1961, and protected as a National Monument of Rajasthan since 1968.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nThe Vedas mention astronomical terms, measurement of time and calendar, but do not mention any astronomical instruments. The earliest discussion of astronomical instruments, gnomon and clepsydra, is found in the Vedangas, ancient Sanskrit texts. The gnomon (called Shanku, \u0936\u0919\u094d\u0915\u0941) found at Jantar Mantar monument is discussed in these 1st millennium BCE Vedangas and in many later texts such as the Katyayana Sulbasutras. Other discussions of astronomical instruments are found in Hinduism texts such as the 4th century BCE Arthashastra, Buddhist texts such as Sardulakarna-avadana, and Jainism texts such as Surya-prajnapti. The theories behind the instruments are found in texts by the 5th century CE Aryabhatta, 6th century CE Brahmagupta and Varahamihira, 9th century Lalla, 11th century Sripati and Bhaskara. The texts of Bhaskara have dedicated chapters on instruments and he calls them Yantra-adhyaya.The theory of chakra-yantra, yasti-yantra, dhanur-yantra, kapala-yantra, nadivalaya-yantra, kartari-yantra, and others are found in the ancient texts.\n\n\n== The telescope in India ==\nAlthough Jai Singh's observatories did not use telescopes, Jai Singh himself had several which he occasionally used for his observations, and telescopes were being built in India at the time. However, telescopes built at the time were not very accurate for measuring celestial objects. In Europe, the telescope sights were first being used, and increased the accuracy of measuring celestial objects. However, the telescope sight was still a new invention in Europe, and had not yet reached India, and European innovations in Astronomy were only slightly more accurate than the medieval Hindu instruments that Jai Singh had created.\n\n\n== Filming location ==\nIt was used as a filming location for the 2006 film The Fall as a maze.\nStorm Thorgerson photographed the sundial for the cover of Shpongle's DVD, Live at the Roundhouse 2008.It was photographed by Julio Cort\u00e1zar with the collaboration of Antonio G\u00e1lvez for the book Prosa del Observatorio (Editorial Lumen: Barcelona, 1972).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJantar Mantar\nYantra\nMantra\nTantra\nGyarah Sidi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSharma, Virendra Nath and Aditya Sharma (1995).

      "name": "Hawa Mahal",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Hawa Mahal (English translation: \"The Palace of Winds\" or \"The Palace of Breeze\") is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.\nThe structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.  It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of \"purdah\", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but in reality it is the back of that structure.In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568  million. The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it.\nThe palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modeled hanging cornices.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique fa\u00e7ade. The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the Mahal has been described as \"having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard\".Lal Chand Ustad was the architect of this unique structure. Built-in red and pink colored sandstone, in keeping with the d\u00e9cor of the other monuments in the city, its color is a full testimony to the epithet of \"Pink City\" given to Jaipur. Its fa\u00e7ade depicting 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas (some are made of wood) is a stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the structure. Its cultural and architectural heritage is a true reflection of a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and  Islamic Mughal architecture; the Rajput style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars, lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic style as evident in its stone inlay filigree work and arches (as distinguished from its similarity with the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri).The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard.Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'\u0153uvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his favourite resort because of the elegance and built-in interior of the Mahal. The cooling effect in the chambers, provided by the breeze passing through the small windows of the fa\u00e7ade, was enhanced by the fountains provided at the center of each of the chambers.The top two floors of the Hawa Mahal are accessed only through ramps. The Mahal is maintained by the archaeological department of the Government of Rajasthan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nTillotson, G.H.R (1987).

          "Hawa Mahal is a must see in Jaipur, but be ready to be packed in to get a view from its highest point. It you want an equally spectacular view and still be close to Hawa Mahal, enjoy dinner and a drink across the road at the Tattoo Cafe and Lounge.",
          "This is a very beautiful and worth watching Palace in Rajastan, incredible handmade work by craftsmen of exceptional finesse and richness",
          "Spectacular view had a great time with family. Architecture of the place is amazing but being in city it was a long journey.",
          "On our city tour we stopped to admire this icon of Jaipur. In our four day stay we seemed to always be driving by. It does not disappoint.",
          "It's a good place to click photo. Not recommend to go inside and waste time. You can try the local food they provide near to mall. Spend more time at jantar mandatharam instead",
          "Nice Palace where the royals used to peep from to see their ordinary subjects. Lovely 5 storey building.",
          "Don't quite know what the whole hype really is about this place....just another structure on the road. In fact, if the driver doesn't tell you, chances are you will not even notice it.",
          "It is a nice historic site attached to the Hawa Mahal Road. You should start by clicking pictures from across the street. Once done cross the street again, you have to go around the property to buy entry ticket. It costs Rs. 50 per person. You can also opt for audio guide by",
          "Beautiful building located on a busy street with difficult access, limited parking. Worth stopping to get a picture. Many shops in the area with Indian products - shoes dresses foods",
          "It is a real hawa Mahal as it is look like standing in the sky as it is very high .It's design is amazing .i loved it",
          "Very beautiful place but very poorly maintained. We visited at a time when it was the peak season time for travel. This could have made things worse for us, the place is not well run, people are not very nice. The staff and security who are supposed to help you do not care.",
          "The iconic image of Jaipur. Even from the outside it is impressive. Looks great in the evening. A great shopping strip as well",
          "Not sure why this site / building is must see in Jaipur. At least the exterior of the building has an interesting/unusual structure but interior it is nothing special. Just space and stairs, packed with Indian visitors.",
          "We visited Hawa Mahal with a lot of hope and anticipation. The first let-down was the one, single-window and long queue/wait of nearly 40 minutes to buy entry-tickets. The beautiful frontage/courtyard has been defiled by vendors, eateries and shops. There are no guides readily",
          "For those of us who have grown up learning about Hawa Mahal with the picture of its iconic facade, the reality is a bit underwhelming. The facade, though, is a beautiful sight at night when it is lit up in its full glory. The narrow passageways tend to result in \u201cpedestrian",
          "It's right on a road side, which is a very busy street. Extremely worthless ticket fare as well. Price should reduce.",
          "The balcony is beautiful from both sides. You need to visit inside to see the balcony and get the view the royal ladies had of the festivities from here. There\u2019s also a small collection of statues celebrating music and dance. From the windows you get far vistas of Jaipur too.",
          "It is not able to took pic ...situated in main road ...not able to cover the area picture ...it is situated in busy street....",
          "What an interesting and historical building. Built for the many wives of the Maharaja, so that they could all look out onto the street, without being seen themselves",
          "The palace of the winds is highly touted in guide books. It is nice but a single portion of the palace in a somewhat run down portion of the old city. It is really only a facade and about a ten minute stop. If you are in Jaipur it is worth seeing but I would not go there just to",
          "Hard to believe the Palace of the Winds sits on a busy street in Jaipur. Impressive Structure with amazing beauty. Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana,",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful palace... but the beauty is only from outside. Make sure you carry a selfie stick for a full photo view. The best time to visit is dusk. Pictures during day and night are totally different.",
          "That visible building that looks enormous, it is really not real. But it is a tourist destination. Thousands, if not millions flock here to see this place. There are many things to see in Jaipur. This is a must see. The place is declared by UNESCO as world heritage site. The",

          "Hawa Mahal must be one of the signature places when you talk about Jaipur. Do not think that you would ever want to miss Hawa Mahal. The palace is like a Jharoka for the erstwhile ladies of the royal family to see the proceedings on the road. Even now the busy main road with",
          "Since years of years hawa mahal is situated in chandpole Jaipur Rajasthan India . Great place for visiters.",
          "The fort has interesting history. However, it is prettier to look from outside than inside. I assume in summer it is more fascinating since it keeps the rooms cold. In general most of it seems to need reconstruction.",
          "Hawa Mahal, is palace of winds in walled city of Jaipur. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953",

          "Dusty, dirty, noisy street full of begging children. Interesting architecture but not renovated at all.",

          "This would be the first place I\u2019d recommend to see in Jaipur. This spectacular architecture literally takes breaths away!",
          "Situated at Pink City of Jaipur, Hawa Mahal was built in 1799. It has approximately 955 windows on the outside walls. The honeycomb shaped and beautifully carved windows allow breeze to blow through the palace and makes it a perfect summer palace. Exterior is richly decorated,",
          "The Palace of Wind has a magnificent facade which is best viewed from a distance - although the best place is the adjacent main road and busy market. This facade was built to allow the women of the royal court to watch (from the many windows) parades and other outdoor events in",
          "Most of the day tour operators wouldn't take you inside hawa mahal. But I would recommend to visit it from inside. It's worth it. Especially to see how the walls and windows are designed. Actually these designs can be used in modern structures to provide ventilation. Also the",
          "The structure, as you might have already seen in photos, is magnificent. However it's actual appearance is so so shabby and disappointing!! Covered with multiple layers of dust and with not even slightest sign of maintainance it's a pity that Government is not taking any action",
          "Hawa Mahal or \"The Palace of Winds\" in English was a palace of the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh of Jaipur and included quarters for ladies, which is the most notable part of the palace. The facade is a very distinctive multi-storey windows of intricate lattice work that extends",

          "Do not skip visiting it from inside. Well maintained. A note: box office is hardly visible, and do count your money. I think it is always good to have exact cash",

          "The facade of this building is incredible with all of its intircate detail. It was so amazing we saw it twice. Well worth a look, even if you can't go inside and have to put up with the pushy touts at the street bazaar that runs outside it.",

          "The building is nice but the cost of the entrance is between 2000 and 3500 rupees. The museums are an additional 700rupees. Since this is the main attraction of Jaipur they take advantage of it.",

          "The best time to visit is early morning as this place is always packed with tourists. Being on the main road it's packed. The architecture of it was very beautiful and intricate. The inside of the Mahal is nice. Although people say it's not worth going inside but I went inside",
          "We didn't go inside only drove by, but what a stunning building. Not just in the day time, looks stunning on a night.",

        "wiki": "Jal Mahal (meaning \"Water Palace\") is a palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city, the capital of the state of Rajasthan, India. The palace and the lake around it were renovated and enlarged in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber.\n\n\n== The Palace ==\n\nThe Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a grand scale. The building has a picturesque view of the lake itself but owing to its seclusion from land is equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the surrounding Nahargarh (\"tiger-abode\") hills. The palace, built-in red sandstone, is a five storied building, of which four floors remain underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is exposed. One rectangular Chhatri on the roof is of the Bengal type. The chhatris on the four corners are octagonal. The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage (plasterwork and wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of waterlogging, which have been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin layer of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the project area have also been used for constructing buildings. From the northeast, the Kanak Vrindavan valley, where a temple complex sits, the hills slope gently towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up of a thick mantle of soil, blown sand, and alluvium. Forest denudation, particularly in the hilly areas, has caused soil erosion, compounded by wind and water action. As a result, silt built up in the lake incrementally raises the lake bed.\nOn the terrace of the palace, a garden was built with arched passages. At each corner of this palace semi-octagonal towers were built with an elegant cupola.The restoration works of the early 2000s were not satisfactory and an expert in the field of similar architectural restoration works of Rajasthan palaces carefully examined the designs that could decipher the originally existing designs on the walls, after removing the recent plasterwork. Based on this finding, restoration works were re-done with traditional materials for plastering \u2013 the plaster consists of partly organic material: a mortar mix of lime, sand and surkhi mixed with jaggery, guggal and methi powder. It was also noticed that there was hardly any water seepage, except for a little dampness, on the floors below the water level. But the original garden, which existed on the terrace had been lost. Now, a new terrace is being created based on a similar roof garden of the Amer Palace.  The building is located near the shoreline of a lake with a maximum depth of 15 ft.  Though 4 stories of the building are under the surface of the water, they would be built into the bed of the lake.\n\n\n=== The Royal family chhatris and cenotaphs ===\nAt Gaitore opposite the lake are chhatris and cenotaphs erected over cremation platforms of some of the Kachwaha rulers of Jaipur. They were built by Jai Singh II within landscaped gardens. The cenotaphs are in honor of Pratap Singh, Madho Singh II and Jai Singh II among others. Jai Singh II's cenotaph is made of marble and has impressive intricate carvings. It has a dome with 20 carved pillars.\n\n\n== Restoration works ==\nIn 2004, the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation took matters in its hands and decided to try and restore the monument to its original glory. They signed an agreement with Jal Mahal Resorts, granting it a 99-year lease to develop 100 acres along the Man Sagar Lake (in the middle of which Jal Mahal stands) and the palace. The 99-year lease was given out to a business tycoon, Navratan Kothari. For the past 9 years, he has worked on the cleaning of the lake and restoration of the Palace. Now there are many inhabitants of the area and it has created a great job opportunity for the people of Jaipur and Rajasthan. For the future, Navratan plans to build a few hotels around the Jal Mahal and make it a very popular tourist destination.\n\n\n=== Joint sector project ===\n\nThe Lake restoration project of the Man Sagar Lake area with an estimated investment of Rs1.5 billion (considered as one of the largest and unique such projects in India) has evolved a plan that has diverse project components. Consequently, there are many project stakeholders and beneficiaries. The project stake holders are: the Government of Rajasthan and their subordinate organizations such as the Public Works Department (PWD), Rajasthan Urban Development Authority (RUIDP), the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA \u2013 the nodal agency for implementation of all aspects of the project), the Department of Tourism, Rajasthan Project Development Fund (RPDF) and the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) and an Empowered Committee on Infrastructure Development (ECID); the Central Government organizations associated for planning and financing are the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOE&F) through its National River Conservation Program (NRCP) and ILFS.The Private Sector Developer (PSD) appointed was M/s KGK Consortium. Under the public-private sector partnership model approved by the EICD, PDCOR had prepared the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the restoration of Man Sagar Lake, Jal Mahal restoration and lake precincts development. The total project area for restoration and development approved by ECID was 432 acres (175 ha) comprising the lake with 300 acres (120 ha) water spread, the lake precincts area of 100 acres (40 ha), which subsumed 15 acres (6.1 ha) of submerged land) for tourism development under joint sector cooperation and 32 acres (13 ha) for lake promenade and tertiary treatment facility and related works.The studies indicated two approaches to tackle the environmental degradation that had occurred in the lake, namely,  dealing with natural catchment area and concurrently addressing the serious problem of municipal sewerage emerging from large scale urbanization or human settlement. Keeping this broad planning approach in view, under the lake restoration project, the works undertaken involved were: the re-alignment of city drains, de-silting of the lake, construction of artery road from Amber to Man Sagar Dam (about 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi)), construction of check dam in a 100 metres (330 ft) length with silt removed from the lake, creation of three nesting islands for migratory birds, lakefront promenade in1 kilometre (0.62 mi)), afforestation and treatment of forest area portion of lake catchment, plantation to stabilise the slopes of bank formation. Afforestation envisaged plantation of local plant species such as Acacia arabica (desi babool) and\nTamarix indica (planting close to the water edge where they can grow well), Terminalia arjuna (Arjun) poplar, neem and all species of Ficus, which would provide diversity in vegetation and also better habitat diversity for feeding by birds and wildlife.In addition, to remove eutrophication of the lake water and improve its water quality, in-situ Bioremediation process with 140 diffusers & 5 air compressors to aerate and create an inversion of the lake bed and stored water was also envisaged. The city sewage, which supplied 7.0 MLD of untreated sewage was treated with Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) and then led to the lake to maintain its water level, after due removal of nutrients through tertiary treatment. This process involved diversion of the Brahampuri Nala into the Nagtalai Nala by a lined channel to its south. This was then lead through a treatment plant on site to generate secondary level effluent, which was then discharged into an artificial wetland through a hyacinth channel. For this purpose, a Physico Chemical Treatment Plant was also envisaged and the effluent from this plant was taken through artificially created wetlands in an area of 4 hectares (9.9 acres)) (not only to treat the water but also to serve as natural habitat for birds) and through this process the entire eco-system is being re-generated. Vegetation generated in this process is disposed of in a composite pit near the lake.It is also reported that about 500,000 cubic metres of silt was removed from the lake. This silt was then put to use for a strengthening of embankment and building of islands as wintering grounds for migratory birds.After the above initial restoration works of the lake and its feeder system were mostly completed by the JDA, during 2003, private sector developers were invited to develop identified tourism components on the land adjoining the lake. After following the due process, a joint sector undertaking called the PDCOR was formed between the JDA of the Rajasthan Government and the consortia of private developers with the lead provided by M/s. KGK Enterprises. The project for tourism development was entrusted to this joint group. The tourism project entailed the development of Convention Centre and Art Gallery, Multiplex and Entertainment Centre, Craft Bazaar, Arts and Craft Village, Resort Hotels, restaurants, and food courts, public park and gardens including responsibility for restoration and maintenance of the Jal Mahal.The interior of the Jal Mahal Palace is not open to visitors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lakes in India\nLake Palace\n Media related to Jal Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Just like my last visit in 2017, I am still confused why this structure was built. This time I had an even worse experience with a foul smell in the waters when we tried to get some pictures from the road. The hawkers on the street makes the things a bit more clumsy. This place",
          "Title according to our guide so could be a furphy ?? But obvious that it would be a cooler location during the heat of Summer with cool water breezes. What is known is that it was built in 1799 AD and is only viewed from the roadside. A hundred hawkers on site , so it is a well",
          "The still waters give a perfect reflection and so this is good for a photograph. You can only view this from the road and cannot go into it. It was a former hunting palace and is presently being converted. There is a market in the area by the place that gives the best views.",

          "Not as spectacular as mooted. A palace in the middle of a lake, can be viewed from the lake side walk 150-200m away. The many hawkers and street vendors detract from the possible beauty and allure of this palace. The hazy atmosphere also diminished the view, making photography",
          "It is now known as Taj Lake Palace. It is located right in the midst of Lake Pichola. Standing tall and beautiful in the middle of Lake, Taj Lake Palace is an 18th-century historic stay in the City of Lakes offering an ethereal experience of the era of kings and queens",
          "This Palace probably looks more picturesque in the evening (I hope), because it is very average to see by daytime. We were told by our driver that you cannot actually go across the water to the Jal mahal, not sure if this is true or not. If so, its a very average drive by",

          "I guess the only reason I like this place is because it was poking up out of the water like a floating Hotel. I guess the royalty in the area found it nice in the summer time because the water cooled the entire building. I thought that was very interesting. I don't know if you",
          "This is worth a stop along the road as this is one of a kind, even if you\u2019ve been to Venice! You\u2019ll fight for space along the hockers and the mopeds but the juxtaposition of water and palace is odd to say the least.",

          "This is just a quick stop on the way to or from the Amber Fort. The palace is in the middle of the lake and looks like it is flooded. The palace is not open to the public and the view is free. The view is amazing as the lake is also surrounded by mountains.",
          "The Palace itself is inaccessible, but the street itself has great view. Specially when lights in evening are turned on. The small chowpati sort of feeling, with good bargain stalls to buy traditional stuff.",

          "This was an excellent place to chill out and enjoy the beauty of JalMahal. It gives you a feeling of how old emperor used to enjoy life the fullest as a tyrant. There are many options for street food, pictures and chai on the Vista point. You can also take a picture by renting",

          "Not a place you can actually visit so focus on the pictures you can take from afar. once you\u2019ve taken the pictures you can enjoy a nice walk through the market vendors that are set up along the strip. A good place to buy souvenirs and make sure to hustle on the prices.",
          "Good that it is located on the way to or from the Amber fort. It\u2019s a nice area, quite touristic but worth a stop. Scenic pictures possible. The lake with the water castle canalso be seen from top of Nahargarh fort, great views. Afterdark it is lit up. The coconut water we had",

          "Wao... what a sight.... We wanted to see the palace from inside, but that is not an option... But people see Jal Mahal from atleast atleast a distance of 1 Km... because this palace is in the water / river. the best part of this place is that you have so many small shops where",
          "Only really a brief photo opportunity stop off, but none the less stunning to look at. Also sometimes know as the Floating Palace. I you are visiting Jaipur it is well worth seeing Jal Mahal.",
          "The Jal Mahal is 4km to the north of Jaipur and is located on the main Amer-Jaipur road. Most visitors to the Jal Mahal combine the visit with the Amer fort as both attractions are on the same side of Jaipur. Tourists who view the Water Palace from the banks of Lake Sagar are",

          "I really cannot understand why this palace is never mentioned amonth the top 10 things to do, or see in Jaipur. Almost any guide does not consider it relevant, instead, in my opinion it is the real unique attraction of the city. Ofcourse it would be better if you could reach it",
          "Stopping here for photos of this beautiful idyllic palace, set in the midst of a calm lake. We were midway between Jaipur and Amber Fort. Lots of activity on the lake side with sellers of all sorts. I was also fascinated by the tameness of the birds at the lake side especially",

          "This was a really cool one. When we saw it we wondered how did they build the Jal Mahal with all the water.. They build the Jal Mahal then put the water. That is so neat. It was beautiful as well, in the middle of the water with mountains in the background.",

          "Jal mahal itself has nothing to do but you could see a lot of beautiful things for shopping. I would really like to recommend you to click pictures with traditional rajasthani clothes. Rs.50 for smaller picture and Rs.100 for a bigger one.",
          "This is a nice place located in the center of a lake. Entry is not permitted and must be watched from the road side itself which is disappointing",
          "When you are planning for Amer/Nahargarh/jaigarh forts, this floating palace is on the way. Can stop for 5-10mins for having picture.",
          "This was a unique stop during my tour of Jaipur after visiting Amer Fort, which is very close by. All we could do was stop on the side of the road to take a picture, but it\u2019s pretty surreal to see this floating palace that has an astonishing four additional stories underneath",
          "Visited oct'17. Its a photo stop spot during jaipur siteseen. View is nice. Even in footpath on will get lots of rajasthani stuff- very reasonable price !!!",

          "We stopped for photos from the road as that\u2019s all we could do. Apparently, it\u2019s now privately leased. Even so, it\u2019s a wonderful setting and makes for some lovely photos so it\u2019s worth a stop for a few minutes",
          "You cannot go in as there is an issue with the government over the lease of this place, but photos from outside are amazing. Stop and take some, but ignore the shop owners and ladies with babies trying to make you take pictures with them for tips.",

          "Jal Mahar or the summer palace for the royals. This palace can only be seen from far off distance as it is not possible to reach the fort as there are no boats. It looks beautiful in the evening and being a heritage site and can be skipped if not interested.",
          "It's an extremely beautiful place at night with attractive lighting. During the day there are shops that rent you clothes and click pictures of you and sell them to you for 100 rupees per picture. But you can bargain as the quality of picture isn't that great but it's worth it",
          "The view from Jal Mahal is to die for. It is recommended to have a sunrise view here once, thus go call your friends at early dawn and leave to see sun rising at Jal Mahal.",

          "I was expecting another, wow! tick seen it, moment. Yet I was strangely at awe at such an amazing sight. Is it simply the love story behind, or the years of terrible back break labour that's gone into making it? But its simply breathtaking, it brought a tear to my eyes. The",
          "It is on the way from Jaipur city to the two palaces on the outskirt of the city and you can basically get down and check it out quickly. You cannot really access it now as services to the building has been stopped. Which basically makes it a 10m visit. While, I can imagine its",
          "It looks beautiful inside a lake surrounded by water and clouds and that's pretty much it. Whatever back story it had couldn't be seen as one can not go inside and can be viewed only from outside. But the view is worth from outside and I do recommend seeing it from the hill on",

          "Very nice view, the lake is a little dirty but the palace looks very beautiful. We had a great time together.",
          "The plastic and other trash around the palace really breaks your heart. The people around the area won't ever stop trying to sell you things. I'd say that you can just look at it from a moving vehicle and go on with your day at Jaipur.",

          "This Jal Mahal is situated in the middle of the lake. So there is no permission to enter inside the Jal Mahal. you can see this Jal Mahal from lake shore. But there is also small market near lake. So if you want to buy any traditional items from Jaipur then it is a good place.",
          "We got our taxi to stop off here on the way to Amber Fort. You cannot go in our around Jal Mahal as it sits in the centre of the water. You can only take pictures. It is on the direct road to Amber Fort so it is just a case of pulling over to the side of the road to get a",

          "To view this magnificient place was just breathtaking as one begins to wonder how did people of more than 300 hundreds years ago build a structure in the water. Mind you the palace had rooms under water! The technology was a simple case of this being built first and a man made",

          "What could've been a great marvel ended up a damp squib as the area surrounding the Mahal hasn't been maintained and rather the water surrounding the Mahal has been littered with garbage and cattle. Glad that the Mahal itself hasn't become a mess inspite of being surrounded by",

          "I must admit I was a bit let down by this palace. It features prominently in Jaipur photos and places to visit, but I would call it a roadside attraction, not much more. I don\u2019t want to take away from the unique setting of a grand palace rising out of a man made lake (reservoir)",
          "I had many expectations from this place as it is one of the most famous tourist places of Jaipur. The expectations were badly shattered when I visited the place. A small beautiful palace in the middle of extremely unclean pond is what you get to see there. U will have to",

          "Nothing spectacular during the day, it can be seen from a distance and access is not allowed to the palace. Lights at night and the nearly empty footpath which is usually filled with hawkers during the day make it ideal for a light evening stroll or may be a run.",
          "This is a pretty (closed) palace on Man Sagar Lake. It makes for great photos and when we were there it was nice to walk along the esplanade - there are camel rides to be had, and locals are out strolling, selling goods but we were left alone except for the occasional tuk tuk",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Jaigarh Fort is situated on the promontory called the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the Aravalli range; it overlooks the Amer Fort and the Maota Lake, near Amer in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. The fort was built by Jai Singh II in 1726 to protect the Amer Fort and its palace complex and was named after him.The fort, rugged and similar in structural design to the Amer Fort, is also known as Victory Fort. It has a length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) along the north\u2013south direction and a width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). The fort features a cannon named \"Jaivana\"(Jaivana Cannon), which was manufactured in the fort precincts and was then the world's largest cannon on wheels. Jaigarh Fort and Amer Fort are connected by subterranean passages and considered as one complex.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Jaigarh Fort, located on one of the peaks of the Aravalli range of hills is built about 400 m above the Amer Fort. It provides an excellent of view of Aravalli hills and the Amer Fort down below.\nThe fort is 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) away from Jaipur city. It stands on a short diversion from the Jaipur-Delhi Highway, which leads to the Jaivaan cannon at the Dungar Darwaza ('Darwaza' means \"gate\"), the same road leads to another important fort called the Nahargarh Fort. It can also be approached from the Amer Fort over a short climb along a steep hill track, arriving at the Awami Gate near the fort museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAmer was known in the ancient and medieval period as Dhundhar (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers). What is known in the present day as Jaigarh Fort, which was actually the main defensive structure rather than the palace itself. The two structures are interconnected by a series of encompassing fortifications and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 10th century onwards. The history of Amer and Jaigarh is indelibly linked to these rulers, as they founded their empire at Amer.\n\n\n== Cannon foundry ==\nDuring the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, which is located 150 miles south-west of Delhi, became one of the world's most efficient cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines in the vicinity of the fort. The cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace creating temperatures as high as 2400 \u00b0F, the heated air would melt the metal. The molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and pass into a cannon mold in the casting pit. Most of those cannons were massive, mostly 16 ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Rajput also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the cannon barrels. When the Mughal war of succession broke out in 1658 Dara Shikoh secured the cannon outpost of Jaigarh Fort until he was defeated and executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb. Later however, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Jai Singh II as the official Mughal quiladar of Jaigarh Fort according to a Firman, ultimately Jai Singh II is known to have molded the great Jaivana Cannon by utilizing the important foundry and devices inside Jaigarh Fort.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe fort is highly fortified with thick walls of red sandstone and is spread over a layout plan with a length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) and a width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi); it has an impressive square garden (50 metres (160 ft) square) within it. Ramparts in each corner are sloping and provide access to the upper level structures. The palaces have court rooms and halls with screened windows. A central watch tower on a raised ground provides excellent vistas of the surrounding landscape. The Aram Mandir and the garden within its courtyard, on the northern side of the fort complex, has a triple arched entrance \"The Awani Darwaza\" which was refurbished in recent times to get fine views of the Sagar Lake (an artificial lake); water from this lake used to be transported to the fort in pouches loaded on elephant backs and also by humans carrying water pots. The triple arch gateway with fortification walls above it is painted red and yellow. It is oriented in an east\u2013west direction and faces west. The architectural features are of Indo-Persian style with cyclopean walls built with dressed stone and plastered with lime mortar. There are two temples within the fort precincts, one is the Ram Harihar temple of the 10th century and the other one is the Kal Bhairav temple of 12th century vintage.\n\nThe water supply facilities in the fort was met by creating water harvesting structures in the vicinity in the Aravalli catchment and conveying water through a canal on the west side of the fort over a 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) distance (seen at site) to be stored in three underground tanks below the central courtyard. The largest tank had a capacity of 6 million gallons of water. There were completely false rumors, that a treasure belonging to the Kachwaha rulers of Amer had been stacked in the fort precincts (including the water tanks), that led to a totally unsuccessful search. The search had been ordered during the Emergency declared by the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during 1975\u20131977. A futile search was also launched, in 1977, of all the buildings in the fort, by the Income Tax department, using metal detectors. There was also a Parliament Question on this issue where a question was posed whether a \"Search for treasure carried out from 10th June 1976 till November 1976 by the Income Tax Authorities at Jaigarh Fort on the Jaipur Delhi Road was closed to ordinary traffic for one or two days so as to make way for military trucks carrying treasures to the residence of the then Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi?\". However, the search carried out for treasures by an Army unit at Jaigarh Fort, after a three-month search had found no treasures. It was then conjectured that Sawai Jai Singh probably used the treasure to build the city of Jaipur.\nArmouryThe armoury chamber here has a wide display of swords, shields, guns, muskets and also a 50 kilograms (110 lb) cannonball. Pictures on display are old photographs of Jaipur's Maharajas namely, Sawai Bhawani Singh and Major General Man Singh II who served in the Indian Army as senior officers.\nMuseumThe museum is located to the left of the Awami Gate; it has exhibits of photographs of the Royalty of Jaipur, stamps and many artefacts, which include a circular pack of cards. A spittoon of 15th century vintage and also hand drawn plan of the palaces are seen in the museum.\n\n\n=== Jaivana cannon ===\n\nJaigarh Fort was a centre of artillery production for the Rajputs. It is now home to the Jaivana \u2013 at the time of its manufacture in 1720, it was the world's largest cannon on wheels of the Early Modern Era. The foundry where it was manufactured is also located here. A plaque at the entrance to the enclosure where the Jaivan Cannon is displayed gives relevant information on the history of the Cannon, its size and use. This cannon was never used in any battle as the Rajput rulers of Amer had friendly relations with the Mughals. This testifies to well-preserved features of fort. The cannon was fired only once with a charge of 100 kilograms (220 lb) of gunpowder and when fired covered a distance of about 35 kilometres (22 mi).The Jaivana was manufactured during the reign of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II (1699\u20131743) at a foundry in Jaigarh. The barrel is 20.19 foot (6.15 m) in length and weighs 50 tonnes. It has a diameter of 11 inches (280 mm). The barrel has decorations carved on it which depict trees, an elephant scroll and a pair of birds (ducks). It is mounted on wheels and has the mechanism of two back wheels mounted on roller pin bearings, to turn it 360\u00b0 and fire in any direction. A tin shed was built to protect the cannon against weather. The cannon had a range of 22 miles and used 50 kilograms (110 lb) balls.\n\n\n== Ticket ==\nThe tickets are priced at INR 85 per person for foreign tourists, and INR 50 per person for Indian tourists.\n\n\n== Timings ==\nThe gates of Jaigarh Fort open at 0900 hours and closes at 1645 hours throughout the week. It is not advised to stay here in the evening as Jaigarh Fort is surrounded by thick deciduous forest. Nahargarh sanctuary is a part of the forest, and therefore wild animals lurk in the dark.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Jawahar Circle is a garden situated in Jaipur city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, built by the Jaipur Development Authority.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nJawahar Circle is claimed by Locals to be the biggest circular park in Asia developed on a highway traffic circle. It is situated along Malviya Nagar near Sanganer Airport on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg. (though the same claim of being the largest circle in Asia, is also claimed by Swaraj Road, Thrissur in Kerala ignoring the fact that the largest Traffic Circle or Round about in the world with a diameter of more than 3.5 km is situated in PutraJaya Malaysia.)\nThe diameter of the circle is 452 m and the circumference measures 1420 m. This park was fully developed by JDA (Jaipur Development Authority), and is one of Jaipur's favorite leisure places. There are multiple concentric tracks in the park. It is surrounded by Rose Gardens.\nA number of attractive features like musical fountains, modern play equipment, jogging tracks are being added to it.\nJDA has spent 170 lacs for the development of this circle. The money has been judiciously spent on jogging tracks, walkways, parking, landscaping, benches and a musical fountain.\nThe Fountain has been installed in a water-body in the center of the park. Every evening at 7 pm a show is held for 30 minutes, when the water sprays dance to the music & are illuminated by colored lights all adding up to a rare experience. Taking a hint from the Si-Fi world they even show music video\u2019s on a wall of spray. And after the show you can have some chaat or Saras Lassi or Custard Kulfi in the Chaat Bazaar.\nRadius of the water body is 47 m. There are 290 effects. Height of the fountain is 25 m. Water screen size is 27 m wide by 9 m height.  There are 316 colored lights. The video  projector is 15,000 lumens.\nA fact worth appreciating here is that Rajasthan is a desert state and to maintain such big gardens & fountains with drinking water would be foolhardy so the government is using re-cycled water which though safe for the garden & the fountain is definitely not safe for drinking or for bathing with. So it is a good idea to stay away from the water in the fountain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJawahar Circle - Map",

It was built by Rajasthan government with the purpose of preserving Rajasthani arts and crafts.\nThe centre has been made in eight blocks housing museums, one amphi theatre and the other closed auditorium, library, arts display rooms, cafeteria, small hostel and art-studio. \nIt also houses two permanent art galleries and three other galleries. and host its own theatre festival each year.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe design was prepared by the noted architect Charles Correa in 1986 and the building was ready in 1992. The plan is inspired by the original city plan of Jaipur, consisting of nine squares with central square left open.The Jawahar Kala Kendra adapts and applies concepts from ancient architectural principles called the Vastu Vidya.The centre is an analogue of the original city pIan of Jaipur drawn up by the Maharaja, a scholar, mathematician and astronomer, Jai Singh the Second, in the mid-17th century. His city plan, guided by the Shipla Shastras, was based on the ancient Vedic madala of nine squares or houses which represent the nine planets (including two imaginary ones Ketu and Rahu). Due to the presence of a hill one of the squares was transposed to the east and two of the squares were amalgamated to house the palace.\nCorrea's plan for the Kendra invokes directly the original navagraha or nine house rnandala. One of the squares is pivoted to recall the original city plan and also to create the entrance. The plan of Jaipur city based on the nine square Yantra in which one square is displaced and two central squares combined. the squares is defined by 8m high wall, symbolic of the fortification wall along the Jaipur old city\n\n\n== Theatre ==\nRangayan, mihir, Open Theatre, are few of the many theatres housed in JKK.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJawahar Kala Kendra A Case-study by students of School of Planning & Architecture, New Delhi",

          "Raj Mandir is a stunning building. The art work on the walls and the decor inside is beautiful. The building just looks grand and regal. Like many other reviewers have said, the movie was secondary - most outsiders go to Raj Mandir only to see the theatre. It's easy to see why",
          "Atleast one visit here is a must. I have not seen a movie theater like this elsewhere in the country. The carvings are all excellent. It's more about the theater than the movie. The movie does not matter while you are in Raj Mandir. Located in the heart of the city close to",

        "wiki": "Jaipur State, historically known as the Kingdom of Amber, was a kingdom of India, centred on Jaipur town and later a princely state during the British period. It existed from the 12th century and was in a subsidiary alliance with the British from 1818 until their withdrawal from India in August 1947. It was then fully independent until its ruler acceded to India in April 1949, and retained some internal self-government for a period after that.\n\n\n== History ==\nJaipur's predecessor state was the kingdom of Dhundhar or Dausa, founded in 1093 by Dullah Rai, also known as Dulha Rao. The state was known as Amber between the fourteenth century and 1727. In that year, a new capital was built and named Jayapura, when the kingdom was renamed as Jaipur.\n\n\n=== Dhundhar Kingdom ===\nThe Kachwahas claim descent from Kusha, son of the legendary Rama. Their ancestors allegedly migrated from Rama's kingdom of Kosala and established a new dynasty at Gwalior. After 31 generations, they moved to Rajputana and created a kingdom at Dhundhar. Dullah Rai, one of the ancestors of the Kachwaha rulers, defeated the Meenas of Manchi and Amber and later completed the conquest of Dhundhar by defeating the Bargurjars of Dausa and Deoti.\n\n\n=== Amber Kingdom ===\nThe rulers of Amber fought as generals in the army of Prithviraj Chauhan and later under the banner of Rana Sanga against the Mughals under Babur. The small kingdom of Amber was later conquered by Maldev Rathore and became feudatories of Marwar until the 16th century, Bharmal Kachwaha, sought alliance with Akbar to gain his political and military support against the Rathores of Marwar and his own divided clansmen. He was formally recognised as a Raja by the Mughals and was invested into the Mughal nobility in return for his daughter's marriage to Emperor Akbar. Raja Bharmal's daughter, Mariam-uz-Zamani, who married Akbar, later became the mother of the\nfourth Mughal emperor Jahangir. She gained prestige in the Mughal court both during the reign of her husband and that of her son as Empress and Queen mother respectively. By this relation, the Rajas of Amer also gained significant prominence in the Mughal court.\nA governor was appointed to oversee Bharmal's territory and a tribute arrangement saw Bharmal given a salaried rank, paid for from a share of the area's revenue.The ruling dynasty of Amber prospered under Mughal rule and provided the Mughal Empire with some distinguished generals. Among them were Bhagwant Das, Man Singh I, who fought and governed from Kabul to Orissa and Assam and Jai Singh I.\n\n\n=== Jaipur Kingdom ===\nJai Singh I was succeeded by Ram Singh I, Bishan Singh and Jai Singh II. Jai Singh II, also known as Sawai Jai Singh, ruled the state from 1699 to 1743 and was a famous mathematician and astronomer. During his rule, the new capital city of Jaipur was founded. in 1727.\nThroughout the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the armies of Jaipur were in a constant state of warfare. Towards the end of the 18th century, the Jats of Bharatpur and the Kachwaha chief of Alwar declared themselves independent from Jaipur and each annexed the eastern portion of Jaipur's territory. This period of Jaipur's history is characterised by internal power-struggles and constant military conflicts with the Marathas, Jats, other Rajput states, as well as the British and the Pindaris. Jaipur suffered against the Rathors of Marwar in the Battle of Gangwana with appalling losses. The kingdom again suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Maratha forces of Mahadji Scindia in the Battle of Patan in 1790, forcing the rulers of Jaipur to pay heavy tributes. Nevertheless, enough wealth remained in Jaipur for the patronage of fine temples/palaces, continuity of its courtly traditions and the well-being of its citizens and merchant communities. Jaipurs last attempt to gain freedom from Gwalior ended in a defeat at the Battle of Malpura.  A treaty was initially made by Maharaja Sawai Jagat Singh and the British under Governor General Marquis Wellesley in 1803, however the treaty was dissolved shortly afterwards by Wellesley's successor, Lord Cornwallis. In this event, Jaipur's Ambassador to Lord Lake observed that \"This was the first time, since the English government was established in India, that it had been known to make its faith subservient to its convenience\".In 1818 Jaipur became a British protectorate by entering into a subsidiary alliance. In 1835 there was a serious disturbance in the city because of a false rumour that the British had murdered the infant raja to ensure the annexation, after which the British government intervened. The state later became well-governed and prosperous. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, when the British invoked the treaty to request assistance in the suppression of rebellious sepoys, the Maharaja opted to preserve his treaty, and thus sent in troops to help to subdue the uprisings in the area around Gurgaon.Jaipur state had a revenue of Rs.65,00,000 in 1901, making it the wealthiest Princely state in Rajputana.Jaipur's last princely ruler signed the accession to the Indian Union on 7 April 1949.In 2019, titular Maharaja Padmanabh Singh (born 12 July 1998), full title Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh of Jaipur, is the young monarch of Jaipur, a city in northwestern India famous for its pink architecture and imperial palaces. Estimates of the royal family's wealth vary, but Singh is estimated to control a fortune of between $697 million and $2.8 billion.\n\n\n== Ruling dynasty ==\n\n\n=== List of rulers ===\n\n\n==== Rulers ====\n27 Dec 966 \u2013 15 Dec 1006 Sorha Deva (d. 1006)\n15 Dec 1006 \u2013 28 Nov 1036 Dullah Rai (d. 1036)\n28 Nov 1036 \u2013 20 Apr 1039 Kakil (d. 1039)\n21 Apr 1039 \u2013 28 Oct 1053 Hanu (d. 1053)\n28 Oct 1053 \u2013 21 Mar 1070 Janddeo (d. 1070)\n22 Mar 1070 \u2013 20 May 1094 Pajjun Rai (d. 1094)\n20 May 1094 \u2013 15 Feb 1146 Malayasi (d. 1146)\n15 Feb 1146 \u2013 25 Jul 1179 Vijaldeo (d. 1179)\n25 Jul 1179 \u2013 16 Dec 1216 Rajdeo (d. 1216)\n16 Dec 1216 \u2013 18 Oct 1276 Kilhan (d. 1276)\n18 Oct 1276 \u2013 23 Jan 1317 Kuntal (d. 1317)\n23 Jan 1317 \u2013 6 Nov 1366 Jonsi (d. 1366)\n6 Nov 1366 \u2013 11 Feb 1388 Udaikarn (d. 1388)\n11 Feb 1388 \u2013 16 Aug 1428 Narsingh (d. 1428)\n16 Aug 1428 \u2013 20 Sep 1439 Banbir (d. 1439)\n20 Sep 1439 \u2013 10 Dec 1467 Udharn (d. 1467)\n10 Dec 1467 \u2013 17 Jan 1503 Chandrasen (d. 1503)\n17 Jan 1503 \u2013 4 Nov 1527 Prithviraj Singh I (d. 1527)\n4 Nov 1527 \u2013 19 Jan 1534 Puranmal (d. 1534)\n19 Jan 1534 \u2013 22 Jul 1537 Bhim Singh (d. 1537)\n22 Jul 1537 \u2013 15 May 1548 Ratan Singh (d. 1548)\n15 May 1548 \u2013 1 June 1548 Askaran (d. 1599)\n1 June 1548 \u2013 27 Jan 1574 Bharmal (d. 1574)\n27 Jan 1574 \u2013 4 Dec 1589 Bhagwant Das (b. 1527 \u2013 d. 1589)\n4 Dec 1589 \u2013 6 Jul 1614 Man Singh (b. 1550 \u2013 d. 1614)\n6 Jul 1614 \u2013 13 Dec 1621 Bhau Singh (d. 1621)\n13 Dec 1621 \u2013 28 Aug 1667 Jai Singh I (b. 1611 \u2013 d. 1667)\n10 Sep 1667 \u2013 30 Apr 1688:  Ram Singh I (b. 1640 \u2013 d. 1688)\n30 Apr 1688 \u2013 19 Dec 1699:  Bishan Singh (b. 1672 \u2013 d. 1699)\n19 Dec 1699 \u2013 21 September 1743:  Jai Singh II (b. 1688 \u2013 d. 1743)\n1743 \u2013 12 December 1750:  Ishwari Singh (b. 1721 \u2013 d. 1750)\n1750 \u2013 5 March 1768:  Madho Singh I (b. 1728 \u2013 d. 1768)\n1768 \u2013 13 April 1778:  Prithvi Singh II (b. c. 1762 \u2013 d. 1778)\n1778 \u2013 1803:  Pratap Singh (b. 1764 \u2013 d. 1803)\n1803 \u2013 21 November 1818: Jagat Singh II (b. ... \u2013 d. 1818)\n22 December 1818 \u2013 25 April 1819: Mohan Singh (regent) (b. c. 1809 \u2013 d. ...)\n25 April 1819 \u2013  6 February 1835: Jai Singh III (b. 1819 \u2013 d. 1835)\nFeb 1835 \u2013 18 September 1880: Ram Singh II (b. 1835 \u2013 d. 1880)\n18 September 1880 \u2013  7 September 1922: Madho Singh II (b. 1861 \u2013 d. 1922)\n7 September 1922 \u2013 15 August 1947 (subsidiary):  Sawai Man Singh II (b. 1912 \u2013 d. 1970)\n15 August 1947 \u2013 7 April 1949 (independent): Sawai Man Singh II (b. 1912 \u2013 d. 1970)\n\n\n==== Titular rulers ====\n7 April 1949 \u2013 24 June 1970: Sawai Man Singh II\n24 June 1970 \u2013 28 December 1971: Sawai Bhawani Singh (b. 1931 \u2013 d. 2011)\n\n\n==== Ceremonial rulers ====\n28 December 1971 \u2013 17 April 2011: Sawai Bhawani Singh (b. 1931 \u2013 d. 2011)\n17 April 2011 \u2013 present: Padmanabh Singh (b. 1998)\n\n\n=== Other family members ===\nDiya Kumari\n\n\n== Jaipur Residency ==\n\nThe Jaipur Residency was established in 1821.

        "wiki": "Pratap Singh I (pronunciation ) (9 May 1540 \u2013 19 January 1597), popularly known as Maharana Pratap, was the 13th king of Mewar, a region in north-western India in the present-day state of Rajasthan.\n\n\n== Early life and accession ==\nMaharana Pratap was born in a Hindu Rajput family. He was born to Udai Singh II and Jaiwanta Bai. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia. He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar.After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed.\n\n\n== Battle of Haldighati ==\n\nThe bloody Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of the Rana. The Mughal emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Rana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable.The Battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 between Maharana Pratap and Akbar's forces led by Man Singh I of Amer. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture Maharana. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 5000-10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than six hours, Maharana found himself wounded and the day lost. The mughal were unable to capture him. He managed to escape to the hills and lived to fight another day.Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to capture Maharana Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur. As soon as the empire's focus shifted north-west, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and recaptured the western regions of his dominion. \n\n\n== Reconquest of Mewar ==\nMughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. In 1582, Maharana Pratap attacked and occupied the Mughal post at Dewair (or Dawer). This led to the automatic liquidation of all 36 Mughal military outposts in Mewar. After this defeat, Akbar stopped his military campaigns against Mewar. The victory of Dewair was a crowning glory for Maharana Pratap, with James Tod describing it as the \"Marathon of Mewar\". In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north-west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda. During this period, he also built a new capital, Chavand, near modern Dungarpur.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nReportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident at Chavand on 19 January 1597, aged 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I.\n\nHistorian Satish Chandra notes that Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of sporadic warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Shivaji Maharaj.\n\n\n== Television depictions ==\n2012\u20132015: Jodha Akbar, broadcast on Zee TV, where he was played by Anurag Sharma\n2013\u20132015: Bharat Ka Veer Putra \u2013 Maharana Pratap, broadcast by Sony Entertainment Television (India), where he was portrayed by Faisal Khan and Sharad Malhotra\n2016: ABP News presented Bharatvarsha, in which episode 8 showcased the story of Maharana Pratap.\n\n\n== Movies ==\n1946: Maharana Pratap Movie 1946\n2012: Maharana Pratap: The First Freedom Fighter\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSarkar, Jadunath (1960).

        "wiki": "Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defense ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBuilt mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection.The fort was extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas.Until April 1944, the Jaipur State government used for its official purposes solar time read from the Samrat Yantra in the Jantar Mantar Observatory, with a gun fired from Nahargarh Fort as the time signal.\nSome scenes in the movies Rang De Basanti, Shuddh Desi Romance and Sonar Kella were shot at Nahargarh Fort.\nJaipur wax museum is yet another attraction was built on the left side at the entrance of Nahargarh fort in support with Department of Archaeology & Museums Jaipur, Department of Tourism, Government of Rajasthan, The place earlier was known as Vishram Ghar- Rest House for the soldiers and Shastragar-Artillery, Jaipur wax museum is a brainchild of Mr. Anoop Srivastava the founder Director and inaugurated on December 17, 2016 by Bollywood star Govinda, the wax museum has more than 35 wax and silicon statues from the field of sports, Bollywood, social activists, freedom fighters, Sawai Ram Singh,Maharaja Jai Singh, Madho Singhi, and Rajmata Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur along with first look-alike robotic tiger, replica of Khonoor Diamond is a recent attraction,The one of its own kind Sheesh Mahal, the palace of mirrors, a new landmark of Jaipur built in the adjoining building with 25 million glass pieces with thikri, mirror work and gold polish giving a magnificent royal look and feel.[1]\n\n\n== Visitation ==\nThe ticket for the historical fort of Nahargarh costs INR 50 for Indian nationals. For foreign tourists, the cost goes up to INR 200. Students enjoy discounted prices. For foreign students, the ticket costs INR 25, and INR 5 for Indian students\nNahargarh fort is open from 10 a.m. and the gates of the fort closes in the evening at 05.30 p.m. The visitors are not advised to stay any later than that because the fort is surrounded by dense deciduous forest. The forest is part of Nahargarh Biological Park and home to many wild animals.\n\n\n== Nearby Attractions ==\nKanak Vrindavan\nJantar Mantar\nJaigarh Fort\nAmer Fort\nCity Palace\nHawa Mahal\nJal Mahal\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNahargarh Biological Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "Definitely the best was museum in all of India. Very life like statues, and friendly staff to explain the history. The statues of the Maharani of Jaipur both young and old are beautiful. But the main attraction is the Sheesh Mahal. Built a few years back, it is made completely",

          "A very small wax museum. There is no novelty. The statues are not at all attractive. The cost of entry ticket is on the higher side. Photography is at a cost. Just 15 to 25 min is enough to visit it. can be avoided.",

        "wiki": "Kanak Vrindavan is a garden in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. It is built in a valley surrounded by Aravali hills and is located on the way to the Amer Fort at the bottom of the Nahargarh hill. The place is approx 8 km north of the Jaipur city. The garden complex is having many nearby tourist attractions as the Amer fort Palace, Jaigarh fort and Nahargarh fort along with much lush greenery. The garden was coined by Kachchwaha Rajput Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur, approximately 275 years ago, at the time when the complex was built. It includes term 'Vrindavan' as the garden resembles the descriptions of the place, where God Sri Krishna had performed MahaRaas near Mathura, and word Kanak came from Maharaja\u2019s one of the Maharani Kanakde. This garden is compared to the valley of Vrindavan and the maharaja, consecrated an idol of Sri Krishna in a temple in the Kanak Vrindavan valley called the Shri Govind Deoji Parisar. The garden has a temple, a series of fountains and intricate marble decorations. It is managed by the Government of Rajasthan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kanak Vrindavan Valley Complex was built approximately 275 years ago by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur. This beautiful, greenery filled valley is surrounded by the Aravalli hills and often said to resemble the Vrindavan; the place where Lord Krishna enjoyed the Maharaas with Gopis. The Kanak Vrindavan Valley was built for entertainment and recreation of Maharani and the Maharaja. According to some people the Maharaja planned for an Ashvamedha Yagna and made arrangement of waters from sacred rivers to collect here. A Lord Krishna Temple named Govind Deoji was also built around the same time.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Kanak Vrindavan Garden is a beautifully constructed and chosen spot located in the valley of the Nahargarh hills, and is dotted with unique trees. It is full of trees and lawns, decorated with intricate 'chhatris', exquisite mirror and 'jali' work on the walls of the Govind Deoji temple, along with a support of a series of fountains. The main garden is divided into eight sections, and is having a main fountain called 'Parikrama', carved out of a single marble slab. Temple Garbha Griha is also placed inside the temple parisar (complex) and is decorated with delicate 'panni' work. These all season green gardens at the Valley offer a good view of Jaipur and other nearby attractions mainly Amer Fort and the Dharbawati River. The scenery has been used a number of times in many Bollywood films, such as Lamhe (1991). Some nearby attractions include: Amer Fort, Jal Mahal, Elephant Park, Nahargarh fort and Jaigarh Fort.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Kanak Vrindavan : Beautifully Tended Landscape\". pinkcity.com. 26 March 2012.

          "A MUST DO in Chengdu and one of my top 2 reasons for visiting this city (second to eating). As it is summer, going in morning is better suited weather wise for both humans and pandas. You can spend all day walking among the different areas and watch pandas feast on bamboo,",
          "If you want to experience more people in one spot than you ever have before then this is the place. We visited here as part of a day spent with a local guide who was very helpful in navigating the grounds, especially with prams and kids in tow. There was a very large crowd",
          "Loved every second of our 2 days spent here. It was all I hoped it would be. I had dreamed of holding a baby panda, but did not do this this time. The enclosures are large and well kept, and the Panda's seem happy enough. The only negative I'd say is the choice of places to",
          "One of the key things to really see the pandas, is get there early or when they feed them. They are lazy and private.",
          "LOVED seeing the Pandas. It was a rainy day, but our guide said that the Pandas are outside of their enclosures more when it is raining. The babies are adorable!",
          "We visited in the rain. The grounds are beautiful with paths, flora, fauna and signage in English and other languages. we were able to observe Pandas of all ages and stages and the Red Panda. The only similarity is the fact that they both eat bamboo. The panda used to be a",
          "We had only two hours to spend at the breeding centre which was really not enough time. The area is huge and beautiful to walk around. The enclosures for the pandas are divided into an adult area, a juvenile section and then the breeding centre with the tiny babies. We were told",
          "Very convenient to get there through public transport. Take a train and then switch to a bus to get to the entrance. The place is quite big and it will take at least half a day to explore. Cuteness overload here with so many pandas around. The baby pandas are especially cute and",
          "Worth the visit, have seen lots of Pandas playing, relaxing and eating. Have seen a baby panda. Best maintained panda center with a world class research center. Good views of the city from the park.",
          "Go early in the morning to miss the crowds, and also see the panda's at their most active. Easy to take a taxi form the city centre - not expensive and no need to queue up for buses etc.",
          "Had a lovely morning visit here with our guide. There were pandas everywhere and it was lovely to be able to see the newborns. The place covers a large area, but it was very crowded with tourists",
          "The weather was perfect and the Pandas including the Red Pandas were all in an active mood and made it interesting and entertaining",
          "This is a beautiful park with beautiful pandas of every ages, beginning from baby pandas to elder ones. You can watch them eating bambu or playing with their friends. There is a shop at the entrance which you can find many kinds of souvenirs. I recommend everbody to visit this",
          "Well worth a visit, the base opens at 7:30am so arrive as early as possible to get the most out of it.",
          "It is a must do when visiting Chengdu! We caught a 'DiDi' straight from our hotel in the morning. From reviews we got there about 8:30am. We bought tickets at the ticket office out the front. Upon entering we did not realise how large it was. We walked all the way to the back of",
          "I would personally recommend this to anyone visiting Chengdu, this place is huge so do allow a few hours to have a good walk around. there is a lot to see and it's a very calming and relaxing place to be.",
          "It's a giant 'zoo' for viewing giant panda and the small red panda. We had a very good time observing giant panda, taking pictures and video taping them. Go to the base in the early morning when the pandas are fed. We spent about two hours there easily. It was well worth the",
          "It's big, like a normal zoo but very different in that there is only one animal. Actually there are two, the Red Panda and the Giant Panda. Red panda only have a couple of pens and they are smaller and more elusive. There are Pandas everywhere! Just look for a crowd of people",
          "We arrived there (with our tickets) and they would not recognise them. Said we booked for the wrong date (we didn't). Because of limited English/Mandarin done via translator we decided to pay for new tickets. They told us to cancel the TripAdvisor tickets. We did but no refund",
          "During return flight from australia we had 10.5 hours of transit in Chengdu airport - 0540 am to 04:15 pm. with our experience at Beijing layover we waned to make use of this time and definitely dont want to visit and see Pandas in China. Getting transit visa if your nationality",
          "What a life, sleeping, eating and sleeping. This was a highlight and you can get so close, but bware the rude Chinese who are experts with their elbows at getting to the front. Saw the very young baby pandas just because my elbows are bigger than most",
          "We went on this tour today and had a great experience. Our tour guide, Hayley, was very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. She expertly guided us through the park and helped us get the best pictures possible all while sharing a lot of information about the pandas and expertly",
          "Cute animals alert! Even though the crowd made it hard for us to see the pandas up close, and the distance was quite far, but it was a nice experience. Should have came earlier when the pandas are still active! Just wished they would let us take a peek inside the room for the",
          "Opens 730am. Be there before 11am as they are most active in the morning. Spend abt 3 hrs here. Take MRT to Panda Avenue station. Panda Shuttle buses will b waiting outside. Buy tickets from the authorised ticketing staff near or in the buses. DO NOT buy from the people right",
          "I visited here was a friend late September and i loved the whole experience. I was worried that it would be too busy and we wouldnt see many pandas but we saw so many and it did get busy but we made sure to arrive very early to avoid most of the crowds. We planned to go on a",
          "This was definitely worth a visit. A group of my friends and I traveled from Guangzhou to Chengdu. We went right away in the morning and it seemed like we had the whole park to ourselves. We saw so many active pandas playing and eating. We also saw them sleeping. There were also",
          "Get there at exactly 0730 to be able to get on the open air tour trolly. Dress warm. Eat before you go, there is food available, but not very good.",
          "Great place, its incredible to see the pandas here. They look very relaxed. The baby area is particularly favourite with the visitors. This place gets pretty busy but if your patient enough you really enjoy the peace of the gardens.",
          "When in Chengdu, you can't miss the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base. Book a Day Tour to avoid long queue.",
          "This was a place where Pandas live. But i find it over-rated. There are a number of things that this park needs to improve on. Firstly, this place certainly needs more big proper walking paths for pedestrians. We paid additional money on top of the attraction ticket prices for",
          "A sensational location to observe Pandas. They are not in their natural environment, but they look happy. The location is also very beautiful, with nice gardens.",
          "The research base has very lovely grounds - bamboo forests, waterfalls, stone paths. The pandas like them too, so much so that they hide in them all day. Pandas find a comfortable position and stay in one spot apparently until it is time to eat. It's hard to spot them amongst",
          "We did expect more kind of a zoo, but this Pandas seem to live in paradise in Chengdu. They have big enclosures and a huge area to roam around and therefore they seem to be happy. We arrived at 10:30am and still there were most of them very active, playing and eating, sure some",
          "I guess this is one of the only places on Earth, one can see a baby panda within a metre (separated by glass). Super adorable. BUT!!!! ... To avoid the crowd, we reached the Park at 8am and at the Nursery Compound, the visitors traffic is still bad ... literally being pushed",
          "Came here as part of a tour. Really crowded and most of the pandas were asleep so did not see much activity. Saw red pandas too which was great.",
          "We were transiting through Chengdu and decided to use the wait to see the pandas. One hour and half to two are sufficient to see the whole base. It is organized very well and the grounds are well suited to showcase the pandas. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that",
          "A must place to visit when you\u2019re in Chengdu. If you\u2019re lucky you might be able to catch a baby panda. They\u2019re just so adorable.",
          "We are DIY travellers--don't like tours---and also not morning people. When I read that you better be there at the crack of dawn to see anything, that didn't sit well. So instead we decided to take a chance and go in the afternoon--we left our hotel (Sofitel) about 1:30pm. We",
          "It was the very reason we come to Chengdu. A taxi ride from our hotel was reasonable in cost. The real beauty was the free entry to the base as both of us are over certain age. You do need to be able to walk up hill a little. We toured the base back to front by seeing the",
          "We were on a guided tour having travelled from England. Arrived early but there were already a lot of people at the centre. Easy to get in and saw our first panda within minutes of arriving. It was a bit crowded at most viewing areas (4-5 people deep in places). The pandas",
          "Chengdu is the hometown of giant pandas. This is our first visit to Chengdu. It was so interesting to see the Panda while asleep. None of them were playing. The red panda was in active mode. The Research Base is like a park. It was large and like a tropical rainforest. the",
          "It was wonderful to see the pandas so close up. Get there early - we got there just after 8am - as they are active after their breakfast but then head off for their nap. It was lovely to see a couple of adolescent pandas tumbling around together, pulling on each other's ears",
          "It's much better than a city zoo or circus, and we did not see the entire grounds, and true Pandas are more endangered and unique than typical farms animals, but I still felt sort of sorry for the Pandas. The animals I saw are still surrounded by discreetly hidden electric",
          "The Panda research base is excellent. It is quite an extensive site and involves a lot of walking sometimes on an incline. You can however take transport form the entrance to the base. There are both Giant and Red Pandas to see and they are housed in large compounds with large",
          "This is a beautiful park environment. If possible, pick a cool weather day to visit so the pandas are active. It was lovely to see them moving about and younger ones playing together in the trees! There was a large crowd to view the baby pandas (one in an incubator and one in a",
          "Although on a reserve it is also a major research centre for this endangered species. Surprisingly it is just on the Edge of a get large city. Be prepared for a lengthy walk around the reserve and it is quite hilly in places but there Are transport available. You will never get",
          "Err interesting. A must see when visiting Chengdu. In addition, the park where the Panda Center is located is quite beautiful and worth walking through.",
          "The Giant Panda Research Base is amazing but get there by 7.30. We caught a metro to the Panda Avenue stop and caught a taxi for 20 yuan to the Panda Base. Couldn't see the buses as it was dark. Arrived 7.15am at Panda Base. Stood in line for tickets - no issue buying tickets",
          "An overcast early morning allowed us to see the Pandas feeding. They feed with their backs to you, not interested in your attempts to photograph them. Maybe due to the weather, the crowds were tolerable . Only 8,00 people shuffling about. But in the incubators, the crowds were",
          "It was lovely to see the pandas and to view, briefly, the babies. The worst thing we're the queues of people, so it took a long time to view very little. The paths are no good for pushchairs and wheelchairs, as there are steps and also trees in the middle of the paths, no",
          "A very well frequented preserve. Try to be there early. It seems to get very crowded any day of the week. Nice grounds with many opportunities to see all varieties of Pandas. It does involve quite a bit of walking. It is hard to get a taxi for the return trip. Do not be shy to",
          "In a land of amazing things to see, the Giant Panda Research base holds its own. Literally hundreds of pandas from tiny babies to juveniles to adults all existing in natural conditions wherever possible. It literally blows your mind to see how they are cared for and enabled to",
          "Situated a reasonably short drive from Chengdu proper the center is well laid out and offers great views of all the Pandas large and small and provides very informative vignettes on their life and the work of the people operating the center. Recommend getting their after the",
          "Pandas are amazing, you do need to go early so that you can catch them having their breakfast as after that they do not do very much. Me and my boyfriend were very lucky, nearly all the tourists had gone so we decided to have another little walk around and we were able to watch",
          "Seeing this facility was a dream of mine and it didn't disappoint. Loved viewing the pandas outside being as active as pandas can be! The local people need to be more considerate of visitors and not spend so much time taking selfies. A must visit when in Chengdu.",
          "Its a Panda Theme Park. Very well oiled to handle crowd. The only exception is a tiny space to see baby panda. Not nice to be indoors with loud speakers. Do go as early as possible. We were there around 10am. The stars had their breakfast and were all digesting the bamboo in",
          "This centre is beautiful, full of vegetation and in a clean setting for watching the pandas, but it's imperative to be there early as it's a very busy place and the crowds gather where you can see the pandas to a point that viewing is impossible. The cafe offers very good lunch",
          "This is just a beautiful place-and the Pandas are amazing, go early so that you can catch them having their breakfast, because after that they just laze around and don\u2019t do much. Go and see the babies in the enclosed area they are like big fluffy balls. Also visit the red Pandas",
          "Started the day early arriving at the breeding Center at about 8am by taxi which was only about \u00a312 for a 30 min drive, the cost for admission surprised me at only \u00a36.00 entry. I looked online at an organised trip that would have cost about \u00a3112.00 The place is remarkable, all",
          "Think huge safari park, zoo, and research facility dedicated to pandas. Our visit exceeded our expectations. First the place is huge. We walked 4.5 miles throughout the park and still didn\u2019t visit all of the exhibits. They do have a shuttle, but the queue is always long and",
          "We were visited on cool Sunday afternoon in November, and were delighted by many very active pandas, even the red ones! Many reviews said to go in the early morning to see the pandas active, but we think that since it was a pretty cool day, they were keen to move about in the",
          "Seeing the pandas is an awesome experience and outweighs the challenges with crowd management which are especially severe in the nursery areas. Suggestion is to get there early and spend half the day so you can see the pandas when they are active as well as appreciate the",
          "Thanks to the helpful TripAdvisor community, we understood that the earlier you go the better the experience as the pandas are more active and there'll be less crowds. We used Trip dot com to buy tickets online, it was very simple and useful; once purchased (no extra fees)",
          "Yes, this place gets crowded (primarily busloads of Chinese and European tourists), but you can still see quite a number of pandas, including babies in the \"nursery\" as well as the red pandas. We saw probably 25 or so large pandas during our walk-through (it was WAY too crowded",
          "Because it is so close to the city the Chengdu Panda Base has a zoo-like atmosphere with hundreds of visitors everywhere. Some young adult pandas were able to be viewed in trees, providing realistic images of their lives. They were, however, a fair distance from the perimeter",
          "The pandas are ever so cute, but oh so lazy. In fact so lazy that they will not hunt for food. They eat 12 hours a day, sleep for 10 and play for two. Once they are done eating, well forget about it, they will lie down with their backs towards you. Forget about getting any",
          "Pandas are cute and it's a must visit in Chengdu but this place seriously needs some crowd control. We went there early in the morning and it was already crowded with people (mainly tours). There were lines at the entrance but people were actually queuing up. We thought they",
          "I've been planning to come to China and everyone asked me why...my one word answer...\"panda's!\" This place was wonderful. So many panda's roaming,eating, laying, playing! It's not like zoo's whrre they have two pandas and they are aleeping the whole time. No this has many many",
          "I was there during Golden Week meaning it was incredibly busy, but the staff managed the crowds well and limited the numbers that could enter the enclosures at any one time. If possible though don't go during Chinese holidays! Was very interesting to see how the pandas live in",
          "I have always loved pandas since I was a child. To be able to watch these animals at such close proximity was a real treat. There is also a viewing window for the babies which was great and rightly the staff usher people through this area to keep things flowing. The setting here",
          "You have the choice of a long walk/hike up the road/trails or you can take the much easier golf carts for a fee. I recommend the golf carts if you have limited time or not very active. The walks can be long or the weather can be a little rainy. The pandas are hard to predict,",
          "The grounds are beautiful, well-maintained. The pandas are so cute. It gets very crowded so go early if you can. The directions on some of the signs can be misleading so expect to get lost! Take the shuttle to the top of the park and meander down. We took a taxi from Chengdu to",
          "Absolutely amazing. It can get crowded and the nursery is packed uncomfortably with too many people. If you have the option, go as early as possible. The pandas are more active when it is cool in the early morning and there are less out people to compete with.",
          "As part of our trip to China we visited the Panda research Facility in Chengdu and what a wonderful experience it is to get up close with the Pandas. one thing, there were very large crowds on the day we were day, as they were showing off the recently new born pandas - but it",
          "Also a must if you visit Chengdu. The pandas are amazing. The place is very well laid out. Clean and tidy. Didn't need a tour guide at all.",
          "This was the highlight of our trip. What an incredible experience to see these beautiful animals. We could have spent much longer here",
          "I went there on a Sunday at noon thinking it would be extremely crowded but I was happily surprised with EVERYTHING. I made my own way by metro to Panda Ave station (less than $1) followed by a quick yellow shuttle bus (Hi-Panda) at an astronomical cost of 2 yuan. You buy your",
          "There were too many visitors at the time I was there, which kind of dampens the experience. But the pandas were so cute!",
          "there were far to many people visiting this place we were told they only have 20,000 people in one day they all must go in the morning, as this is the time our tour went there as most other tour groups I would imagine, trying to get there first. It was hectic from the start and",
          "The facility covers many acres and is home to about 80 Giant Pandas as well as the smaller red pandas. There can be extensive walking, but there is also a shuttle bus route. We were there on a misty day - apparently ideal panda weather - and saw many of the bears reasonably",
          "I was super excited to do this and it was worth it! It was really easy to get to - take the metro to Panda Avenue and there is a bus right outside that takes you to the park. The bus is free and you can buy entry tickets from the guides on the bus (This is legit). Don't bother",
          "a remarkable place, enabling viewing of the pandas in a caring, healthful and beautiful environment. wandering through the extensive leafy park, there are a variety of enclosures and great information. great to know that the ultimate objective is not only to save the population",
          "We visited the Giant Panda Breeding Base and it was one of the highlights of my visit to China. To see the Panda's in such close proximity and in such a near to natural environment with lots of space and climbing frames was totally amazing. The Panda's do appear to be content",
          "As of this review, I visited the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base twice; once on a weekday, another on a Sunday. There is a noticeable difference in crowd size during the weekend and would definitely return on a weekday. It's also worthwhile to visit as early as possible, at",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to China was to be able to see giant pandas of all ages as well as red pandas. We visited the week after the October holiday and it was fine for crowds. We saw 2 week old pandas with their carer, adult pandas eating (and being gradually covered",
          "Over 180 Pandas in one spot makes this a must see attraction. Lots of walking and stairs could be challenging for some and the nursery is very crowded. Great photo opportunities.",
          "Giant Pandas are reduced to around 2200 in the wild, all in Sichuan Province. Our guide outlined that pandas sleep for 15 hours a day, have the anatomy of a carnivore though their diet has evolved to be bamboo which they are only 20% efficient at digesting. So he said we should",
          "Thankfully our SNA guide was aware of all the pathways and we were able to see lots of pandas even though we didn't arrive until about 9am. The place is packed with people as you would expect and there are the inevitable really busy places where baby pandas are on display along",
          "Great experience and lots of walking - great panda experience - loved them now. Hopefully, less pushing and cutting on line in the newborn baby panda section.",
          "This place is great, the lay out, the enclosures and the park itself but the amount of people take away from the experience. We got there when it opened and left by 1pm as the crowds were too intense. You literally were aggressively pushed and elbowed to get to the front to see",
          "Surprised at how close to the city centre this research station is.It is one of the must see features in China. The pandas appear to be very well looked after and healthy. They are in fairly large enclosures and do not appear to be upset at all at their situation. They take vey",
          "A great place to visit if you want to see lots of Pandas. We only saw two babies and they were asleep, but the 'teenagers' were fun. We went early in the morning so that we had more chance of seeing active Pandas. Most were either eating or sleeping, but we did get to see the",
          "Went early to beat the crowds and i was well worth it. By mid morning the visitors were flooding in. Loved seeing the pandas and learning about them, Well worth the special trip to Chengdu on its own merit. Had a fabulous day (and the sun shone all day to make it even more",
          "Our Giant Panda experience was amazing how can you not love them. Our Wendy Wu private Tour Guide Libby was excellent spoke very good English and made our experience 5 star\ud83d\ude0dwould do this again in a heartbeat loved it \ud83d\ude0d",
          "We had a great visit here. Would love to have more time to spend here. Great photos and very exciting to see the pandas in more of their natural habitat.",
          "Done easily in 2 to 3 hours. Just reach here before 9am (or earlier) if you want to see the pandas doing more than sleeping! Feeding time from 8 to 9 generally. Very young/baby pandas are out at 10am at both nurseries. Red pandas still active and eating at 11am. New born baby",
          "We visited the research centre at 9 am and were part of a volunteer program to assist panda keepers clean out roam areas and pens for the pandas. This takes about 1.5 hours and then you are treated to a walk around to see the other pandas varying in age from 1 year to 19 years.",
          "Once in a lifetime trip to see the Giant Pandas, they didn't disappoint. On the advice of our local guide we got there early in the morning,so they were outside feeding. What a lovely place very well maintained and to see the baby Pandas in the nursery was truly emotional.",
          "Go early ! See the feeding .. else just see the big fellas sleeping ... Toilet cleanliness. Excellent",
          "We were lucky as the weather was overcast and it had been raining, just the sort of weather pandas love. They were all outside rather than being inside and getting the feel it was more like a zoo. In addition to the pandas nibbling away on their bamboo sticks, you can also see",
          "I just love pandas. This research centre is the best place in the whole world to see pandas of every age in their daily life. I travelled to the centre by taxi. It cost 80 yuan or about $15.00 Canadian one way. My hotel was very close to Tianfu Square in downtown Chengdu.",
          "Easy access by public transport and taxis. Lots of taxis outside the park to catch a return trip back to the city. Start early as Panda's are awake and active then. They really are so adorable and cute. Also, going early would avoid crowds and allows you to enjoy the Pandas and",
          "China Discovery (based in Chengdu) showed us a wonderful time! Our group of four included three seniors. So we wanted a trip tailored to our interests and physical capacities. Tour consultant Ashley He patiently worked with us to build our reasonably priced and interesting",
          "Very clean and serene place. The pandas seem well taken care of and happy. You will see lots of pandas lounging about in trees. We saw a few active pandas rolling about.",
          "Well worth the visit, you get to see the giant pandas and lots of them, the babies and red pandas as well.. the park is pristine and well looked after and you can see that they genuinely care for the pandas as they are in great condition",
          "If you are in Chengdu, this is a place you must go. The Gov't has put a lot of funding and effort in the preservation of this endangered species. It is evident here how much research, care, and education is being done for the Giant Panda. Go early in the day for lighter crowds,",
          "We went what we thought was \"first thing in the morning\", arrived around 10AM. Is a bit confusing getting the bus from Panda Avenue metro station, if you don't speak Chinese, but we got it in the end (the bus price includes the entry fee, which is good). We got there in time to",
          "The gardens are stunningly ng and the pandas have nice leafy enclosures. It is lovely to se them moving around, which is possible in cooler weather. There is an area for red pandas too and the nursery may have babies lying in cots. It is a great spot to spend a few hours.",
          "Our trip to Chengdu was exciting, wonderful and truly would go back there in a heartbeat. Our hotel was exceptional along with our excellent tour guide who meet all our expectations.",
          "Whilst it was crowded given that it was the national holiday week we thoroughly enjoyed or visit and experience visiting the Panda \ud83d\udc3c Research Station. A magnificent experience",
          "Beautiful reserved with many Panda's to enjoy. We had a bonus with three week old baby Panda's. Very exciting",
          "Easy access to the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base from Chengdu . Not too crowded in the early morning. Saw the cute pandas of all ages in their consigned parks. The younger ones were quite active whereas the older ones stay mostly sedentary. They love embracing themselves to",
          "A fantastic day spent here walking through the large forest and seeing these magnificent creatures up close. Best to get there in the morning, as by midday it\u2019s busy. Great that they have a breeding facility to care for these wonderful bears.",
          "What a trip. Its what everyone goes to Chengdu for. The earlier you get there the better as this is very popular. It just makes you want to go home with extra luggage.",
          "Amazing weather in September and the place was so serene and green and extremely clean. Seen a lot of pandas, even the 2 months old in their nursery. Great walking paths, well maintained public areas and amazing conservation efforts doen by the teams! Absolutely loved it",
          "well if you go to Chengdu your only there to see the panda's and its well worth it, yes its busy but to see them doing what they do best, eat and sleep its the place to go, when we visited there 2 four month old cubs could be seen, beautiful..",
          "One of the best stops on our tour by far. The exhibits are very open and the Pandas dont feel caged at all. The nursery with the baby Pandas was very cute. We went back a few times because we couldnt get enough. The entire complex has a great open feel to it and you can tell",
          "We were fascinated by the thousands of visitors and the order the staff controlled the crowds.The pandas were beatifull and we were lucky to see a baby panda as well. A must visit place.",
          "Lots of opportunities to see these amazing creatures! Some of them are sleeping of course, because they do a lot of that, but we were able to see some eating (their favorite thing), and some were playing. We visited in September and the line to see the baby pandas was very",
          "We arrived at 7:15, fifteen minutes before the base opened. The taxi ride from downtown Chengdu was only a 30 minute journey and cost less than 100 rmb, so we would recommend doing the same rather than faff with buses/tours. Arriving early was essential, as we had heard all the",
          "I was not really sure I wanted to go here, but it was one of the best trips on our vacation. We were lucky that it was not too hot and there were not as many people as I had read there could be. The animals were plentiful and playful. The Pandas got food at different times so",
          "I have not been here for 17 years. In the interval many of the problems with Panda breeding and nutrition have been resolved. My hat is off to the diligence of the local scientists. The Panda population has grown substantially. Of course the critters are cute and pictures for",
          "I went mid September, on a public holiday. However there was torrential rain so it wasn't very busy at all. But the rain meant, as a group of 10 of us, we only got to go to the two nurseries. We did see a large group of 3 year olds, mother and pair of cubs, and several babies",
          "great place to visit, however is very crowded (albeit school holidays when we visited), thoroughly enjoyed",
          "The two of us visited the Research Base at 8am, which was a great time to come, as both the red pandas and black and white pandas had just been given their breakfast and visitors could see them all very easily. The crowds which came later seemed to be handled very efficiently by",
          "The location is quite far from downtown but easily reachable. Good to see funny panda. Try to see the baby panda. They are very funny during breeding time. Visit there during winter season however area full with tourists.",
          "The site is very interesting if you've compassion for animals. They give very comprehensive details of pandas\u2019 care and breeding, history. Must go in morning to view more of them in outdoor. Also check and don't go during china school or public holidays to prevent crowd & queue.",
          "This was the highlight of my China trip. Dont miss chengdu if you are visiting china. I could have stayed the full day just watching these pandas playing. They were amazing and very very cute. You will not see anything like this in the world.",
          "Highly recommend, if you are to Chengdu it must go to one of the pandas facilities, and this one although little bit crowded it is still a big facility with easy access through metro and shoutels, and again highly recommend experience. Tips try to visit in middle week when it",
          "We went as part of a tour, got to see some pandas, was very crowded, shuttle carts mixed with crowds not ideal, very little English explanations, so did not learn a lot. I believe there was educational areas which we did not see.",
          "We visited the Breeding Research Base as part of a tour. Actually, this was the only reason we chose to go to Chengdu, and we weren't disappointed. We didn't get there first thing, which is the best time because the pandas are most active early when they are eating. But we",
          "The park is beautiful and well kept. Thousands of visitors everyday and no litter. But the pandas are the show. Big ones, little ones and even red ones. A great place for young and older to see pandas. Very nice wide walking trails to go through the park. It was very hot when I",
          "We travelled here on a trip organised by Buffalo Tours and it was a great experience. We arrived very early and were inside the grounds by 8am, it was already very busy but not so much that you couldn't see the Pandas. There are approx 165 Pandas there and we saw some in every",
          "The Panda Research Centre in Chengdu is simply fantastic. Get there early, it opens at 7.30am. The Pandas are fed first thing in the morning so that's when they are most active. By 11.30am the crowds were really large so we were ready to leave. Saw over 60 Pandas and a",
          "No doubt that everyone will visit here, just try to arrive in the morning, so you can avoid line up and also can see active Kong-Fun panda, instead of sleeping \ud83d\udc3c",
          "Very few Pandas hidden from the crowd. is not more than a zoo, but only with Pandas. Crowded, to the point that was impossible to take a picture.",
          "They are the cutest and most adorable animals I\u2019ve ever seen. The staff seemed very happy looking after them, as if they treated them as their own family.",
          "You pretty much HAVE to go if you're in Chengdu, like hitting the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I saw a panda in San Diego years before... for me, it was enough. But it's the panda-region pilgrimage. Nice grounds, well marked, very clean, lots of people--not a lot of eating options",
          "Interesting to see how research was done to preserve the panda population. From conception till adult, all is explained. To go in the mornings to see how they wake up and eat. Very nice experience!,",
          "Hiw cute and funny are those animals! Visiting the pandas is something you must do if you come to China. Go there in the early morning, as it becomes too crowded afterwards and, furthermore, the pandas are brought inside as it gets too hot. Unfortunately, you will meet hundreds",
          "You will have the opportunity to see a lot of pandas, from small little babies, toddlers, teenagers to grown up old men trying to push each other out of trees. The much smaller, not-related red panda is also there. Wear comfortable shoes as this is a hilly area with lots of",
          "If you are a fan of pandas then you definitely want to pay this place a visit. It was definitely crowded, but there were a lot of exhibits which gives you an opportunity to walk around and see many different pandas. The red panda exhibit is an added bonus as they are very fun",
          "Had been panda keeper volunteers a couple of days before at Dujiangyan Base which I really enjoyed, but for me you cannot see enough pandas. We travelled to the base by metro and bus, arriving early. Entry was free by showing my passport, I think for over 60's. Was much",
          "We went during Summer holiday and it was packed. Wasnt the best experience due to the numbers of people. Great possibly during off peak or during winter when bears are more active. They chill out in the heat",
          "We had a great time walking about the Panda base - it was really a once in a lifetime experience - suggested to go early morning to avoid the mass amount of groups coming later",
          "We caught a taxi from our hotel to get to the base as it opened. This is suggested as the pandas are more lively in the morning while it\u2019s cooler, and the crowds grow throughout the day. We expected to be almost the only people in the park but we were wrong! Not completely",
          "I think possibly if you\u2019ve seen pandas before, you could skip this. If it\u2019s your first time seeing pandas, it\u2019s pretty cool. That\u2019s basically all you do is look at pandas. They\u2019re not very lively animals, so not especially entertaining. Glad I went but not a must see.",
          "This place is absolutely crazy busy and noisy with people ignoring the flash photography signs left right and centre but the pandas are incredible to see so close up and looking very happy too. I had a great time here, my advice is to get in the queue to see the baby pandas",
          "We enjoyed this but really it was too busy and too hot to properly enjoy the experience. We saw the baby pandas but it was only for a couple of minutes. Preferred Wolong Panda centre as we had more quality time with the pandas.",
          "We really enjoyed this as there were several Panda enclosures. It is very crowded during the Summer holidays but we went early so we could leave by midday.",
          "This was a crazy experience, it seemed like half of Chengdu was visiting the research center, absolutely packed with people elbowing their way along the paths- we saw three giant pandas in a glassed in enclosure and two red pandas in an outdoor exhibit. There was plenty of",
          "I am happy to see the pandas in such a peaceful place, dedicated to ensure the survival of the very beautiful and peaceful pandas. They and many others suffer from our polluting and cultivating more and more of their places of habitation.",
          "Very nice place, a opportunity for see the pandas and a good start for a wonderful trip. Lovely moment. It was very nice to see them in their natural habitat",
          "Certainly one of the hottest spots to visit. We left downtown at 7 am and arrived 7:40. Already very crowded. Long waiting time at the main spots and very loud guards pushing people with megaphones - even it is everywhere stated pls be silent... Happy to see the Panda\u2019s",
          "The title says it all - go early in the morning for the most panda activity - crowds can be a bit daunting",
          "Giant pandas, baby giant panda, giant panda teenagers(?) and even red pandas. You can get a good view of the animals and enjoy lovely grounds with paved walkways and a guided tour tram. Plenty of panda gear for sale. Panda mania!",
          "I would have given this review 5/5 if it wasn't for the amount of people visiting. The park itself is beautiful and seeing the pandas was simply amazing. Crowd control is non existent and can get very claustrophobic.",
          "We learnt our lesson from visiting other tourist spots and reach the panda research base at 7am. Online reports that the centre opens at 7:30am. When we reach, there was already a queue to buy tickets and to enter the gates! We have to jog up slope in order to ensure that we",
          "The complex is very well organised and the Panda enclosures are well set up. There are many Pandas to see, from young adolescents through to mature animals, and also new borns in the nursery. Like most attractions in China, the complex is very busy but we were still able to",
          "First and most important, BE THERE EARLY! Instead of having breakfast at the hotel, have a Jian Bing from one of the vendors outside the park. They accept cash, and ATMs are outside. When inside, go straight to the pandas , since they are more active the earlier in the",
          "This was one of our must do items in China and it was such a fantastic experience to see the Pandas. We were fortunate to see new born cubs and the the rempreture was just perfect for the Pandas to be at their most active. We also saw the cute lesser Panda. Unfortunately it was",
          "We went in August during summer break on a Saturday. It was wall to wall people. The pandas were active and you could certainly see them in spite of the crowds, but the number of people was mind boggling. I was also at this attraction in October 2017 during the week. There",
          "Got there around 8:30am and there was no queuing system what so ever. Was unsure where to get tickets from. Everyone was pushing in front of us. When getting closer to the front we were told we were in the wrong 'que' and had to go and que elsewhere. When eventually making it to",
          "I would recommend visiting A) in term time, not school break B) winter so the pandas are outside It's cool. The museum is good too. It's a big park and I would visit again when less busy.",
          "Don't come on a holiday weekend!! It was insanely crowded when I came during the Chinese Tomb Sweeping Day. I felt lucky to see the pandas at all with all the pushing and shoving going on. Opening hours of the Base are 7:30am to 6pm April through October and 8am to 5:30pm",
          "What a unique place, the only place in the world that you can see Pandas in their natural habitats, see baby pandas be nursed, and Panda cubs as they grow. This place is very, very busy, so get there as early as possible (it opens at 7am) and be prepared to spend a lot of time",
          "Pandas have always been one of my favorite animals, and getting to see such a diverse range of them in one area was a dream come true. Even when all they do is eat bamboo, you will have trouble taking your eyes off them!! When I first heard of the Research Base I had some",
          "I was really impressed about this special zoo. Important is to go and visit it in the morning from 7.30 am to 11.00 am. Too many people having the same idea to visit the park. Anyhow it is great.",
          "We took the subway to the Panda Avenue Station, where we took the special bus to go to the Panda Base (price: 2 RMB one way). You can also buy admission tickets for the panda base at the bus station but a friend had already bought our tickets online. At the bus station we",
          "I have no idea what I was expecting, but it wasnt just a zoo with only pandas. It makes sense looking back, but why dont people just say it's a panda zoo? It's cool, the pandas are cute. But it's just a zoo.",
          "It's easy from \"downtown\"/ Tianfu square by public bus - first a bus to the Zoo stop - there you make a transfer to bus nr 87 or bus nr 198 directly to the Panda Breeding Base :) the trip takes about 80-90 minutes! Ask in your hotel reception/ the concierge for Panda-tickets",
          "We spent a morning here. Arrived at 8.05 am and it was already very busy with large queues of lots of people with pre paid tickets! Despite the crowds we still saw lots of pandas and watched them for a long time. - all very cute! It was a bit of a scrum to see the younger pandas",
          "It was awesome to bring my little child with us to visit this magnificent park of panda it was really fun",
          "Get there early morning to see the pandas, nice place to spend a couple hours, can get easily crowded.",
          "Although I hate to admit it, this was the highlight of my visit to Chengdu with my tour group. However, I never anticipated the massive crowds of people who come to see the pandas. While the park is huge, we only did a small section of it and went to see the newborns which you",
          "My bad but I was thinking we were going to interact with the pandas. That site is apparently about 2 hours away from Chengdu, in the mountains where the pandas live. At this site, you get to see the pandas interact (go in the morning when they aren't so sleepy) and it's cute",
          "If you love animals do not support animal abuse in tourism. If you want to see reserve it is not this place! If you want to have just perfect photo of panda... Small cages are perfect for it. This place welcomes thousands of tourists every day. Pandas are closed in small",
          "Went on a Sunday to see the pandas - get there early!! It gets busier the later it is. Make sure to make it through the whole area, there are sections with more pandas in the back. They will be outside if it is cool enough, another reason to go in the morning!",
          "My family visited there on June 21. It\u2019s great place in Chengdu. Everything were pleasant and lovely. All Pandas and red Pandas were cute. According to our travel guide\u2019s arrangement, our early morning visiting time was very convenient due to summer time temperature and many",
          "For all Chengdu has to offer, the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is certainly among the most worthwhile destinations. Simply incredible.",
          "People waiting for hours to get a 2 second glimpse of a 3-inch newborn. Crowds 10 deep and it it is 98 degrees at 8:30am. This is a must-see but you must be prepared for lots and lots of gawkers. I still cannot figure out why we humans find everything about pandas cute and",
          "You can see 2 different kinds of Pandas, the \u201anormal\u2018 black-white and the less known red Pandas. The Great Pandas (black-white) have newly borns, some days/weeks old, young and adult animals (status: Middle July 2019). Nice is, that you can also see the new born little Pandas,",
          "We spent the whole morning watching the giant pandas, and also saw the one-month old baby pandas in the incubators. Although it was very crowded, we were able to view the pandas up close - a great experience! There are also many red pandas to see as well in a different",
          "An overcast day but best touring weather to see all different ages of panda bears with Lisa Liu from Wendy Wu Tours. Crowds everywhere as expected but they move freely so you can get great photos of the pandas. We saw a panda baby - one week old with no fur to younger twin",
          "Fabulous, fantastic. Guide and driver perfect. A dream come true to come and see the pandas. Will be back !!!",
          "If you can at all help it, don\u2019t go on a weekend or holiday. Get there as early as you can. We arrived around 8:40 and it was already super busy. We were still able to get up front with some patience, but the Saturday crowds were already pretty intense. By the time we left",
          "We had a private tour of grounds very busy so guide was very helpful. These animals are so lovely to watch. Grounds are clean and animals well kept lots of walking.",
          "At the behest of many travel blogs we arrived at the park at 830am to find long lines to buy tickets and enter. Luckily things move pretty quickly and we were glad we got there when we did since we were able to see 3 panda's wrestling with each other for about 30 minutes. Once",
          "great experience and i am seeing panda for the first time,making the day more special.good and clean place. Our travel guide ms.LUCY was very helpful and friendly",
          "Seeing more than just two pandas was what really attracted us to visiting the base. On a July morning, we did see what we wanted to see but man, was the park crowded. So many people, so few space... this therefor is a been there done that for us.",
          "Very clean and well organized. Everything is clearly marked with signs so this beautiful park is easily navigated.",
          "This is my 3rd time to this place. First time here in the summer so really felt the heat and humidity this time. For the giant panda paddocks, they have a few scattered around. To be honest, if you\u2019ve seen one I don\u2019t really see a point in seeing the others especially when it\u2019s",
          "This visit gave me a very good idea about the pandas. The film from the BBC in the tourist center was perfect",
          "I have been there but the indication for nit Chinese people was not very clear. Tickets very cheap Better to go when is not too hot or the Pandas prefer to stay indoor.",
          "Nice place to actually see and learn about Pandas. The worst part are the LOUD Chinese who tend to diminish my enjoyment when there are large numbers... they talk so loudly, talk even louder on their phones instead of enjoying the park and smoke when there are no smoking signs",
          "Probably main reason for most tourists coming to Chengdu. Pandas galore and as cute as can be. Nicely laid out facility with lots of different enclosures and loads of cute Pandas Skip the line for the shuttle bus - it\u2019s not far to walk and much quicker than lining up for the",
          "Our tour group arrived reasonably early at the panda base & the crowds were not too bad. The weather was perfect for panda viewing - overcast & cooler than it had been. All the pandas were out & about eating breakfast. The younger ones were playing with mum. They were comical to",
          "Awesome place to be with family with kids.we thoroughly enjoyed our journey with seeing different sizes of Pandas. We were quite late due to flight delay. Result was most of the pandas were tired and sleeping. Then also we had few awesome moments.",
          "We got to the centre around 8am- opens at 730am. Was not too busy and no line up at ticket booth. Price is around 54RMB for adult. It is a very large centre and you can either walk or get a shuttle. The shuttle line up was huge (ginormous by lunch time) so highly recommend",
          "Our guide took us early in the morning so we can see the Pandas enjoying their breakfast of bamboo shoots. After the breakfast at around 10am they go to sleep!!! What a life?",
          "Great to see so many panda (small and big) at a single area.. All different action from every single one of them..",
          "Everybody visiting chengdu must go see the pandas! It\u2019s an amazing experience and it\u2019s great to see these beauties! Defiantly better to go first thing otherwise any later you risk them all being asleep, as they sleep after food.",
          "Everyone who visits Chengdu should visit the pandas, best early in the morning when the pandas are more active. We visited on a rainy day but this did not spoil the experience with plenty to see at a bargain entry fee, had the weather been better we would have also enjoyed the",
          "the chengdu panda base is located outside the city but was very easy to get to by public transport. The metro is easy to navigate and buy tickets for and goes as far as \"panda avenue \" station and from there there are buses to take you to the entrance. We spent around 3 hours",
          "It was very enjoyable to see both red and giant pandas and learn about the conservation effort. I highly recommend seeing both the BBC film showed at many locations around the park and the Chinese film at the \"cinema\". They put everything in context and the visit gets more",
          "Yes, I was equally thrilled and charmed by the giant pandas and you are able to read thousands of reviews by others that concentrate on cute & cuddly. I knew that I should go in the morning to see the maximum number of animals and to avoid the crowds. So my review concentrates",
          "This Panda Reserve has a ton of pandas and all with different personalities! It was hard not to think of them as animals only because their antics appeared to be intended to entertain onlookers. Pandas by nature, I was told, are lazy, humorous, and seem to operate well in small",
          "As part of our group Tour of China we had a visit to this attraction. Unfortunately our visit was on a Saturday which meant that the site was extremely busy. Nevertheless we enjoyed our visit. It has to be done!",
          "Every tourist should visit it! its a huge park, with so many different pandas! i was there already 3 times!",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is very nice! It is clean and the exhibits for the animals are spacious and well-designed. We didn't get to see babies but the pandas are all ADORABLE and hilarious! I could have watched them in awe for hours! Go in the morning before it",
          "I listened to every review saying that you should go early in the morning, because that time pandas are the most active. I was there about 8:30. It wasn't that crowded as for China(it was Wednesday after all). There were a lot of places with pandas playing with each other, as",
          "The pandas are always fun to watch - but beware of crowds. Don't go on the weekend and go early. In one area one of the staff was trying to help a young panda out of a tree and it felt like Times Square on New Years Eve. Lunch here is adequate. Don't miss the \"red pandas\"",
          "This was one of the highlights of my entire trip to China! If possible go early and on a cool day for the most activity. The centre is bigger than I expected and we spent all day. I wish the food vendors didn't close so early, but otherwise it was great. The dedicated bus from",
          "I advise you go early in the day to see the pandas. They are fed early and apparently sleep much of the rest of the day. We caught them as they were fed and they were wide awake and even playful. The red pandas were very cute, so be sure not to miss them!",
          "We went with a tour group to see the pandas. Our tickets were arranged prior to our visit. We arrived at 7:45 and virtually walked straight in. Pandas were very active at that time. We saw the young pandas frolicking around. We were told their activity stops about 10 or 11. So",
          "The Chengdu Panda Breeding station is spread out over a large area. Older tourists may prefer to take a ride by bus to the top of the hill where you can watch the Pandas in natural surroundings. However we were unable to see the baby pandas as the nurseries were inaccessible. We",
          "The park is as breathtaking as the Pandas. Go early to beat the crowds and see the Pandas being fed. Very well designed to keep Pandas and offers a great experience to the public.",
          "This is a place which is easy to access for panda sighting as it is located by Chengdu city, suitable for those who has less time,otherwise Wolong should be the first option. This base is also well known as a birding place in Chengdu city.",
          "I took the metro to Panda Avenue on Line 3. I arrived before 7am so you can take a taxi/grab and you might see other tourists that you can share the ride with, take a public bus (I believe bus 87, 198 or 198A but verify) or walk which I did about 4.3 kilometers. I arrived at the",
          "Loved visiting the pandas, there were more than we expected and they were easy to see. The sanctuary is well maintained and very clean. Recommend this place very much.",
          "We had a wonderful guide for this. His name is Haba Yefei. He has been to the Breeding Base many times. He told us we needed to arrive by 7:30, so we did. The pandas get up early to feed. They don't like the heat, so they go in to sleep after their breakfast. Also, it gets",
          "Tip: get their for opening time! And don\u2019t join the line for the bus around the park, the walk isn\u2019t that far and you\u2019ll get to the pandas faster than the crowds. This place is really great, definitely worth a visit!!",
          "Highly recommend. Great to do with kids. Excellent experience viewing pandas. Take a taxi and getting around inside is very easy.",
          "First of all, the enclosures are big and spacious and afford great views of the pandas for everyone. The grounds are beautiful and well kept with walkways through gorgeous bamboo forests and trees. Prepare to do a lot of walking and wade through crowds of people. Push your way",
          "It was wonderful to see the pandas. We visited as soon as they opened as I believe this is when the pandas are most active. We saw lots and got never to be repeated photos. Don't forget to keep checking the trees, its amazing how such large animals can climb so high without",
          "If you love pandas you have to check this place out. There are so many pandas here. It seems like almost all they do is eat and the signs around the place tell us that this is because their digestive systems sort of sucks and they need to eat so much to get a little bit of",
          "Visited the centre on Monday 0900 and was so crowded.. (good to go early as the later panda will stay indoors due to the heat) Decided to take the tram but long queue and ended up walking will be faster. Unfortunately baby pandas not in view as not the birth season. RED",
          "We came here in the morning just after 9 am with a group and it was getting busy. Large attractive park with nice lake and gardens, the pandas were easy to see as the weather was cooler and wet today. We saw the red panda too! There are about 200 pandas here and a total of 200",
          "Visited here early in the morning as the pandas are more active then, than than in the heat of the day. You are guaranteed to see pandas - the large ones which are kept in separate enclosures and younger ones 9up to 3 years) which share enclosures. How do we get baby pandas if",
          "Absolutely amazing centre, promoting the successful breeding of the Chinese Pandas, which is vital to the survival of this species. Hit and miss as to whether the pandas are active or asleep, but you are more or less guaranteed to see active pandas in on enclosure or another.",
          "I had a dream to be up and close to my beloved Panda Bears. To be a Panda Keeper for a day was a check on my bucket list. The facility was clean, the grounds well kept, and the Bears appeared to be happy. I recommend this facility if you want to be part of their care.",
          "Nice park-like facility. Lots of pandas out and about for breakfast. We enjoyed it! They even had red pandas!",
          "Cheapest place in city to see Pandas of different ages. Try to get there at open to minimize crowds and have best chance to see feedings. Leave exhibits and museums for later",
          "Seeing the pandas was one of my trip bucket list items. The park is huge and does get quite crowded, but the wide pathways are paved and comfortable for walking. Beware that there are golf cart shuttles that move people through the park. The drivers don't use horns but rather",
          "We flew into Chengdu Airport and went straight to the Panda Base so got there early. Just a tip, we hired an English speaking tour guide and a driver (its cheap and well worth it), who drove us there and guided us around the base. On entry, don't waste your time in the queue",
          "Wonderful visit. Make sure you have a guide who knows the way around the facility. They can take you where there are not any crowds or at least less people since it can be very crowded. Start lining up at least 30 minutes before opening time to avoid waiting in line for a",
          "Beautiful grounds, very clean, and the pandas. If you are into pandas this is the place to come and see them!",
          "This is the place to see the pandas! I have been here twice in the past four years and both times it was remarkable. Definitely get there early before it gets crowded. It is not too far from the city. The paths are lovely to walk along with the bamboo. Be prepared to walk a bit,",
          "Love pandas ! They are amazingly adorable and cuties. Start early in the morning to avoid the crowd and the pandas are all out and active and playful in the morning . Loved watching all the Kungfu pandas. Take the shuttle .",
          "We visited on our own for about half a day. You don't really need a costly tour. We asked our hotel to call a cab to take us there. It cost only about 60RMB on the meter and we were there in about half an hour. I was unsure if I wanted to go there because I am not a fan of",
          "For me, this is the top attraction in Chengdu (& my second visit to the Research Base). What can you say? It's Pandas! I'd suggest going early in the day as 1) the crowds haven't gotten crushing and 2) the pandas are active. The red pandas are not to be missed. Take a picnic",
          "I mean who doesn't love panda's right? We went here on a sunny day which was perfect. You stroll around all the different sights and just have an amazing day. I guess we were lucky too, as the panda's were super active and played around with eachother. I've heard that some days",
          "This is a pretty big breeding facility and a lot of the pandas are in outside enclosures. The park can get crowded plus the pandas are apparently most active in the morning. So it's best to go early in the day, they open at 7:30 and we got there around that time and there was",
          "What\u2019s not to love about Pandas?? We spent a wonderful three hours wandering around on a tour and, at the start, were not quite sure what to expect (and being non-lovers of zoos). Once through \u2018passport control\u2019 \ud83d\ude0a, we were very pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the",
          "It might be cheating to ask people how their experience of being with Pandas all day went. Our group of 6 had a fantastic visit to the Breeding Center, where we did a few hours of work cleaning the animal enclosures and preparing some of their food. Our reward was being able to",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit, and to see pandas up close. We saw about 15 different pandas at various ages. We're told that they have around 70 pandas at this complex. The entire place is set up in an attractive park-like setting.",
          "How can you not give 5 stars to these wonderful creatures? However tiny, however large, they are all cute! Incredibly lazy, lolling around in the branches of trees and just eating and eating! Super visit and plenty of room for everyone.",
          "It was a great place for my nuns. They had great service and were very kind. SIS, THIS WAS IT. <3 Sister Nunibun",
          "Me and my nuns loved it. It was fun and cool and expensive but it was worth it. Love: Nun power sister",
          "On a rainy day we saw a lot of very active Pandas, best place to be in china. Beside the big pandas also 3 small ones",
          "If you are unable to see giant pandas in the wild, visiting this breeding centre is the next best thing. The pandas are housed outside in very spacious areas and as they are quite lazy they spend most of the day lazing up on the trees. The guide advised us that giant pandas",
          "We unfortunately coincided with a bank holiday weekend but it was still nice to visit. The pandas are in a number of enclosures - some are solitary and mature, 'teenagers' are in enclosures of 2-3 and can be quite funny but the gems are the baby ones who just clamber all over",
          "We visited on the first day of the 4 day May Day holidays and it was very crowded. Nevertheless there were officials insisting people keep moving so it worked quite well. There were many pandas out and they were very cute, with three young ones having quite a game together.",
          "Park is close to Chengdu. Easy to visit by taxi (40RMB). Go early (08.00 AM) when panda`s are still active. In the park everything is in walking distance. Don`t join the endless cue for the transport vehicles in the park.",
          "Fortunately the forecasted rain never materialized during our 2-hour self-guided walking tour. We had a wonderful, memorable visit to this unique park. Taxi from our hotel for the 40-min ride to reach here around 8 cost 87 RMB. Admission at 55 RMB/US$8 is a super bargain",
          "The park itself is a nice facility, though the signage is a 6/10 and could be improved. BIG PROBLEM is they over sold the entrance tickets by ten-fold they day we visited. Panda Park comfortably holds maybe 5,000 at a time but they allowed in about 15,000. Park was dangerously",
          "What a great and rewarding experience this was. Lots of beautiful panda all very happy and well looked after. Definitely worth the visit",
          "The red pandas have a large enclosure where they can wander through the trees, cross the path to the other side, walk up hills and over logs, so lots of enrichment. The keepers put some kind of squash out for them, and they loved eating it which was fun for us to watch. And",
          "I was really pleasantly surprised by how nice this place is. The pandas are such beautiful creatures. The park is clean, easily accessible and the pandas seem to be treated really well.",
          "Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. You have to squeeze through the crowd in order to get a glimpse of the pandas. It is a pain especially this time of the year when the weather is so humid for both pandas and visitors.",
          "Seeing the pandas in a natural environment and learning about the efforts made every day to preserve this species is a highly rewarding experience recommended to all Chengdu visitors.",
          "Now, I DO love pandas, like so many others! But we only went because our friend's wife (who was looking after us) was insistent we should see pandas. It wasn't a huge crowd there, but as the day was warm, all the pandas were inside, and that's where everyone gathers. So, you",
          "Easy to get to with subway line 3, stop at Panda Avenue. Bought ticket at the exit of the subway including 15 min bus transfer for 54 RMB each. That included the return. Free lockers for luggage are available in the tourist centre after the entrance if needed. We went early",
          "Although it opens at 7:30am, get there around 7am to buy tickets and stand in line, as the crowds are unbearable. Once inside skip the tour trolley and speed walk to the panda enclosures. Be prepared to walk, as the base is huge. I recommend visiting the baby pandas first, as",
          "We did this on our own (not really worth paying for a guided tour). Easy to take a taxi there (or public transport) and pay the entrance fee. It's like a zoo for just pandas (this is not the place where you can hold the pandas). There are various enclosures where the pandas are",
          "Definitely go in the morning 9-11 this is when they are eating and playing, after that time they lye around and digest the bamboo. Also we were warned not to go in the summer as they don't like the heat and are fairly dormant. Very nice setting, about 27 Pandas of various ages",
          "Go between 8-10 when they are eating, otherwise they may be sleeping. Also, be prepared to WALK! The area is hugh and spread out!",
          "The purpose of our trip to Chengdu was to see Pandas and this did not disappoint! We arrived by taxi at 7:25, tried to purchase tickets from the machine but they do not accept UK cards or cash so had to queue up at the ticket desk. At 7:30 the desks opened and it was a free",
          "Chengdu is not the easiest place to get to or the best city in China, but I would go again and again and again if I could. The research base is immaculate and you will never walk away saying I wish I could have seen more pandas. We were advised to get there right at opening",
          "I visited the place many years ago. Since then the place has been hugely expanded. The old areas near the front are mostly empty. Most of the pandas are kept in the new areas at the rear. When one visits this place, one should look for the baby pandas as they are cute and",
          "We took the subway from Chunxi Road line 3 to Panda avenue. This took about 20 minutes. We left at 7am because; as most people have stated; you want to get there early. Subway was not crowded at that time of morning and only cost 4y each. When we got to Panda avenue the shuttle",
          "Not only do you see Giant Panda in all stages of development (depends a little on the season), there are beautiful gardens and lakes to wander through. The science of the panda museum should no be missed.",
          "Nice and clean center. We saw around 30 Panda\u2019s. If you like Panda\u2019s then I recommend coming here. We spend 9 days tracking around China and this was my least favorite city. Saying that if you want to see them, come here. Lovely park, nice enclosures and pretty flower garden. We",
          "Beautiful place. Very big grounds. Take the bus if you have trouble walking long distances. But the line for the bus takes forever. Pandas are cute as ever but stinky and they don't do anything. My fav was the red pandas. This place fills up fast. I would suggest going early",
          "The Panda's were wonderful. As everyone says, get there early when it opens. We didn't use the shuttle and had a plan of what we wanted to see before it got busy. The park itself it beautiful to walk around and enjoy. We bought our tickets on the Klook app and it made it so easy",
          "Since an early age have dreamt of seeing pandas in the wild. Well this is the nearest to it. So many adult and babies in large, green open spaces doing what they do- not a lot! They spend a lot of time sleeping and eating and moving slowly around. Some were climbing trees,",
          "It's an unique place to appreciate lovely pandas with natural surroundings.As we all konwn, panda is the national treasure of China, there you can not only learn local culture but also get more recognitive knowledge towards the protection of extinct animals. In a nutshell, its a",
          "You don\u2019t need a tour to visit this place. We arranged private transportation for 7 of us. Those who are over 60 do not need to pay entrance fee - just show your passports. Our hotel concierge advised us to go early as the pandas are active in the morning. April was",
          "Lovely concept and beautiful park but ruined by the sea of selfie sticks and crowds. Go on a day with \"bad\" weather as the pandas will be more active and there will be less tourists. Really nice park and surrounding areas, just the experience is ruined by the sheer number of",
          "Very green and the pandas seemed to have a lot of space. Sometimes other visitors would get in your way a little bit and some tour guide have loud microphones that sometimes scare the pandas. I\u2019d never seen so many pandas in one day. Try to get there in the morning so you can",
          "A must see when in China! The place to see giant pandas and they didn\u2019t disappoint. Make sure you get there super early - they open most days at 7:30 - as pandas are most active in the morning and crowds get unbearable after 10a or so. Avoid weekends and holidays if at all",
          "I only have 48 hrs in the city and managed a four hour afternoon visit to this wonderful place . About 45 minutes from my hotel , the place was full of tourist , well organized , the tickets and entrance very simple to handle. 6 of us choose to walk instead of taking the tram",
          "I love pandas and I got to see over thirty of them while at this park-like research base. I found the open enclosures so nice for the pandas and tourist and that the pandas seemed to really like their areas too.",
          "This is such a beautiful lush vast amazing park with heaps an heaps of pandas in a cool jungle setting I saw heaps of pandas playing,eating, wrestling , climbing and sleeping it was such an amazing experience and the base also has great facts and information on the pandas and is",
          "The research base is huge, like the pandas themselves. A very efficient mixture of research facilities and visiting facilities. And the pandas: sleepy monuments, they even look tired of so much sleeping.",
          "A very popular place with tourists and locals alike.Arrive early for 2 reasons,1...try to avoid the major crowds 2...pandas are most active mornings and late afternoon. You will get a lot of non moving,sleeping pandas if you are here at lunchtime.The surroundings are quite",
          "We came to see thePandas and we were not disappointed. They came out to play and it was awesome. This is a very very busy tourist destination but the crowds sort of moved along at a reasonable pace. It was a very enjoyable day.",
          "A trip to the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is a must for anyone traveling to Chengdu, especially nature lovers. The Giant Pandas are unique and the research facility offers ample opportunity to learn about this magnificent animal. Most zoological parks throughout China",
          "Very enjoyable but not different from a zoo for panda's. Seem like a happy place for them. If you want to see babies, check ahead of time if there are any new borns.",
          "Wonderful atmosphere with around 120 pandas at different ages. From huge giants to months old little pandas you can see all.",
          "Our daughter has always been a panda loving so coming to Chengdu was a no brainer. The base was large with lots of panda areas, they also had red pandas, and peacocks running around. A wonderful way to spend a few hours! It was only a 30RMB taxi ride to the base AND when you",
          "Early morning is the best time , when they get feeded, because they are active then, otherwise the sleep all day long. So best time is between 7 in the morning and 9 pm",
          "Seeing pandas is always fun and although you can't get that close to them it was still a treat to see them. The center itself is easy to get around although was very crowded when we visited at the weekend. Naturally pandas are more active at different times of the day and I",
          "The reason we went to Chengdu was to see the pandas. We were not disappointed. We do not agree with zoos as such but this is the facility on the planet that is pulling out all the stops to save these wonderful creatures. We were entranced by the antics of these bears in an",
          "We arrived early and saw many many Pandas before the crowds arrived. The red pandas were very special to see too. Don't bother to wait in line for the shuttle bus. Its a great walk around the park and you get to see many pandas that you wouldn't otherwise see. The pandas",
          "Very big parc with a lot Panda\u2019s. Worth spending half a day to see all parts as during the walk they will all be or sleeping or eating or playing. The most funny was the place at the far end of the park where small panda\u2019s were playing and fighting while mum was eating :)",
          "On a weekday in April, we arrived at opening time and had the park to ourselves for an hour to watch the pandas feed. After 10AM, it begins to get incredibly busy. The opening hours say 8AM, but the park actually opens at 7:30...it's definitely worth waking up early to avoid the",
          "No matter when you visit it will be busy. Our guide wanted us there early and when we got there -- just at the 8am opening time -- it was clear that this was the right move. Even at opening time there were queues already lined up. Probably shouldn't give away the secret,",
          "Our group of 9 paid to be \"keepers for the day\". We cleaned the enclosure and got to see the bears up close through the bars of the cages. We were left for several hours to explore the center. Without a guide giving us some background, we were uninformed about the efforts of the",
          "A large hillside, so a nice place to amble around. Very busy with both Chinese and foreign tourists but still got to watch giant pandas and red pandas eating and playing. Well worth a visit.",
          "The pandas are as adorable as you\u2019d imagine and were much livelier than we expected. We arrived before the park opened and joined a small queue for tickets. The park opened at 7.30 and we joined the queue for the shuttle bus. We left it after about ten minutes as the kiosk",
          "This park is overcrowded on weekends and the number of visitors should be regulated. Instructions and explanations are in Chinese language, some being translated. Signs and directions are confusing. The bear areas are not too well maintained. Because of this we couldn\u2019t find the",
          "We came to Chengdu to see pandas, and boy did we ever! We loved seeing them in their beautiful habitat. Zoos and other animal establishments often make me feel a little sad, but not here The animals were all very well cared for, with natural like enclosures, which were kept",
          "I loved my visit to the Panda Research Base. Loads of pandas to see in a natural environment and lots of information about the breeding programme. The highlight was seeing a baby panda that was a matter of days old in the incubator!",
          "Other reviews are accurate about arriving early to see the cubs playing around their breakfast time and to avoid big crowds. We visited without a guide and without pre-booking and found it all very easy. Our easy travel advice: Travel by metro line 3 to Panda Avenue (15 -",
          "While most pandas were eating, one of the younger ones seemed to get great joy from tickling himself/herself. It is wonderful to watch all these beautiful, peaceful animals.",
          "Even though there were lots of people this was a fun place and very exciting to see the pandas. Loved it. Lots of shade in the heat of the day.",
          "I arranged a stop over in Chengdu in route to Bangkok to visit this centre. We arrived by Taxi at 8am. There were queues outside the base and hoardes of people already crossing out the prime places to see the pandas. The attendants did not monitor the lenght of time people were",
          "Must do if you\u2019re in Chengdu! The site is easily accessible via public transport. You can get a taxi but I would save your money for more souvenirs. There are multiple buses and the metro to Chengdu Zoo, then change to bus 198 towards the Research Base, which stops outside.",
          "As expected, the base was crowded even on a weekday. Upon entering the base, we saw a long line of visitors waiting for battery-powered shuttle cars. There are only eight cars with each carrying 14 passengers. No wonder the line was so long. Our guide estimated that the waiting",
          "This is a research and breeding center for giant Pandas and red Pandas. It has a zoo like feel. There is a lot walking and hills. Our group paid extra to take the shuttle to the top of the hill and then work our way down. There were a lot of people and school groups when we got",
          "As everyone says, get there early. You don't need an English guide, don't waste your money. Big tourist sites like this in China have reasonable English signs and maps. Take the Metro to Panda avenue, buy a ticket for the yellow bus and ride it to the site. Expect a lot of",
          "Arrived early to the research center and beat the crowds. We were able to see the cubs and the adults as they feed in the morning and are more active. I would recommend getting there around 8:00 am because the park is mostly empty and you can see many of the enclosures before",
          "You can get very close to the pandas and watch them eat and roll around. You can spend hours here or get it over with quick. I would suggest going early and beating the packs of native tourists and all of the schools. Early early in the morning!",
          "Our guide Haba told us before hand that to see the Pandas in action we must reach early. We reached little late, by 9.30 and the babies had finished their breakfast! Nevertheless, we saw some of the grown ups in action - chewing bamboo, playing with others ....... Apart from the",
          "We arrived at about 9 as part of a small English tour party. Our guide was able to ask staff where the active pandas were so we were able to see quite a few pandas including one group of 6 eating. A few were sleeping in the trees. If you do not have a guide look for the crowds.",
          "The panda centre is open at 7.30, and I was there at 8.30. The crowds rolled in around 10.30 and then viewing the pandas was extremely difficult. Early on I had my choice of prime positions for photos of the gorgeous creatures, all dutifully munching on their bamboo cones. There",
          "The panda breeding and research centre give you ample opportunity to observe the pandas in natural enclosures. The pandas can be seen on platforms, in trees and on the ground. When we were there we saw a couple of pandas eating bamboo which was very cute. The facility also has",
          "Adult tickets cost us 52RMB each through CTrip. Children under 7 are free and half price for those under 18 years. Incredible value for money. English guides can be hired but are unnecessary due to all the signs being bilingual (great translation). It's busy but well",
          "We walked the entire park, and saw one panda through the window. Granted that was nice, but we expected more. The park itself is a bit of a trek to get to, and there is much walking to get through it. Perhaps the weather impacts panda viewing? This was in May.",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is one of top 3 places to visit in Chengdu. The Pandas are fantastic!!!",
          "All I can say is that you will really want to take one home. They are so much fun to watch and the place is quite well organized.",
          "Giant Park. Must see! Specially good for families and children. Must arrive early morning to see best of Pandas. Afternoon Pandas like to take naps. For best experience early arrival recommended!",
          "I stayed at Shangri-la Hotel great place and we had the concigere arrange a cab to Giant Panda Breeding Research Base it was truly a high light of my trip. Will take my family someday there because I believe it was truly worth it.",
          "Clearly the highlight in visiting this part of China. We stayed in the center of Chengdu at the St. Regis Hotel, and everyone told us to book a private tour for $80-$100 per person. Totally unnecessary. We took a taxi both ways, bought our tickets at the research center and the",
          "We visited city of Chengdu on a business trip and we had some time to visit Panda breeding center. We bought tickets by our hotel on Chunxi Road from Panda tour buses that included a drive to the center plus a ticket and a drive back to Chunxi Road. When we arrived at the",
          "As others have advised, go early in the morning before the beasts are plum tuckered out from consuming tonnes of bamboo. Indeed, watching them eat has to be the purpose of the trip! The centre is accessible by bus but if the budget affords, taxis are plentiful.",
          "Placed right at the top of chengdu ,parking an issue ,so get taxi much better.55 yuan to get in about \u00a35 each ,try and get there before 9 am as the pandas sometimes go bed at 10 am, great park LOVLEY bamboo walks , take a pic nic too. But the pandas are amazing , as must to go",
          "This place was really well done and exceeded my expectations for a zoo in China. We could have stayed the whole day here. We arrived at about 8am and the pandas were all busy eating their bamboo breakfast. A million picture opportunities. It is clean. Restrooms were also",
          "I went with Tour China , our guide was wonderful we got to see the pandas eating and the 14 babies at the facility. Our guide new the best times to bring us for both the Giant and Red pandas to get the best experience. If you love these creatures, I highly recommend going to",
          "We visited the PBRB in December at around 9:00 am. The timing was perfect as we had unimpeded views of all the pandas, across all ages, having breakfast. Most enjoyable and a heartwarming experience. I was shown photographs of the Base during the high season. How anyone could",
          "As background, my family visited the Chengdu Field Research Centre for Giant Pandas (near Dujiangyan) in 2017. While we had a nice experience there, I would say that this place was more impressive. Upon arrival, I wasn\u2019t expecting much \u2014 likely because it is so close to the",
          "I just love the research base. Educating people about the protection of pandas and how to preserve their existence. I\u2019m not a big fan of playing with animals and taking their pictures and don\u2019t necessarily agree with that but overall a good learning experience.",
          "we went on Thursday, not so crowded. the area is very big, lots of walking but can see many pandas so worth it.",
          "Long-story short, it's a special experience by any measure, just for the privilege of getting to see real live Pandas. Great on many levels: animal lovers will be happy to them, and in clean good quality quality environment, families with kids will find it most entertaining,",
          "A visit to the giant panda was the highlight of my time in China. These magnificent creatures were wonderful to watch. Who knew they could climb trees. Visitors can also view the red panda. Well worth the trip. Arrive early to avoid the crowds.",
          "It was a bit disappointed when we go all the way to the sanctuary to see the panda, at the end, we only manage to see a small number of panda in the air con room with a long wait for more than 45 mins, nothing in the wild on that day. Not worth the 1 hour ride to go there.",
          "Everything was brilliant for me. I have been here for a couple months as a trip. It was so lovely city.",
          "Highly recommend a visit if you are in Chengdu! Beautiful facility to view pandas up close! Closer than any zoo! (and I\u2019ve seen them in Washington DC and San Diego)",
          "Got the chance to go during a winter weekday, so the crowd was manageable. I did the whole tour in 2 hours, with using the little train to go back to the entrance (very cheap). All the pandas were outside, and easily spotted. Just go to where the crowd is, because this is where",
          "I have been three times to the Panda Base, so becoming somewhat of a regular! The Panda Base is a beautiful spot and the only place in the world where you can see so many pandas. Yes, it's a zoo with only two different animals (giant pandas and red pandas) but you don't feel",
          "This is an amazing place to visit, well planned, cleaned and up close with the Pandas - make sure you go with your own tour guide - we used Haba - see my comment about his services.",
          "Though we had been to Chongqing zoo pandas this place is amazing. 180 Panda of various ages where on display. The place is well spread out, easy walking with plenty of toilets. We went in December when tourist numbers are low. Our guide Chris had us go early so we could be there",
          "We went at the end of January and I was afraid because in China some iconic places can be crowded super fast and early in the morning. This time we were lucky !! We were there around 9 - 9:30 because was panda\u2019s breakfast time. Wasn\u2019t too much people so we have plenary of time",
          "Get there early-- the crowds are a REAL thing. The place is huge, so wear comfy shoes. They sell food & snacks in the park, so don't be afraid to spend a whole morning wandering & do lunch here. There are quite a few habitats, and the lake is a stunner. But like, don't try to",
          "A great place to see the giant panda & red panda\u2019s. Go early. The panda\u2019s are active early in the morning & when they being feed. Walk to the top of the park & work your way back to the lake/ museum / entrance area. Great to see adult pandas, sub adults, young /yearlings. Easy",
          "Good experience for a half day trip. Since the weather was good, we could actually see soany pandas of different ages ranging from babues to sub adults and adults. Apparently we saw them during their lunch time\ud83d\ude05 because we saw pandas having lunch in groups as if they were a",
          "Have been 3 times now, and it is getting g better each time. MUST go early if u want to see the Bears moving. They eat early and then sleep all day!",
          "Lots of pandas here, and quite affordable. We paid $8 USD a person to enter the park, and the taxi was around $8 each way from the center of the city which was about a 30 min ride. I definitely recommend heading there in the morning when the pandas are feeding and the most",
          "The most amazing place to see Pandas up close and personal! A great open park full of nature! It was amazing seeing the pandas so close! It\u2019s a huge park and there is a mini train to get around if you don\u2019t want to walk. I would recommend to anyone who is visiting the area! It\u2019s",
          "On a cold January weekday morning (we arrived about 08:30) we saw absolutely loads of pandas up close as it was feeding time - amazing experience and brilliant photo opportunities!! However by the time we left (around 11am), even though it was off season and a weekday the park",

          "The research center was well planned and with reasonable and pleasant walk, you can access all the facilities. It was off season so we could enjoy seeing panda from decent angles. There are different age groups of pandas and they are lovely to watch than we originally thought.",
          "This is one of the best attractions in Chengdu and strongly advising people to visit the place if you are there. Kids loved the visit and we were able to witness more than 20 pandas during the trip. Unfortunately did not come across any baby Panda's as most of them were at least",
          "A lot of Pandas, we especially enjoyed the young pandas (teenage I guess) they are very active and fun when they first get out and to their bamboo breakfast afterwards they just lie around so it pays to go early (first thing in the morning). Panda cubs where really cute, we got",
          "The Centre was well set out, great views of Pandas (lots of them), about 10 young Pandas in a nursery/creche. The tour guide was informative and made sure we could see it all. The trip was part of a Pandemonium add-on tour of our Webjet/Travel Asia Holiday.",
          "Probably one of the reasons you are in Chengdu is to visit this great facility. I was surprised how built up the suburbs are in the immediate vicinity, but once inside the park, it is wonderfully landscaped and you get to the the pandas in a variety of enclosures. It can get",
          "On a snowy morning it was very picturesque to watch the pandas at play and eating. As it was cold many were curled up asleep though and the nursery wasn\u2019t open. The grounds are beautifully kept, peaceful and lush and everything is we\u2019ll signposted. Cheap shuttle buses transfer",
          "Our visit exceeded our expectations. We followed the advice of other travelers to be there when it opens at 7:30am because the pandas are active in the morning only. Our hotel told us it opens only at 9 and fortunately we didn't believe them since the reviews and website says",
          "After seeing Hong Kong, Beijing and Xiamen. We had arranged through recommendation a tour guide for 2 days in Chengdu. Yoyo, a Chengdu local with over 10 years tour guide experience both from in China and all over Europe, met us at the airport and she exceeded any and all",
          "The big day had dawned.... the day we were so eagerly looking forward to and perhaps the main reason for our visit to China -- to see the giant pandas. Here we were in Chengdu on a cold, rainy morning, up and ready to visit the giant pandas with fingers freezing and we pulling",
          "Saw many giant pandas in naturalized surroundings. The exhibits were well organized. Took a motorized transport to the top of the hill and walked down back to the entrance, which was helpful.",
          "Amazing half day with the cute pandas! My husband and I spent a few hours here looking at the super cute pandas eating and playing. There is quite a lot of walking involved, but it was a cold and cloudy morning, so we didn't mind the extra work out to keep us warm :-) definitely",
          "Fantastic experience, so much information and a lovely environment . We had a great local guide who was very knowledgeable and we had a relaxed leisurely tour. Taking a leaf out of the Pandas book, everything is very slow, a truly amazing and worthwhile visit.",
          "I just visited the Panda Research Base for the second time. I loved seeing the baby pandas. I went on a cold winter weekday morning so it wasn\u2019t too crowded. I suggest taking the shuttle bus up to the top of the park and then walking down unless you have a ton of energy. There",
          "Learn a lot of information about panda through this visit. Though I must say winter might not be the best time to visit as you might not be able to see baby panda",
          "This was my first visit to the Breeding Research Base. We had a guide who introduced us to the history and pointed out the different pandas and their ages. It was a great learning experience to learn of the differences between the red pandas and the usual black and white ones.",
          "Its the best place to see Giant pandas and Red pandas both. Very closely you can see healthy and active pandas. Its a well managed place by Chinese Scientists and administration. Very clean and attractive compared to other countries. Can learn A-Z about pandas at this amazing",
          "Extremely crowded. Be patient to see the babies in the nursery. Walk along the pathways to see the Giant pandas in their habitat. Also saw red pandas. Was able to get many good pictures.",
          "We were part of a large group who visited the Centre in November. We caught the shuttle bus from the reception area. At first I thought it was going to be a case of sheer luck if we saw the pandas but once we had passed the first area, we saw lots of pandas at every point. They",
          "Enjoyed the education and the panda habitats. The service by the minibus/tram was excellent as there is a great deal of variation and walking/climbing. I saw it on Saturday pm and it was very busy. Lots of pandas as expected. If you are older/disabled probably not the best place",
          "Go during the weekday to beat the weekend crowd. This place is simple and kept up very well. Lots of pandas, easy to see/access.",
          "We visited Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding (Panda Park) by morning around 8.30 am in NOV 2018. We were lucky to spot nearly all the Pandas in the Park as it was winter season as Pandas were out in the Park.",
          "I read some reviews, ...so do your homework first, than go, to avoid dissapointment! 1. visits during summer makes no sense at all 2, go in the early morning and you can leave for lunch happy 3. take a bus for 55rmb included tickets from K~alley or the Metro to Panda avenue from",
          "My coworkers took me here during a business trip. I can say that it is a chance of a lifetime for most people to see so many pandas. Also, this is a rare opportunity to see baby pandas. The park layout is a not straightforward and it's easy to miss some of the enclosures. I",
          "An amazing experience to see these incredible creatures up close and personal We were lucky enough to have a close encounter with a baby panda even though it was only a ten second meeting This is a very exclusive experience that is hard to put into words but will be forever in",
          "Great place but make sure you go as early as possible. There's queues even before they open (730am), but it just gets worse as times goes on. Go early, walk quickly, be patient and don't forget to go and see the red pandas. So fantastic seeing pandas up close and playing around",

          "We arrived in Chengdu around lunch time and were able to join a 2pm tour to the panda research base. At this time we got to see a number of the adult pandas, but only one of the little babies. Most of the pandas were asleep or sleepy (still cute), though we got to see 2",
          "Does not matter if you are a tourist or here for business, you have to go there one time! there is no other place in the world where you can see so many pandas!!!",

          "Spent a full day at the centre and saw several giant pandas in habitats as natural as could be provided.You get the chance to be close to them and if you have patience to wait for a good spot because of queues,get great photos.There were also red pandas on show but not as",
          "We took a shuttle from the subway, which was included in the \u00a555 entrance ticket bought at the shuttle station. The shuttle station can be found just outside panda avenue subway station of line 3, the first shuttle leaves at 7:50. So we arrived at the Panda base at around 8:10",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is a wonderful place to see pandas of all ages and learn about their habits and habitat. The base is an imitation of the panda's natural habitat so you are surrounded by bamboo trees over 92 acres. This does not feel like a zoo - it feels",
          "We were there this morning. At one of the enclosures saw five very active giant pandas eat, climb up and down trees, chase after each other, and wrestle among themselves. One even fell off a tree because the branch couldn't hold its weight, and broke off. It was hillarious! The",
          "What an amazing facility. The facility is incredible and they do such a good job of taking care of the pandas. I got so many wonderful photos. If you are a bird watcher, there are also a lot of great birds there too.",

So glad we did as it was pleasantly \u2018quiet\u2019 and we were able to see pandas at our own leisure without having to jostle for space. They may be less active at this time but it really didn\u2019t bother us and we",

          "Apart from everything everybody can tell you about this wonderful huge mono zoo I was most impressed by the movie shown at the entrance ( and also a bit further in the park) We saw a giant panda feeling a bit restless and then - floop - the birth of a tiny pink sort of piglet.",

          "This was one of the highlights we had been looking forward to and we were not disappointed. We were in a group, but well organised by our tour guide who knew her way around and how to avoid the crowds. Nevertheless it is crowded in places and patience is needed to get the best",
          "Don't miss this attraction even without children. Great experience. Nevertheless, you should come early as you can. We came at 8:30 and we were able to enjoy ourselves. People that came at 10:00 complained that it was very crowded.",

          "This is really a must see when in Chengdu. As everyone else has said, it\u2019s brilliant to see pandas up close and in a semi - natural environment. We took a taxi (45rmb) from the city centre and arrived at 7.15am - already a queue forming. But the park is so large that you can",
          "Unfortunately we were there on a national holiday so it was VERY crowded. Even with the crowds it was worthwhile. We got to see pandas inter habitat. I have no idea how may are in there - but it is lots. I am not sure if my highlight was seeing an adult panda high in a tree, or",

          "We made a detour in our trip especially to see pandas and weren\u2019t disappointed. The research base is educational and entertaining, with opportunities to see areas such as the veterinary hospital, panda kitchen where meals are prepared as well as to view Giant and Red pandas in",
          "The Chengdu Goat Panda reserve is for excellence a place that you have to seem if you visit Chengdu. Great place to have fun with your family members and kids. Also to help to preserve the wild life diversity of Pandas in the world because the money you pay for the entrance go",
          "I came here during a visit to Chengdu and really enjoyed the morning. You walk through a lovely park with forests and there are many stops where you see pandas of different ages - adults, juveniles and small babies. I arrived soon after the opening and at first it was not so",
          "Yes, it is true that Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is more a ZOO than a nature park. And yes, it gets crowdy even on working days. BUT pandas are pandas. I honestly have no idea what it is about these animals which makes the experience special, but it worked. Though it is",
          "We came to Chengdu to see the GIANT PANDAS and we were NOT disappointed! This is a wonderful park spread over 500 acres. You can see it all on foot... or you can wait in line to catch the free electric shuttle cart...",
          "Highlight of our trip so far. Although this is much closer to a zoo than seeing animals in the wild it is still a very pleasant park and really the only way to see pandas. We preferred the juveniles that were in a larger parkland area than the enclosures for the adults but it",
          "We arrived before 10.00 to make sure we saw the Pandas while they were still active, but in fact at this time of year it doesn\u2019t reach the temperature at which they want to go indoors so there is plenty of activity much later. Even at this time though, there were crowds and",
          "Of course this is very nice to see, with appr. 140 panda's, amongst whom some unbelievably cute baby panda's (they sleep on their belly...) The park is quite large, but still tends to get (very) crowded. Two tips. First of all: go early. We were there at 7.15 hours. The park",
          "Went there this morning (Saturday) and we arrived at 7:45. By about 9:30 the place was heaving. Thankfully by that time we\u2019d already seen most of what we wanted to. Possibly quieter during the week but would still recommend an early start as this seems to be when they are",
          "Went in Monday mid afternoon. Only crowd was for the tram. Definitely needed to avoid a long uphill walk. Since we are all 60+ admission was free. Bring a real camera with a zoom lens instead of a phone if you want to fully capture panda cuteness.",
          "Go early to avoid the worst of the crowds. The pandas are very well cared for and we got to see the adult, teenage and baby giant pandas as well as the more energetic red pandas. Be there when it opens at 8am, 2-3 hours is more than enough time to explore the park",
          "Basically it is a zoo dedicated mainly to the giant panda, with a couple of difficult to see reds as well. Beautifully laid out in a park like setting. You get to see the nursery as well as older and adult pandas fairly close up. Compounds are excellent and large so don\u2019t let",

          "If you don't like crowds get there early. Our fabulous guide Peter made sure we were there by 8.00am to avoid long queues. Once inside you have the option of waiting for the small electric buggy or, much easier, just stroll along the paths to the enclosures. We were there early",
          "This place is incredible. It is kept largely natural and panda enclosures are spacious. We visited early in the morning when pandas were relatively active - eating and eating more. Some were jostling and playing. We didn\u2019t get to see new born pandas but i guess it\u2019s better to",
          "Never seen so many Pandas. I am not really a fan of zoos but the enclosures were not exactly cages. Very striking animals to say the least. It was a Saturday morning and raining but was really busy, which I guess is most days. It's quite a big place and the grounds are well",
          "If you are over 60 you get in free! Just bring your passport otherwise full price is 55 rmb and 27 rmb for student discount. Pay 10rmb to ride the shuttle and is well worth it.",
          "What a great place to visit if you love to see the gentle giants!! Pandas galore and so so cute! Love the cute pandas who thrilled the crowds in the open areas with their endless eating, climbing up the trees and basically just being their sweet selves! We went in the best",
          "Nice to see a million of Chinese wanting to see few pandas. Nice bamboo garden with no pandas. In summer all animals are hidden in the pavilions.",
          "We arrived at opening time and it really was worth the effort. We were the only ones watching the cubs in their enclosure before they were let out for their breakfast. There were a few more people when they were let out just after 8.00am but we could still see the pandas easily",
          "What an experience to visit with these cuties do up close and personal. So much worth it to hold them even if only s minute. Well maintained and organized facility. Great way to spend time in Chengdu.",
          "You can see pandas of various ages, up close. Go in the morning because they are the most active before 10am. You may need to wait a while, but eventually they'll do something fun, like climb a tree or wrestle with their buddies.",
          "Surprised by the amount of new buildings in Chengdu it is the Panda base is now in suburbia. The base is nicely laided out and there are red pandas and golden pheasants to observe as well,",
          "There is a short walk to the first enclosure and the tour round takes you from the adults, past the teenagers and finally to the cutest infants you will ever see! We were very lucky with the weather and temperature (22 deg) so all were out eating, climbing and playing.....a",
          "Lovely to see the pandas in a fairly natural setting. We saw a range of pandas from 4 days old to fully mature. We saw them swimming, playing, eating and sleeping. Great fun to watch. We also saw the unrelated red panda, very cute.",
          "My wife and i visited the panda research base and was fantastic thanks to our Wendy Wu guide who new what time was feeding and when babies were on show. We avoided the bigger crowds to a big extent and we were able to take some amazing photos and videos.",
          "China often gets a bad rep for their treatment of animals, but when it comes to their national treasure, they pull out all the stops. The facility is top notch. The enclosures are spacious, but you'll quickly feel a sense of claustrophobia with the amount of people. We visited",
          "I was lucky enough to be in a hotel near a metro station. I decided to try this method as it seemed as quick as a taxi. I paid my 4 yuan for my ticket, got off at Panda avenue, (All the station names are both in English and Chinese as well as how to buy a ticket- all very easy)",
          "Try and avoid weekends and public holidays, go early. If you are lucky a cooler overcast day you will see the 1 -2 yr olds at their active best, playing with each other or chasing their mum. There are big crowds but they move pretty quickly, so if you wait for a bit you can get",
          "Visiting the pandas is an obligatory thing to do when in Chengdu. I expected to see a few animals behind bars. What a surprise. This place really well laid out with areas set out so the pandas can roam around close to their wild environment. The baby pandas were a highlight. .",
          "We visited very early in the morning with the mist still present. No queues and few people there at that time. The pandas were busy eating bamboo and playing. Such charming playful mischievous animals. Captivating to watch. The baby pandas being reared were tiny and only",
          "The research base is about 30 minutes from the city centre. Highly recommend you get their at opening time, to beat the crowds and the pandas are more active in the mornings! Be prepared for a lot of walking, but you will find the Research Base well structured and easy to get",
          "I enjoyed the base a lot. I arrived at 9 am- metro line 3 to panda avenue , buy a ticket in the dedicated office upstairs then a free shuttle bid to the base. There is a fair bit of walking uphill once inside but it\u2019s worth it to see giant and red pandas in large open enclosures",
          "We were in a tour group...there is obviously a certain amount of walking to visit all the Pandas...but there are golf carts if mobility is limited. Always busy here , understandably...places to buy water nd good quality toilets. Also a restaurant on site called the Bamboo..very",
          "If you are in Chengdu you must visit this attraction. Take the metro to Panda Avenue Station (on the pink line.) After the metro station exit there was a shuttle bus operator where you could buy the admission ticket there and get a free shuttle to the base. That ended up",

          "I absolutely loved it but have to say it was too crowded. We were lucky we were brought there by a driver from our hotel and he skipped the queue often for us and taught us to be rude. Otherwise we probably still would be queuing there and don't think we would see ever anything.",
          "Made the trip to chengdu to see the pandas! After reading all the reviews we got a taxi out to the breeding base early in the morning. Arriving there just before 730am. The ticket booth opens at 730 so we got our tickets and didn\u2019t have to wait to long in line to get in. The",

          "The pandas are super cute, but prepare yourself for thousand of tourist :)) during summer the pandas can't stand the heat and will be kept inside a small cool room with air condition. Fighting with thousand of other people who also trying to take a photo and you will see the",
          "Well worth the visit - def good advice to go in the morning to see them breakfast on bamboo. It was busy but as it is is spread out did not feel too crowded - one didnt have to wait long to get to the viewing point. Very busy with school groups the day we went but not a problem.",

          "We visited early in the morning on a day that was cloudy and cooler so the Giant Pandas were very active. We saw many pandas. There were groups of three, some singles, a pair of twins that were given a quick bath and some injections by a caregiver and a set of 3 month old twins",
          "It is easily accessible using bus and taxi. There are tour buses which for around 50 yuan will drop you at the entrance of the Panda park from a metro station. However the public bus for 1 yuan would do the same. To enter the panda park it requires a ticket. There are concession",

          "Was on a work trip and finished relatively early on the last day (Friday), had read many other reviews and most people had advised that the early morning visit was better so as to avoid the crowds and see the pandas more active before they get fed. We had to leave work drop then",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom. The head of the Shu Han State in the Three Kingdoms period was seated in Huanglongxi, and for some time, the general government offices for Renshou, Pengshan, and Huayang counties were also located here.\nThe ancient town has preserved the Qing dynasty architectural style, as seen in the design of its streets, shops, and buildings.\n\n\n==== Chunxi Road ====\nLocated in the center of downtown Chengdu, Chunxi Road (\u6625\u7199\u8def) is a trendy and bustling commercial strip with a long history.

A museum dedicated to the memorial of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was built in 2010.\n\n\n==== Luodai Historic Town ====\nLuodai was built, like many historic structures in the area, during the period of the Three Kingdoms. According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China. Three or four hundred years ago, a group of Hakka people moved to Luodai from coastal cities. It has since grown into the largest community for Hakka people.\n\n\n==== Du Fu Thatched Cottage ====\nChinese name \u675c\u752b\u8349\u5802,24 acre, at the western outskirts of Chengdu, adjacent to the Huanhua Xi (Flower Rinsing Creek).

      "name": "Dujiangyan Irrigation System",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Dujiangyan (Chinese: \u90fd\u6c5f\u5830; pinyin: D\u016bji\u0101ngy\u00e0n) is an ancient irrigation system in Dujiangyan City, Sichuan, China. Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system's infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan basin and the Tibetan plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. Li Bing, then governor of Shu for the state of Qin, and his son headed the construction of the Dujiangyan, which harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over 5,300 square kilometres (2,000 sq mi) of land in the region. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the \"three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\n\nDuring the Warring States period, people who lived along the banks of the Min River were plagued by annual flooding. Qin governor, irrigation engineer, and hydrologist Li Bing investigated the problem and discovered that the river was swelled by fast flowing spring melt-water from the local mountains that burst the banks when it reached the slow moving and heavily silted stretch below.One solution would have been to build a dam but Li Bing had also been charged with keeping the waterway open for military vessels to supply troops on the frontier, so instead he proposed to construct an artificial levee to redirect a portion of the river's flow and then to cut a channel through Mount Yulei to discharge the excess water upon the dry Chengdu Plain beyond.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nLi Bing received 100,000 taels of silver for the project from King Zhao of Qin and set to work with a team said to number tens of thousands. The levee was constructed from long sausage-shaped baskets of woven bamboo filled with stones known as Zhulong held in place by wooden tripods known as Macha. The construction of a water-diversion levee resembling a fish's mouth took four years to complete.Cutting the channel proved to be a far greater problem, as the tools available to Li Bing at the time, before gunpowder was invented, could not penetrate the hard rock of the mountain, so he used a combination of fire and water to heat and cool the rocks until they cracked and could be removed. After eight years of work, a 20-metre-wide (66 ft) channel had been gouged through the mountain.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\nAfter the system was finished, no more floods occurred. The irrigation made Sichuan the most productive agricultural region in China. On the east side of Dujiangyan, people built a shrine in remembrance of Li Bing.\nLi Bing's construction is also credited with giving the people of the region a laid-back attitude to life; by eliminating disaster and ensuring a regular and bountiful harvest, it has left them with plenty of free time.In 2000, Dujiangyan became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today it has become a major tourist attraction in Sichuan.\n\n\n=== 2008 Sichuan earthquake ===\n\nOn May 12, 2008 a massive earthquake struck a vast portion of west Sichuan, including the Dujiangyan area. Initial reports indicated that the Yuzui Levee was cracked but not severely damaged. Diversion of flow could still be seen as the river turns.\n\n\n== Engineering Constructions ==\n\n\n=== Irrigation Head ===\nLi Bing's Irrigation System consists of three main constructions that work in harmony with one another to ensure against flooding and keep the fields well supplied with water:\nThe Yuzui or Fish Mouth Levee, named for its conical head that is said to resemble the mouth of a fish, is the key part of Li Bing's construction. It is an artificial levee that divides the water into inner and outer streams. The inner stream is deep and narrow, while the outer stream is relatively shallow but wide. This special structure ensures that the inner stream carries approximately 60% of the river's flow into the irrigation system during dry season. While during flood, this amount decreases to 40% to protect the people from flooding. The outer stream drains away the rest, flushing out much of the silt and sediment.The Feishayan or Flying Sand Weir has a 200 m-wide opening that connects the inner and outer streams. This ensures against flooding by allowing the natural swirling flow of the water to drain out excess water from the inner to the outer stream. The swirl also drains out silt and sediment that failed to go into the outer stream. A modern reinforced concrete weir has replaced Li Bing's original weighted bamboo baskets.The Baopingkou or Bottle-Neck Channel, which Li Bing gouged through the mountain, is the final part of the system. The channel distributes the water to the farmlands in the Chengdu Plain, whilst the narrow entrance, that gives it its name, works as a check gate, creating the whirlpool flow that carries away the excess water over Flying Sand Fence, to ensure against flooding.\n\n\n=== Anlan Suspension Bridge ===\nAnlan or Couple's Bridge spans the full width of the river connecting the artificial island to both banks and is known as one of the Five Ancient Bridges of China. Li Bing's original Zhupu Bridge only spanned the inner stream connecting the levee to the foot of Mount Yulei. This was replaced in the Song Dynasty by Pingshi Bridge which burned down during the wars that marked the end of the Ming Dynasty.In 1803 during the Qing Dynasty a local man named He Xiande and his wife proposed the construction of a replacement, made of wooden plates and bamboo handrails, to span both streams and this was nicknamed Couple's Bridge in their honour. This was demolished in the 1970s and replaced by a modern bridge.\n\n\n== Temple Sites ==\n\n\n=== Two Kings Temple ===\n\nErwang or Two Kings Temple is on the bank of the river at the foot of Mount Yulei. The original Wangdi Temple built in memory of an ancient Shu king was moved, so locals renamed the temple here in honour of Li Bing and his legendary son whom they had posthumously promoted to kings.The 10,072 m2 Qing Dynasty wooden complex conforms to the traditional standard of temple design except that it does not follow a north-south axis. The main hall, which contains a modern statue of Li Bing, opens up onto a courtyard facing an opera stage. On Li Bing's traditional birthday, 24th day of the 7th month of the lunar calendar, local operas were performed for the public, and on Tomb Sweeping Day a Water Throwing Festival is held.\nThe rear hall contains a modern statue of the god Erlang Shen who was allegedly Li Bing's son, but historic records fail to confirm this and it is possible that he was invented by locals to give their hero a descendant to maintain his family heritage. Guanlantin Pavilion stands above the complex and is inscribed with wise words from Li Bing such as, When the river flows in zigzags, cut a straight channel; when the riverbed is wide and shallow, dig it deeper.\n\n\n=== Dragon-Taming Temple ===\n\nFulongguan or Dragon-Taming Temple in Lidui Park was founded in the third century in honour of Fan Changsheng. Following Li Bing's death a hall was established here in his honour and the temple was renamed to commemorate the dragon fighting legends that surrounded him. It is here that Erlang Shen, the legendary son of Li Bing, is said to have chained the dragon that he and his 7 friends had captured in an ambush at the River God Temple when it came to collect a human sacrifice. This action is said to have protected the region from floods ever since.During the East Han Dynasty a statue of Li Bing was placed in the river to monitor the water flow, with the level rising above his shoulders to indicate flood and falling beneath his calves to indicate drought. Recovered from the river in 1974 and placed on display in the main hall, this is the oldest known stone statue of a human in China.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLi Bing\nErlang Shen\nTurfan water system\nGrand Canal of China\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Came here after reading about this place on here, whilst the engineering is incredible and should be admired it's the scenery of the park that is where you really can take a time out and chill, make sure you go over the bridge up to the tower as the views are breath taking",
          "We visited here on our way to Mount QingCheng from Chengdu. We walked down to the irrigation system and paid for the bus trip to the end to view it at its furthest point. This was a very interesting piece of history to look at. We walked back through the gardens which were",
          "An 'irrigation system' doesn't sound too interesting BUT this was designed and built over 2000 years ago and links in with beautiful bridges and temples in the old walled city and a huge pagoda on the hill above the city. The diverted part of the river flows very fast through",

So many shops selling overpriced plastic tack, symptom of the \u2018made in",

          "I took the bus from Chengdu - it's very close and easy to organise if you go to Xinnanmen Bus Station. Buses go every 10 minutes. Go out the back of the bus station to buy a ticket - not inside the main building. The most interesting part is a long street that meanders up a hill",

          "The ancient town is more or less transformed into a tourist trap. Nothing really special about it. Things are quite pricey and vendors are unwilling to bargain. Souvenir items were 'modern' and tacky. From the food perspective, you can try the local grilled meat, yak products",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this street. It's a long walk from anywhere so worth getting a taxi there - it won't cost too much.  Night time is very cool because the lanterns get switched on.  There is also a street food market which was packed and a few nice bars.",

          "I enjoyed my visit here and it is a very easy to get do Monastery. Beautiful inside and very peaceful - as you would expect. No photos allowed in inside. Do go upstairs to see some of the rooms and get some lovely views. Gardens are nice to walk through. It wasn't that busy",
          "It's nothing special with this monastery compared to the hundreds others I've visited. It was a nice site to walk around. It was a free \"attraction\" which is a plus. I would not go back to this place. If you've been here once you've seen the \"site\" so to speak.",
          "Quite busy when we were there. Nice tea garden and several food options. Lovely grounds and beautiful old buildings. A pleasant morning diversion on our last day in Chengdu.",
          "Other people have said how busy this place is, but when I visited it was almost empty, especially when it began to rain! The temple itself is beautiful and very peaceful. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown. Entrance is free and there are some cool",
          "Look this place was hands down the best meal we had in china. And that is including the Peking duck we had in Beijing. We went here on a whim and the monks we so nice. We had some sort of white bun filled with mushrooms that literally blew my mind. Would suggest 12/10. We had",
          "Walking distance from downtown, free entrance ticket, some good sightseeing inside like the turtle pond, big garden and free tea. Outside the temple has many foods and snacks decent price",
          "Very busy place , but sooooo good try and get some fresh sugar cane drink from vender , yummy , free entry , , but take your time , investigate gardens and monestry,once you have finished there ,go to the market, but Do not pay first price , it's great to haggle and they expect",
          "A visit to this temple gives a deep insight into the culture of the country. Everything is very spacious and you can really do a little time travel.This place is located not so fare away from the down town area. The Ritz Carlton Hotel is about a 15-minute drive away & by taxi",
          "This place is gorgeous! There's the temple bit, yes, but the grounds themselves are the true standout. Very peaceful!",
          "There are many temples to visit in China. This one stood out by its beautiful setting, the harmony of the buildings, the good explanations and the overall tranquillity and peacefulness of the place",
          "I really enjoyed my visit, and walking around. They were very welcoming. It was peaceful and serene. I was with 2 cold small kids who wanted to leave the whole time. But it is beautiful.",
          "Behind the monastery is park where people practice tai-chi, and buddhist library. Next to the monastery is nice tea garden. Surrounded by lot of shops and tea shops. Free entry.",
          "Enjoyed the peace until a loud tour guide ruined the serenity. As many people were bowing, praying and lighting incense sticks it was a jarring note. The buildings and shrines are very impressive and gardens pretty. Springtime would be more beautiful I suspect. It was good to",
          "This place was walking distance from our hotel (BuddhaZen)... is a nice little monastery and park. Just strolling around you will see people practicing Tai Chi... elders chatting up. Worth a little relaxing time. Dont forget to eat at the restaurant opposite the main gate...",
          "Quiet monastery. Free entrance. You see monks and this area seems popular. Even for Chinese tourists. I recommend visiting the tea house",
          "Pretty and surrounded by nice gardens. Very peaceful. Not a must, but definitely take a look when in the area.",
          "This place has changed quite a fair bit since I came about 4-5 years ago. It used to be much bigger and quieter but it has now fenced off part of it for the monks and also for the teahouse/restaurant. Entrance is free and it gets more commercialized. The teahouse and",
          "The temple is one of Chengdu's main attractions. It is a modern monastery, but is filled with history and is a good place to get acquainted with Buddhism. It is a very easy to get there and wasn't crowded at all.",
          "Love my visit to wenshu and you can sense the energy and history in this place. Good for a one time visit and take many photos",
          "After visiting the Wneshu Monastery my hosts took me to the Tea Garden where we enjoyed different kinds of tea. the dinner was the best I tasted in Chengdu, and we visited a lot of nice dinner places I would have very much liked to return here! ...",
          "This is a modern monastery, but filled with history. Lots of constructions and cult spots that fill you will spiritual energy. It is one of Chengdu's main attractions.",
          "I would recommend to come here on a weekend, when the local families come and spend the day. It was such a pleasant stroll around the gardens watching locals doing tai chi, kids painting, families drinking tea. The tea house is great, especially if the weather is nice. One of",
          "An active site for worshippers, but I didn't find anything for non-Buddhists here. Large restaurant inside, and a pleasant garden. Can be skipped if your visit to Chengdu is brief.",
          "Not really our thing but a nice place nevertheless. Seems to be used by quite a few locals for prayer. Pleasant quick stop before lunch.",
          "I specially would like your point your attention to the vegetarian restaurant on the premises of this monastery. At night they have hot pot (very hot, if you don't take care!) and for lunch a buffet with a wonderful selection of vegetarian dishes. You can get some tea for",
          "The temple is nice enough, the gardens are serene and quiet, cool and green which is really nice. A fair bit of it is classic China fakery, fake old. The meeting hall thing in my photo looks like it's 500 years old but was built in 1999, it's only 19 years old. Overall a bit",
          "A nice temple with lovely park. Vital. Wonderful tea garden to relax and take some energy. Close to the city center",
          "One of the few ancient Monastery that I had visited worth the time and efforts lots to learn and enjoy",
          "Peace and tranquillity in the gardens of this monastery is what makes the visit worthwhile. The buildings are interesting as are the stunningly beautiful pagodas, the rock formations, fountains, ponds and the plants, trees and flowers are exquisite.",
          "I loved this place. It was very peaceful. You can smell the incense stick burning there but it is a very lovely smell. There is a tea place and a restaurant. The tea place is lovely. You can just sit down, have a tea, some Sichuan snacks and watch people and relax :) I also",
          "The monastery is beautiful and really worth a visit when you're in Chengdu. It takes about an hour to have a nice stroll around the premises, more if you want to have a quiet moment in the park (please note that there are lots of people). After that it's time to get walking and",
          "1. Is a quiet and peaceful place, worth to visit. 2. Very easy to find, nearby Metro station, walking distance. 3. Can spend for whole day at surrounding area.",
          "Free to look round - as always there were many 'worshippers' there and lots of incense. The pagoda next door is pretty and the tea house was probably worth a visit if you like tea. Posh shops in the adjacent street as well as stalls in side streets.",
          "This monastery was lovely to walk around early morning. Allowed a couple of hours. Lots of lovely streets around the monastery to explore as well.",
          "I enjoyed it here. The Monastry is tranquil and calming and the buildings are beautiful as well as the shrines.",
          "This monastery is not to be missed. I recommend going with a guide to get the most out of it, but even just a wander through would be worth it. Granted I haven\u2019t traveled much in Asia - ok hardly at all - but I think you\u2019d have to be pretty jaded not to be awed by this place.",
          "It was my second time to China and it was my first monastery visit! Nice place to see. There are some nice gardens all around.",
          "An interesting monastery but not much different from others we have scene. The art and statues are worth a look and a quiet place to wander round away from the crowds",
          "I went with the intention of sitting at the tea garden and people watch. That is what I did in the end. But, before that, I walked around the monastery and gardens. It was nice to see worshipers among the tourists. There's a nice walking path in the garden space left of the",
          "Great place to visit and understand the Buddhist culture. Very peaceful and relaxing. Nice to have some Chinese tea in the gardens.",
          "Worth a visit. The shopping area around it is wonderful to walk through and the monastery itself is serene and inspiring.",
          "It's a beautiful peaceful place where especially inside everyone seems to be quiet and enjoy the rest and thoughts you might get in such place",
          "Pretty much the only place in Chengdu, where I managed to get that peaceful feeling for just a little while. Chengdu is traffic, noise and people everywhere. But in Wenshu, everything slows down for a bit, even though you'll be sharing the experience with lots of locals.",
          "this is a park in the center of town, like most others in Chengdu, you can relax and just people watch, there are a lot of old buildings, but once you've seen one, they all tend to be about the same after unless you have some historic perspective.. You can download a wechat",
          "I spent a morning wandering around the Monastery. In addition to a number of statues and explanations, there is a nice Bonsai Garden. Pleasant to walk around and learn some history. You are right next to a replica old street with restaurants, shops and a couple of bars.",
          "Walking around the back of the Monastery you find these wonderful tall trees offering cool air and shade or relief from the drizzle. Interleaved with this park are some quite iconic old style Buddhist buildings. Good place to visit.",
          "Beautiful, relaxing, could have stayed all day. Will return again in the very near future. very easy to take metro-a short walk from station",
          "Worth visiting during the praying hours to sit back and listening to Buddhist monks' prayers. Calm and quiet and the ancient architecture and paintings will keep you busy for hours..",
          "This was my first time seeing a monastery and it was beautiful. The Turtle pond was adorable, the monks were mesmerizing as we were able to witness their praying ritual. Afterwards we ate at the vegiterian restaurant. The food was delicious and very affordable! In addition: it's",
          "was on professional trip to Chengdu and had the opportunity to travel to the monastery using the metro. the trip was very entertaining and the monastery was very peaceful and beautiful/",
          "Friendly ppl. Great selection of dishes in a sprawling monastery. Beautiful architecture and atmosphere. Very peaceful. Surrounding streets and area is good for walking around too.",
          "This is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours walking around and looking at the beautiful temples. We saw lots of animals including birds, cats and even a rabbit! The vegetarian restaurant was just next door to the temple entrance and it was amazing! We had struggled to",
          "Temple area located in a nice neighbourhood with well maintained streets, coffee and tea shops and pretty gardens. fascinating to watch the religious procession within the temple and walk through the gardens. A must do in Chengdu, a nice peaceful morning.",
          "Beautiful example of a typical Buddhist temple, very large with a number of smaller temples inside. It felt serene and calm, a must see in chengdu",
          "They serve vegetarian lunch at the temple for CNY5 pp. Proceed to the side hall where the \u201ckitchen\u201d is, take two bowl, chopstick and pay. One bowl for the rice and one for the veggies. Must clean your own bowl afterwards and return the bowl to the kitchen. We were late so we",
          "A beautiful and fascinating place to visit for an hour or two. It is just a typical Chinese Buddhist temple but has a very welcoming and tranquil atmosphere. It is an ancient place that still feels relevant today. Great food in the little restaurant too.",
          "Stayed closed to this monastery and really enjoyed taking a walk in their gardens. No entry fee. Great place to stretch legs after a long international flight. The various shrines are well worth seeing.",
          "Though not as ancient as some of the other Chinese Buddhist temple, this one stand out with impressive architecture, well preserved historical relics, active Buddhist teaching and service activities, but none of the aggressive commercialism at many other religious sites in",
          "We tried this restaurant one night and wanted to eat there every night from then on. The food is amazing, and for us vegetarians knowing we could eat anything on the menu was a bonus. The a la carte menu is upstairs and the staff speak a little English which is useful to",
          "How lovely to see this monastery being actively used by the community. Colorful and well maintained.",
          "We took a walk around the gardens and had a nice latte in the caf\u00e9, which was relaxing (it isn't easy to get a decent coffee in China so once we found here, we stayed a bit). Very beautiful temple structures and nice flowers/trees planted, the place is obviously taken care of.",
          "This was very interesting when explained by the guide. No English anywhere at all. Take tea next door in the lovely garden. This was opposite our hotel , Buddha Zen Hotel",
          "We went here with a private guide that was knowledgable on Buddhism... it was fantastic to learn lots of info on this religion while walking around the grounds. It is an active Monastery/Temple, so there will be people there to pray and such. They do not seem t mind you walking",
          "Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. It was built during the Tang Dynasty. The architecture is amazing. It contains abundant cultural relics and treasures. There are over 300 Buddhist statues made of varied materials. Many locals come here to",
          "Paid a quick visit to the temple after a full morning of visiting pandas. I don't have much to say about the temple itself, but the area outside the temple has quite a few shops selling souvenirs and other goods made by local artisans.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here and really loved this place. It was a highlight in Chengdu. Wenshu Monastery is home to about 80 monks and you can see them I the grounds as you walk around. It\u2019s a huge complex and there are various Buddha statues, different rooms, tea houses",
          "Old buildings, lots of locals, unfortunately our guide did not tell us too much about this place so we found it quite boring.",
          "Lots of history and such a special and spiritual place. I hope I can tap into the feelings of peacefulness I experienced there next time I feel the stress of life winding me up.",
          "Went for a morning walk and it was simply beautiful. Very peaceful and serene. Would highly recommend. Walked around the streets surrounding the monastery exploring the shops and picked up most of our gifts there. Loved it!",
          "Wenshuyuan is a big, green complex in the heart of busy Chengdu. I spent a solid hour wandering around, peering into the turtle pond, walking through the beautiful gardens and enjoying the gorgeous architecture. The tian shui mian restaurant across the street from the exit of",
          "This nice monastery is easily found by metro and a short walk. Besides beautiful temples it has an excellent Vegetarian/Vegan buffet and also a hot pot section, costs Y35. If you return your plate empty, a discount of Y5,- is given, an incentive against spilling food! The tea",
          "Located in the north of Chengdu town this temple complex is certainly worth the visit. We liked the peaceful atmostphere here. A beautiful garden too.",
          "Go and say hi to the Buddhist God. So peaceful and great monuments and temples. There is a pond with heaps of turtles. Close to subway. Dunno why it's called manjushri monastery on the outside?",
          "Despite being situated alongside Chengdu's busiest road, Renmin Road, Wenshu Yuan offers a little piece of peace in an otherwise bustling city. The site welcomes large numbers of (mostly Chinese) visitors, but the crowds tend to stay closer the the beautiful temple buildings,",
          "Wenshu Yuan charges no entrance fee, and they provide incense sticks for free, it is one of the least commercialized monasteries I have been. Very peaceful inside (of course when it is not too crowded), and they also have a little tea house & restaurant on the side.",
          "I spent the morning drinking pear juice and enjoying the peaceful quiet of this place. There are plenty of people walking around but it is very calm and tranquil and a great place to go if you need to get away from the busy city!",
          "This is a beautiful place of peacefulness and tradition If you like to visit temples this well worth seeing. many buildings to explore entry is free Their is also a tea house & vegetarian restaurant. mock meats mainly derived from mushrooms. Buddhist do not use garlic or onions",
          "A walk in the past at a reasonably large area 2-3 hours walkabout and entry is free. Just take the Line 1 Metro to Wenshu Monastery. Cheap half day away.",
          "An old amazing temple with many buildings to explore and some incredible jade Buddha from Burma. It is a center for Buddhists in Chengdu. Make a visit and when you are done. Step outside to sip some tea in a beautiful garden or fill up your belly in a vegetarian buffet",
          "It is a monastery complex in a park. I took a lot of good photos there. The main monastery felt a little empty, it is more crowded in the outdoor tea shop.",
          "The whole area is great. Including the noodle and sandwich food opposite of the entry and the shops nearby",
          "Spend a great time exploring the temple and surrounding areas. Temple and adjourned park is great as well as the surrounding space with lots of cafes to explore.",
          "Very traditional place within the city. Get a glimpse into a modern run monastery with traditional flair. We saw mostly female monks here. Interesting to see them display loads of fruit as gifts in front of the various shrines. Young and old Chinese were there saying prayers. I",
          "Both were closed when we arrived around 7pm. But it had some great places to take place photos and a cute little garden area.",
          "Sadly most temples in China have been turned into cheap tourist attractions. Chinese love them and come in huge numbers. They buy some souvenirs, make a lot of noise, spit in between and then hope for the best after lighting some incense sticks. This place is no exception",
          "Well worth the stop. The grounds and beauty are a wonderful oasis in a very contemporary city. The monks chanting and its history help weave a spell. Amazing in the fog.",
          "An awful lot of steep steps! Lots of locals offering to carry you to the top for a reward of course. I loved the cable car and walk around the lake. There\u2019s usually a boat but it wasn\u2019t working on our visit. The hike to the top left me gasping with thighs burning!",
          "This is a pretty popular temple with the locals. The grounds are pretty as well. Worth a visit when in Chengdu. Shouldn't take more than 1.5 hrs to visit this place.",
          "We went with friends who grew up near the monastery and its spectacular to walk the grounds. It's rich in history but since we did come in the summer the mosquitoes were in full force.",
          "We did not take a guided tour but I think we would have gained a lot if we had. Some of the signs were in English but not all. The grounds are beautiful and wide spread.",
          "Free to get in and there are a number of shrines. At the back you will hear Buddhist monks chanting grandiosely from the hall amidst nice autumn brown leaves outside. Teahouse is on the right of the temple with bamboo tables but it is too busy with no seats left. Another",
          "Did a last minute visit before my flight out, take the subway cheap, reliable and fast, with a short final walk to location. It\u2019s a weekends but the crowd is still manageable, like the whole environment maybe I walk in from the north side not sure of the other walkway to",
          "We visited on a very busy day when it was crowded with locals but I think that added to the atmosphere. Wandered around and we had a guide so got a lot of background information and history which helped with the appreciation and understanding. Great place to visit for a couple",
          "We visited on a rather gray morning but there was lots of activity inside and outside of the monastery. It's very traditional Chinese in a country that's modernizing so quickly you can forget all its history if you don't make an effort. I'm not sure if we heard services going on",
          "This place goes back to old chinese buddhist roots even the government wants all pp to be atheists nowadays. Its worth visit. You can see buddhist ceremonies taking place, its big and has a nice park area to hang out in the green.",
          "Being a Buddhist this was a must in Chengdu, although I have been before I visited the Monastery twice this time. Also went to the tea rooms next door.",
          "There are no admission fees to pay. You can stroll around to visit the various buildings within the grounds, where there are many trees. There is a vegetarian restaurant in the grounds and just outside the attraction there are small restaurants selling noodles. There were",
          "Go during the lantern festival. It will be crowded but it's really the best time to check out this place. A hundred different activities and performances to see, and huge lantern sculptures like you never imagined possible. Really impressive! Kids will love it, it's like sensory",
          "It\u2019s a nice change to see a functioning temple with a steady stream of worshippers (even if there are also a number of tourists). It\u2019s quite an elaborate place with several buildings separated by courtyards. The buildings look genuinely old, and their ornamentation quite",
          "On the last of my trip in Chengdu, I decided to visit Wenshu Yuan Monastery cuz it is quite close to my hotel. So after the breakfast, I walked to the monastery. The monastery is not far away from the main road but when I walked into the monastery, all the noise from the",
          "I went with a local who could translate for me. I don't think it would be as good of an experience without a translator, but would still be interesting. There were Buddhist prayer services going on, which were cool to see. We were able to organize tea, from Mount Emei, which",
          "if you like the ancient architecture the monastery is a must visit. Otherwise stick to the surrounding markets for all kinds of shopping.",
          "This beautiful monastery with two names is located at n\u00ba 66 Wenshu Yuan street. You need to take the underground line 1 and get off at the station with the same name. Then ask a local if you can't see any signs, take into account that it is also called Manjushri Monastery.You",
          "We enjoyed walking through this monastery with our guide, Jim. It was a lovely day, it was filled with religious folks (monks and nuns) as well as the public. Very pretty grounds and interesting architecture.",
          "We were taken here by our guide Victor from Real China Tours. his commentary made this Monastery visit the best of the many temple visits we made in China. The Monastery is beautiful and it is full of history and stories. It is worth just stopping and watching the locals",
          "Amazing Temple in the North of the historic case, has large rooms and many rooms and beautiful chapel, I would say that part of the nervous system of this vast city of 22 million inhabitants, is a temple with a large extension, has a park fantastic with high trees and small",
          "This is one of the very famous temple in Chengdu. It is a must to visit if you like history and want to understand more about Buddhism. The temple is pretty big and compare with the others, it is not that commercialized. Prepare to spend at least 2 hours if you want to cover",
          "There was only one English signage we saw that explains the monastery so we don't know a lot about it. But while exploring the area ourselves we saw one sign 'vegetarian restaurant'. Turned out to be a nice place to have lunch! We recommend bringing a book like Lonely Planet",
          "The history here was very interesting. We just weren't allowed to take photos. Which from a tourist perspective is not optimum.",
          "Important and attractive, a pleasure and instructive particularly briefly before closure at 5 PM when not crowded.",
          "Jason our guide made this temple very special his knowledge and enthusiasm for this temple made our visit very special Jason explained little details which made everything more interesting",
          "This Monastery is a lovely place to hang out and drink tea and coffee. The vegetarian restaurant offers a great value buffet, the a la carte menu is good but a bit expensive. There's good coffee in the cafe as well. The real winner has to be the steamed mushroom buns in the",
          "Very nice and interesting monastery with a hundred bells pagoda next door. Please respect the premises calm as monks and believers are praying there. Also beware that if you can take pictures of the alleys you can't photograph the several Buddha statues in the temple houses.",
          "It wasn't the easiest place to find as we took the wrong exit from the metro station but eventually stumbled across it. To add to the complexity the street signage referred to an alternative monastery but when we went inside we discovered it was the one we had been looking for.",
          "Not only a beauty, holy site, but a place where you can feel the history and culture. I was lucky enough to be there when the lay Buddhists were paying and chanting. Hauntingly beautiful. As a plus, there is a wonderful vegetarian restaurant on site.",
          "We visited this place for about 2 hours. As soon as you walk in you are taken back in time and really feel like you are living in that era. There were monks walking around and did not seem like a tourist trap. Our guide was able to explain many things to us as everything is in",
          "This was a great 'stop off' as part of a group tour - so glad we did. I loved this place. The history and the architecture was amazing. Great for pictures!",
          "We went to see this place by walk and Stumbled upon an Uygur kebab maker. \u0130t was the highlight of our day. His kebab was very delicious and only for 10 yuan. He opened an Uygur dubbed movie (fast and furious) while we waited for him to cook our meat.",
          "Location is easily accessible as its inside city centre. Place feel serene with many worshippers. We happened to also see some blessing ceremony there. Not smoky unlike other typical temples",
          "Offered complimentary incense and encouraged non Buddhists to burn it and offer a prayer or make a wish. I also enjoyed the premeditated singing by the monks.",
          "So glad I decided to visit. I love these kind of places. A casual, open area to roam and explore. Beautiful buildings, but I just loved the serene, verdant gardens - makes me want to be a Buddhist.",
          "We stayed at the Tibet Hotel within walking distance of here. It is quite a large complex, but you can walk around within 1-2 hours and look at the shops afterwards. It is a very solemn and quiet place with nice gardens, fish pond and temple. There are some little touristy",
          "Many temples. The place is free, very beautiful, there are also gardens but it is unnecessary to enter. Later there are many food stalls. Nice for those who have not yet seen temples in China.",
          "The Wenzhou Monastery is a quiet refuge within the bustling city of Chengdu. The monastery is easy to find, free to enter, and wonderful to visit and look around. The site is a popular place for locals to pray. It's quiet and calm. People talk in hushed voices, if at all.",
          "Beautiful buildings and gardens. A vegetarian restaurant is part of the compound. I have not tried it but the restaurant across the street is very local. The tea house is a good experience. Well worth the visit.",
          "I had just come from Tibet, where the Vajrayana monasteries are very different from the Mahayana monasteries of China. But even without knowing the details, this monastery was exceptionally beautiful. For one thing it is an island of calm and quiet in a huge and bustling city.",
          "A real oasis, away from the cityscape. A good place to stroll and escape any heat. There's a pleasant outdoor tea shop.",
          "It was pretty interesting to have a look in the Buddhist culture. The entrance is free and it's huge. There might not be any descriptions available for foreigners but it's self-explanatory. There were a tea garden and a veg restaurant on the premises. a little pricey but the hot",
          "This Qingyang neighborhood is in fact very nice to visit. Free entrance and quiet atmosphere of this temple make a perfect halt while walking around the area. Easy access via the Wenshu subway station.",
          "This was a beautiful visit in so many ways. The whole place is tranquil with a deep feeling of spirituality. You can wander amongst the water lily ponds and smell the incense. There are amazing carvings, paintings and embroidery in the temples. The wonderful tea house is",
          "Nice quiet place. Beautiful temples. Many praying visitors. I think one eat here with the monks. Top tea house next door.",
          "This is a famous monastery of Chengdu. The garden of the monastery is wonderful. It is very peaceful so I recommend people to go early in the morning.",
          "Wenshu yuan is a very beautiful place and free of charge. It's well worth going, but eating or drinking is not recommended- it's over priced, a very simple lunch for two people cost 150RMB, a pot of tea charge over 50RMB, easy! So just try not to eat there.",
          "As an active monastery this is full of energy and enthusiasm. The architecture is beautiful and in great condition. It's quite big with a few buildings and courtyards plus a garden too. No photos of the Buddha shrines allowed. Well worth checking out. Has its own metro",
          "This temple is crowded with tourists and enthusiastic Buddhists. There're some volunteer guides who can speak English. If you want to know more detail of the temple. You'd better consult with them.",
          "While the other historical sites in Chengdu are converted in shops and restaurants, this monastery is still functional. You can still see the real activities there. Surprisingly wide, quiet, don't forget to go around through the garden. Outside the old houses are reconstructed",
          "Lovely to walk around old architecture, seeing the fine wood craft/details. Remember that when you arrive at the monastery area, the name is not clearly marked out.",
          "Definitely a class C site, not that pretty and not that interesting. This is not the best use of your time in Chengdu, unless you have lots of it.",
          "Highly recommended. We enjoyed our visit very much. It is not well known by the tourists so we could see hiw the local people worship and spend their time at the monastery.",
          "We have visited quite a few temples across China, but this was our first monastery. The difference is notable; the monastery seems a much more lively and interesting experience, leaving you with a sense of wonder. Wear bug spray when walking around the grounds, I got quite a few",
          "I was surprised at how bazaar-like this place was. In all, I found the Monastery a bit confusing, but visually, I found the grounds a trove of Chinese architectural details and delights.",
          "It amaze me how peaceful and beautiful was this place. Truly a unique experience with a cultural perspective.",
          "We went here after seeing many temples already. In that way this one doesn't stand out. But the garden is very nice, the teahouse as well. Also tried some dishes of th vegetarian 'restaurant' which were cheap and fine. Nice place to relax",
          "I had lived in Tibet for six months before I was hit by Hip A from nowhere. My wife and I had to head down from the plateau back to Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province in South-Western China. It was mid of the summer. It was hot and humid during the day but",
          "Take time on your journey to watch locals offer prayers to the many Buddas. You too can offer your own. This was a wonderful way to see the spiritual side of culture on Chengdu.",
          "Wenshu Yuan Monastery, also known as Aidao Nunnery (according to the English signs posted at the entrance and inside the grounds) is absolutely outstanding. It features several exquisite statues of Buddha and related figures, as well as dining rooms and other gathering places",
          "Just walk around and relax. Sit down and contemplate and look at some of the exhibits and statues of monks",
          "Come to relax in the beautiful gardens and see a working Monastery. Vegetarian restaurant next door open for lunch.",
          "We didn't visit the monastery itself but stopped for an iced coffee in the coffee shop/ restaurant, and it was perfect. Very beautiful, nice drink, and cool in the blistering Summer heat. Well worth a visit!",
          "This place as some of the best vegan food. I ate here for lunch many days, while in Chengdu. The people are very friendly. Make sure to eat everything on your plate",
          "This is a fascinating place, both for its architecture and for the life that goes on inside and around it. This is very much an actively used temple, not a museum piece for interested visitors. As such, there is much to catch the eye: people bringing turtles to be released in",
          "When you arrive at the monastery, you can't help feeling in awe of the old architecture. It is quite beautiful and serene. There is a strong aire of respect within the grounds, which is certainly a must. There are certain areas where photography is forbidden, but most areas are",
          "Close to the MRT station and good food stall around the area in the evening. I only stayed for about 30 mins as there is not too much to see",
          "At first as a non Buddhist i felt like a bit of an intruder walking around here as the site is clearly so well valued in the Buddhist community. There was a lot of praying going on and I just generally felt slightly awkward. Once we wandered round a bit and got away from the",
          "There is something special about this place. When I went there was not a tourist to be seen while monks walked around. Beautiful scenery, a good place to relax out of the buzz of the city. Another plus is the entrance is free and there is a wonderful restaurant. If you looking",
          "I was unclear how much this facility was supposed to be a monastery or a place where tourists could eat and spend money. I wasn't overly impressed with it, but if one hasn't seen a monastery then it warrants a visit, particularly since it is essentially in the heart of Chengdu.",
          "Very pretty monastery, lots to see. It as also an active monastery as you can see monks walking around. They were getting ready to eat lunch when we were there. There are also little shops along the outside that were cool to explore",
          "We went several times to the restaurant here, and then meditated in the great hall. This place was a sanctuary; I was so grateful for our 3 hour lunch break so I had time to eat and meditate before going back to class at Chengdu U. of TCM. The lunch buffet was just amazing,",
          "If you have seen one Monastery, you will recognize the format, and this one follow the structural format to the teeth, front entrance gate, three levels, and the library building at the back. The architect and the carving are exquisite. They offer tours of the monastery couple",
          "There aren't many Buddhist temples in Chengdu, so this one was pretty cool to visit. Note that the Chinese name is correct but the English translation of the monastery name is different (Manjushri monastery) which can make it a bit confusing trying to find. Typical Buddhist",
          "Very tranquil atmosphere. Many people worshiping. Very easy to find once leaving the metro. Amazing history on display. Great photographs.",
          "This big monastery is a true pleasure to explore and discover . Amazing atmosphere of peace and quiet. People you meet here are so much different than those I meet on the way . Great occasion to have a look at original monks and there is great vegetarian restaurant there and tee",
          "The temple's architecture was awesome and I enjoyed my quiet time looking at the Buddhist statues, it's history and surroundings. After finishing the temple visit, I walked around and found the famous noodles stall right across. The famous cookie bakery can also be found further",
          "Many beautiful photo opportunities. A lovely place to see history and lovely architecture. A serene environment.",
          "The Wenshu Temple is an impressive building because of its Chinese architecture. It is still in daily use as a temple with a mixture of visitors and those at prayer amid the incense and tranquillity. Well worth a visit.",
          "Very beautiful architecture , and wonderful well maintained gardens make this place an oasis of peacefulness...",
          "As noted, free to enter, pretty gardens and lots to see. Wenshuyuan has one of my favorite Buddha statues I've seen in China (and I've seen a lot). For me, this is one of two temple/monasteries that I revisit because they continue to hold my interest. This is because of the",
          "This Monastery is lovely to visit, lovely gardens where you can watch all the local people enjoying life, meeting, playing games, chatting and drinking tea. It's only about 15 mins in a taxi from city center, there was no fee to get in and you could just stroll around. The",
          "Amaxingly peaceful pla e even when busy. We went on a sunday pm and had lunch which was a vegetarian hot pot. It was ok but not brilliant. The star is the surroundings and the people dotted around the grounds. Magic to zee groups of men playing chinese chess (and not gambling)",
          "Unless you're all templed out, (and there is a big danger of that in China) this is a beautiful example of how the Buddhist religion has been preserved in China, with significant relics by the score. Right next door is a lovely al fresco tea-house, where our guide introduced us",
          "I loved this monastery and went twice while in Chengdu, and would've gone more. Weather in mid-April was amazing so we sat outside for hours drinking tea at the tea house there. The monastery grounds are also beautiful as well if you want to get up and stroll. Tea is only",
          "I loved it here! After a full day of the Panda Base the day before this was a perfect place to spend a few hours. The monastery was in a different style to what I'm used to in Beijing so it is well worth a visit. The gardens are gorgeous. Small but lovely! I recommend bringing a",
          "Visited with our family. A peaceful place. Which day would be destroys the street outside. Idiot taxi drivers. Good restaurant.",
          "This is a beautiful temple with wonderful gardens - and very easy to get to by subway. The gardens were really outstanding - there is a tea room that was recommended to me that I did not visit. It was raining - but that didn't really detract from my visit.",
          "I like the Color of the temple . It's something difference than I expected . It's a nice place to visit . It's full of Culture and history . It's a clean place. Only few tourist here. Recommended",
          "Still a working Buddhist temple. I was surprised at how many people were there worshipping while we visited. Great little tea garden attached to temple",
          "I would not recommend going out of your way to visit but if you are in the area then worth spending an hour or so wondering around the monastery and grounds. The highlight was the tea room adjacent to the monastery, wonderful jasmine tea and a great place to watch the world go",
          "Visited as part of your but nothing of interest if you are not into Chinese history. After seeing Forbidden City etc this was just another similar looking temple with statue figures. Gardens were nice to walk through. Would not have been upset not to visit.",
          "This working monastery has delightful grounds that are open to the public free of charge. The grounds make a beautiful setting for the main buildings. The garden was quiet on the day we visited ,even though many of the other places were crowded. It is very peaceful. Next door",
          "We enjoyed an hour of walking around the various buildings and taking in the beautiful chinese architecture. Its a very serene and peaceful place.",
          "on a chilly Saturday in March I was warmed by the energy and spirit here. many people coming with flowers and participating in the ceremonies. some \"local\" shopping very near by",
          "A very interesting place with multiple tempels. Great stroll with the children though the various sections. Do go to the tea house next door. Very nice and super for a (late) afternoon!",
          "If you want to visit a real monastery, not set of for tourists (only), this is a good pace. Have a vegetarian buffet lunch, and stroll the grounds.",
          "It is a wonderful place to visit very picturesque and full of history. You can visit the numerous temples and purchase candles with incense to light and make wishes in one of the squares. The monastery is reachable by Metro and there is no entry fee.",
          "With a history going back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) Chengdu's Wenshu Yuan Monastery is a a premier attraction within the city - it is free to enter and a place to linger and soak up the tranquility and the gentle feelings of its extensive grounds. Much of what visitors find",
          "This is a lovely monastery in a cute section of town. Best part is they have a gourmet vegetarian Chinese restaurant.",
          "This is \"working/operation\" monastery. A few of the buildings were built in late 1600s with lots of contribution from Qing emperors. The place includes newer buildings and garden. The statues are historical old and are \"Gods\", and therefore, pictures are not permitted of those",
          "I was a bit sceptical about visiting this site and happy that I did in the end. It is well worth the visit for a look into a real and still operational monastery.",
          "This place is situated near the old part of chengdu. .it's a peaceful place to wander, good if you have a guide to give you an explanation of the history",
          "This is a beautiful working monastery surrounded by old buildings. There is no charge to enter. The gardens are beautiful and the statues magnificent. Although photos are prohibited, I think you can get away with a picture or two from your cell phone as long as you are",
          "Quiet place, there is a nice tea house next to the monastery where people drink tea/coffee and eat snacks",
          "A brilliant monastery to visit. Go on a Saturday morning for a ceremony the monks do where they also have a service where they provide food",
          "It was a very enjoyable visit. It is quiet and nice place to visit, you can walk around but like most Monastery's you can not take photos. The gardens were lovely and its a great place to take a day trip.",
          "You can wander in the Monastery but can't take pictures of the Buddhas. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, some people are praying. There is a little garden and the monastery is very colorful and decorated.",
          "A natural garden setting that presents temples Chinese religious or historical figures, and many impressive strucutures",
          "I visited the Monastery yesterday and it was lovely to see the different groups doing Tai Chi in the gardens, the monks strolling around and to see a Buddhist service and hear the monks and others singing their refrains. There were places to sit if you were tired and locals",
          "The architecture and structures make this worth visiting by themselves Throw in the fact that there are some of the cities most delicious small restaurants nearby and it becomes a must visit.",
          "I took a lot of pictures there. Of course the grounds of the Monastery is great but the surrounding area is fabulous as well. the giant bonsai trees lining the street is quite a site. On the way there, we passed by s very small noodle place that was ALWAYS packed with people. We",
          "A really nice monastery. It is a really calming place to visit with traditional architecture. Go see it !",
          "Its a pretty experience & quite Jurassic Park esc outside in the garden thing. Nice little temple-huts and the monetary itself is pretty awesome on the outside. Easy to find- has its own metro station!",
          "This area is pleasant enough but really it seems to cater more for devotees or followers of the faith. Not so much of a tourist attraction for outsiders. Apart from the usual pavilions they cater quite well as a restaurant/cafeteria. A short walk from the subway and no effort",
          "Visited the wenshu yuan monastery while visiting Chengdu on business in January. It was very interesting and a good place to visit. Some people worshipped the Buddha and plenty of orange clad monks walking around. They were also getting ready to celebrate the Chinese New Year",
          "It's beautiful and it could be really peaceful if everyone read the signs (and if this was enforced )- do not take photos ,do not shout , do not have a family argument etc. The monastery is beautiful once you get passed all the chaos that surrounds the perimeter. The garden",
          "This is actually where my Gran's house is so very convenient. It's a gorgeous traditional area full of tea houses and other very Chinese style buildings. The main attraction is the monastery, but the whole area is beautiful. My favourite restaurant is here- it's a famous noodle",
          "Very interesting monastery with some beautiful buildings,but beware of taking photos-the attendants don't like it !",
          "My favourite place in all Chengdu. Amazing environment, buildings fabulous to look at, nice surroundings with shop and cafe areas. Great place to stop and think deeply.",
          "One of the main temples in the city. Atmosphere there is relaxing. You can spend there couple of hours, visiting several temples, walking in the nice park and drinking tea in a tea shop. You have to buy tea near the entrance, keep the pink slip, you have to give it to the",
          "This is a surprise to be found in an urban area. We got lucky and we observed a ceremony during our visit. Being a monastery, it is a very solemn place. It takes about an hour to visit the area.",
          "Very easy to get there. There is a subway station with the name of this monastery. Inside is beautiful, It is definitely worth it! Free entrance.",
          "We almost skipped this gem of a temple. Glad we didnt. Impressive architecture. Linger in relaxing, quiet, peaceful realms once u enter the doorway.",
          "Had a quick drop by this area, its a garden with a few building and there's a vegetarian restaurant which we are suppose to try but didnt get the chance to. I expected the area to be packed with people but maybe the timing we went there was not so many people. The \u201c\u9f99\u6284\u624b\u201d the",
          "For you who is doing downtown tourism in Chengdu, this is worth to visit. You can take metro to this monastery. Good building architecture. You can buy some handycraft inside the location, there is also a nice garden tea house where you can sit and relax (but not in high season,",
          "I wasn't expecting to enjoy Wenshu Monastery as much as I did. I was surprised by the tranquility and even though there were a lot of people around, it still felt very peaceful. The temple itself is gorgeous. Entry is free so it's definitely worth checking out. The surrounding",
          "This was a lovely place to visit full of locals praying. It wasn't part of our tour so it was lovely to get away from the regular tourist areas. We also had tea with the locals in the tea garden",
          "A pretty big temple with multiple pavilions dedicated to different Buddhas. The stroll in the temple grounds are very relaxing and there is a big area next to it that serves vegetarian food and beverages. There are some restaurants opposite the temples that serves pretty good",
          "Unknowingly, we visited on the 15th of Lunar Calendar. The place was crowded with worshippers and volunteers. We walked around the many halls and was rather in awe. The temple was giving out free vegetarian food in adisposal bowl. The volunteers worked hard and the people",
          "Beautiful buildings, architecture. Be prepared for indigents soliciting donations, but all in all a wonderful experience and beautiful place to visit. Especially loved the tea service that we had!",
          "We were staying at the Sofis Jinyuan Hotel about 200m away. I walked here after breakfast and spent an hour enjoying the Monastery and Park. It has a series of temples interconnected by courtyard gardens. Early in the day there were groups of older people reading out loud in",
          "It was quite nice, but not much to do or see. If you're nearby take a look - but don't go out of your way. The vegetarian restaurant was great though !",
          "This monastery is still functioning and I spotted many locals going there to pray. As a tourist, I have rated this visit poor because there is no English language signs on what were on display and it's history. My family ended having a serene walk at the compound garden.",
          "Lots to see, walk slowly & soak it up. A place to relax & contemplate, especially in the Bonsai gardens.",
          "We loved this temple and the surrounding area. Not to be confused with the Wuhou Temple which is much more touristy. This temple is free to get in, and is full of activity. They feed local people, lots of people go to pray, school kids go to paint pictures, and everyone is",
          "Plenty things to see at this monastery in the heart Chengdu city. Easy access by public transportation and taxi but difficult finding car parking if you drive. No entrance fee needed and they even provide incense to burn for praying. Plenty beautiful photo spots all over this",
          "It was very nice to be able to visit the temple for free. It was a sunny day and not very busy so it was a very serene experience. We had food in the vegetarian restaurant which was perfect. Because of the good weather many locals were having tea in the garden which added to the",
          "If you visit here do try to look around the temple and enjoy the vegetarian food at the restaurant. Also a good market locally with lots of local produce on sale as well as some good arts and crafts shops. A nice place to spend a couple of hours when in Chengdu",
          "Since it is part of the tour, so we went there. It is OK, nothing exciting, since we have been to so many monasteries and temples and pagodas, we have seen it all.",
          "This offers a great Chinese experience, with an excellent guide who explained the history and heritage of the monastery. You should add this to your agenda in Chengdu ... plus try the street snacks right opposite the entrance, the spicy noodles were fabulous.",
          "We visited the vegetarian restaurant based upon previous TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. I can not eat gluten food and this was the best meal I've eaten during my current holiday in China. We arrived too late for the morning buffet so had the hotpot. A lovely",
          "In comparison to the madness of the rest of China this is very child and relaxed. Not packed with people and great to people watch",
          "The monastery feels like a living place where people want to go for the temple, ceremonies and gardens it seemed to us; it does not exist just as a show case for tourists. Many of the visitors prayed at the shrines and make offerings or lit incense. It felt very inclusive and",
          "Very peaceful, simple monastery, with nice gardens to walk around. There is a tea house beside the monastery where u can have tea and rest your legs",
          "Was nice to stroll and relax. Nice gardens, well kept. Do not go expecting too much as you may be disappointed. Worth the visit, entrance 60RMB",
          "I thought the monastery was great. It was immaculately looked after - no rubbish, very clean, neat and pristine. We strolled through the grounds and admired the old buildings. There were lots of monks in there going about their business. For me, a highlight was drinking tea in a",
          "This is a lovely monastery and gardens in the middle of Chengdu. Access is easy as it is 5 minutes walk from the Metro. You can stroll gently through the labyrinth of courtyards, decorated with works of art and calligraphy. On one side is a lovely garden, on the other is a",
          "You probably do not need to spend more than 30 mins here. Gardens well maintained. Locals praying to painted statues. Elders praying inside temple chanting.",
          "I can't rate this high enough the food here is by far the best buffet I've ever had!! For 35 RMB, there's an assortment of delectable vegetarian food at the buffet, or for 50 RMB there's the Hotpot (also vegetarian). Each dish is packed full of flavour, there's a huge variety,",
          "Such a tranquil place in such a busy city! I would highly recommend a visit and just walk around the grounds. Then please do stop at the vegetarian restaurant and teahouse! The restaurant offers buffet (35yuan) til 2pm then hotpot (50yuan) til 9pm - the food is amazing! We tried",
          "Beautiful temple, not too many tourists, the place is big and really has a nice atmosphere We arrived during the monk's lunch and got a chance to hear their beautiful chants If you go a bit further nice tibetan market again in great temple setting with food carts, stalls ...",
          "Probably a really nice place in its own right to be fair, but compared to other temples we visited this didn't really wow us.",
          "nice temple. not too much people, so you can relax in the park and absorb some energy for further sightseeing.",
          "Ancient monastery teaming with history and beautiful architecture Go with a guide and get the full experience a very relaxed place",
          "This is on the list of must dos in Chengdu - well laid out but suggest you take guide to explain everything - nearby shopping and good street with typical souvenirs, coffee and tea shops and some touristy restaurants",
          "Beautiful temple, and also grounds around to walk and reflect peacefully. Can not miss! It's also free, which is great as well, but we were sure to check out the vegetarian buffet that is attached to the monastery. Would definitely do them together :)",
          "The street outside is very manic but it's a real Chinese cultural experience. The monastery is worth seeing, it's free to get in and gives you an insight into the Buddhist religion here in China.",
          "I think it was great to walk around and take a few pictures however it was very busy when I went and I could not actually take in any of the peaceful atmosphere you would expect from a Buddhist temple.",
          "Great place to wander about after coming off the busy street. While inside the temple can be busy it is free. Trend left upon entering for a garden stroll and right for the tea house and vegetarian restaurant (2nd floor). Beautiful space and wonderful respite for an hour or two.",
          "Wenshu Yuan hasn't changed much since last time I visit (more than 15 years ago). Glad to see everything is preserved as it should be. If you fancy a cup of tea, there is a tea house next to the monastery (previously also part of monastery building). There, you will feel all the",
          "Having been to Tibet, I would say this is one of those places that genuinely is peaceful and feels like you're in a different part of Chengdu. Definitely not a tourist catchtrap, there is a tea house in the complex that is a little pricey but very quaint. Visited this place",
          "This is the kind of place I may not have paid attention to previously having seen numerous temples, monasteries and such in Asia. It's a functioning site, with barely any tourists and some hidden lanes to walk down. Not far from very many excellent eateries.",
          "We crossed this Monastery by excident. What a Nice place to visit. Really a must see when you are in Chendu",
          "There is no admission fee. A place where folks come for prayers and quietness. Some halls have aged fresco and paintings where phototakings are not allowed, flash or no flash. There is a large dining hall where folks can rest but we realised that was not the vegetarian",
          "We spent about an hour in the temple with our guide explaining the history and all the figures displayed. It was a lot of history, maybe too much to retain. Good to see so many Chinese tourists there.",
          "Went here twice on my recent visit to Chengdu! Once on my own and another time with a friend. This is a beautiful little town that you can easily spend a whole day in. Cheap trinkets and Souvenirs can be bought everywhere along the streets and you can still appreciate the",
          "Wenshu Monastry is a really nice oasis of calm in bustling downtown Chengdu. It's in a restored \"old\" neighborhood. There is a lovely vegetarian buffet available at lunchtime, plus a teahouse. It's definitely one of my favorite places to chill out on a day off work here.",
          "It's a little odd to have this right in the middle of the city but you so quickly absorb the peace and quiet. The site has lots of temples and you could wander for ages. Don't miss the gardens - there are areas to release animals including a large turtle pool. When we were there",
          "A nice, fairly quiet place. Not sterile like so many temple museums in the Far East, its still in use. The surrounding streets are great to sit out and chill with any number of exotic teas, ideal if you have a smog free day!",
          "Beautiful place, a must see when in Chengdu. Easy to reach on metro line 1. Do : see the shrines and walk around the park! Don't: Take photos of the statues or monks - it is disrespectful!",
          "Glad we came out guide had never been and didn't know where it was which was odd... As there was no entrance fee I can see how he didn't know about it. But it was worth a 45 pit stop after the day with panda s",
          "In the heart of the city so no excuse to miss it really. An oasis of calm. Its a great place to walk around, enjoy the incense and people going about their business. Great photo opportunity.",

          "Beautiful Buddhist monastery in Chengdu. We visited late August, unlike most places we visited, this wasn't so crowded. The atmosphere is very calming, we lit some incense and greeted the Buddha statue with a bow. The buildings are very traditional and colourful, a nice place to",
          "We have seen our fair share of monasteries, temples and palaces in China, this one was one of the nicer ones, especially because it was so nicely embedded in the middle of skyscrapers. It is like a small oasis of tranquility; relaxing and nice, also, we were almost alone when we",
          "Forget about the over rated pandas, this is the place to see if you're visiting Chengdu. It's right in the heart of the city, yet it's tranquil and peaceful and best of all, completely free! Inside the walls of the monastery are some of the most beautiful shrines I've ever seen.",
          "Free to walk around and be peaceful and calm. A pleasant hour in very busy China and as we were staying at Buddhazen hotel it would have been daft not to go!",
          "It's a nice temple, one of largest Buddhist Wen Shu Monastery in town. In the middle of a crowded city it's nice to find a quite place.... Not a \"must go\" place for me. The entry fee to Wenshu Temple is exceptionally cheap at just 5 yuan. A vegetarian restaurant inside Wenshu",
          "I was by myself when I visited the monastery. The monastery was a nice surprise when I was exploring Chengdu. I had a stopover in Chengdu on my way to Tibet. I didn't really do much research on the city, so I was pleasantly surprised by this big and beautiful monastery. It also",
          "If you like temple you will enjoy wenshu temple. Is big and calm, actually you can find peace. Usually Chine is crowded everywhere, but this temple is not that bad.",
          "This monastery is really nothing special for a tourist. It could be probably more interesting for a Buddhist.",
          "This is a nice place to visit. Its in a nice calm and quiet surrounding. I wish it had more monks chanting. Looks like this monastery didn't have any ceremony/events when I visited in the afternoon.",
          "Very beautiful and interesting, tranquil gardens, ewll-kept. Nice street outside, walk around the shops - people getting their ears cleaned !",
          "Wenshu Monastery is a nice little place to re-set and re-charge from the craziness of the city. The gardens are lush and green and given it is a place of worship with locals attending for prayer it is a quiet space. It is important to respect that. There are lots of gift shops",
          "Chengdu is very accessible and all the town attractions are so well reached by metro or cab. If near go in and walk through the nice graden and see the several (active!) chapels. We went at the end of opening time, it was quiet peacefull and prayers started for the monks (not",
          "A nice break from the traffic and noise of urban life. The grounds are manicured - offering a variety of natural settings for selfie-stick addicts;) It is a very popular site for locals and tourists, so early mornings provide a more tranquil experience. Check out the tea",

          "Go early, about 8:30 to see the prayer It needs only about about an hour an half to investigate the whole place The garden there are awesome People there are very nice, they welcomed me despite my veil.",
          "we spent ages walking round the grounds, the gardens are beautiful and well maintained, just loads of turtles and fish, pond with some huge toads different colours, this is a working monastery so you see lots of monks working, you have to visit",
          "I went on a day that was mercifully short on tourists so was spared the constant yammering and pushing and shoving that is so common throughout China. I was surprised to see that the grounds were not kept as well as one might expect for an attraction of this magnitude but",
          "this is a good place to visit in Chengdu, very chinese style. we love there very much. we recommended to all travellers in Chengdu.",
          "This is a surprisingly huge monastery complex, tranquility in an otherwise bustling in an urban setting, Being accompanied by someone who can read/translate the Chinese texts is a must for understanding the exhibits in the numerous pagodas",
          "There are two outstanding architectural features..the first is the elegant pagoda and the entrance and the second in the magnificently decorated library building. The rest are prayer buildings and monk accommodation (and the couple I saw were pretty devastating table-tennis",
          "Very nicely maintained monastery. Not too crowded. Quiet. It still gives one the zen feeling. Again, once is enough if you are not a believer.",
          "Spent the last day's morning in this big monastery. A nice walk around a serene place. Do walk to the inner part of the monastery where you will find a a little garden and pond. Your child will see many frogs and turtles. Do make some offering of money /donation to help maintain",
          "This monastery is a very cool place to visit. Even if you have seen a lot of temples, it's still enjoyable to sit and have a pot of tea in the gardens, walk around the turtle pond, spot the monastery cats, and explore the grounds. We got here late in the afternoon and although",
          "Perhaps we've seen too many temples in Mt. Emei before coming to Wenshu Monastery, so we weren't too impressed. It's a beautiful monastery to see if it's the first one you see in the country - and they have a lovely park and a turtle pond full of hundreds of small turtles just",
          "Had a great time exploring the monastery. There are tons of great street food right outside and if you want there are some food places on the inside. Def worth a visit while in Chengdu.",
          "It was further back than 2015, but what the heck. Seeing is believing. #Chengdu and you will not be dissatisfied, everyone goes to HK Or Shanghai etc, do yourselves a favor and Visit Chengdu",
          "Great way to spend a leisurely afternoon! The grounds are beautiful and it's enjoyable strolling through.",
          "I walked around this zen Buddhist temple for an hour and found it very peaceful. So many toads, turtles, and fish in the ponds! Not too many people around, even in the afternoon. Entrance is free so can't complain about anything. I had a vegetarian lunch buffet at the attached",
          "I wandered around the temple for a couple of hours. The buildings are beautiful. It was a very peaceful afternoon.",
          "The monastery needs to be looked at as two separate sections. The gardens were superb in the Chinese style of rocks, bamboos and pools. Some of the pools full of turtles and frogs. Very calming as you stroll around. A number of mall pavilions, all elegant architecture. Found one",
          "An 1500 years old historical spot. Current buildings were constructed in 1697 (Kangxi emperor, Qing dynasty). In addition to the beautiful architectures, cultural relics, there is a large exquisite garden. Some websites report that the Monastery opens at 9AM. But when I",
          "This was a nice quiet place to visit. The monastery itself takes under 1 hour to see but it is worth seeing. There were not too many people, even on a Saturday. There are lanes selling food and souvenirs close by. I think it is best combined with other sites rather than taking",
          "Not that interesting to me.. maybe because there is no english explanation on site. The traditional architecture interesting though. The surrounding streets give a local experience which is really interesting for a walk.",
          "Summary: recommend as a nice spot to walk through for families with young kids, and it is okay for strollers. Wenshu Yuan is a really lovely spot to wander through. Our kids most enjoyed the little pond in the back. Look closely and you'll see that whomever designed the area",
          "It was nice to see the traditional Chinese-style architecture in the midst of a busy city. We walked around the quiet park outside the monastery and took a little peek inside the monastery prayer building as the monks chanted prayers. All in all, a nice place but not many things",
          "Temple buildings set within a large wooded garden, criss-crossed with paths. The 'main' entrance is often shut - continue along the road for another 30 metres to a smaller entrance, which should be open. Excellent tea house and vegetarian restaurant in the corner of the site.",
          "The Wenshu Yuan Monastery is a nice visit to spend part of a day. While not very large there is still a lot of beautiful buildings and scenery to take in. Overall it is a nice visit and admission is free.",
          "Convenient to Metro. This is a nunnery. You can see it all in an hour. Area with stalls nearby selling tourist type stuff and some food. I thought there was going to be more to the monastery, so I was a bit disappointed.",
          "Lots of beautiful sculptures. The crystal laughing Buddha statue is particularly remarkable. On the sides are meeting and learning rooms. It is a working temple with lots of worshippers.",
          "We had a tour guide show us the history behind wen Shu monastery which really made a difference. We were able to really understand the history behind the monastery and understand more about the layout and the statues of Buddhism. Fantastic",
          "Really easy to get to and has a bunch of cool stuff to see in the area. Lots of cool shops and stores around, I loved sampling the various street foods that people had cooking.",
          "Green, luscious garden with old men and their pet birds, incense burning in courtyards of monastery and shops/food aplenty, this was a good place to wander around for a few hours.",
          "Unlike a lot of \"museum\" temples this monastery is very alive and in use, great sculptures. We were there during a funeral also of an elderly nun from the community - so it was fascinating to see the cultural aspects of Buddhism beyond the art and arhcitecture.",
          "There's no English spoken here, but fortunately I went with a group of Chinese friends who knew both the restaurant and the food. Being at a Buddhist Monastery it's naturally all vegetarian, but the varieties and flavors were both extensive and unique. I would go again - with",
          "Wonderful Park to walk through, in addition to experience the monastery inside and see the life of the monks. In the main building there are traditional praying dances you can also join. A must visit while in Chengdu",
          "This attraction/ monastery was good to see but not a must in my opinion. The temples were lovely to see but lacks authentic monks and has lots of souvenirs. This took away the authentic vibe of the monastery. The shrines are lovely to see and people still come to worship",
          "This monastery has a peaceful atmosphere, real monks, gorgeous statues and a pagoda. When we were there there had been a funeral for a respected Buddhist, and I have never seen so many floral tributes.",
          "We visited at dusk, the peace and tranquility were palpable, we turned a corner on a courtyard to see a cat on one side, a dove on the other, they sat and slept, a very special place",
          "The aura about this place was so peaceful. I arrived there following the deathof a supreme monk and the entire monastery and its grounds were decorated for his burial. The place was full of monks from all over the world who came to pay their respects. The gardens were beautiful,",
          "This monastery is located in the heart of the city is very peaceful and divine. Gautam Buddha is worshiped in different avatars here as per Chinese/Tau mythology. The place is very beautiful provides an environment as if you're out of all city zigzags. The monastery is quite big",
          "Free entry, interesting history, lovely grounds. We spent way longer wandering around here than planned. Lots of culture to observe, loads of nature too - including the biggest toads in the ponds I have ever seen in my life. Would highly recommend - just come, take a seat,",
          "A very nice temple and park to stroll through. The fact that is still an important Buddhist temple makes it even more impressive. In an hour or two, you can see the complex. But ofcourse, if you are into the Buddhist religion, you can spend all day. There is a tea house and",
          "This monastery is not really anything special. The main halls date from the 19th century and the wooden enchaste windows and carved beams are nice, but not really anything that you haven't seen in China before. However, the on-site vegetarian buffet is great value at 30rmb: the",
          "I really enjoyed Wenshu. Although it was fairly busy it was a rara calm place in this hectic city. The gardens are beautiful as the temples. There is little by way of guidance in English but that's OK. Get a QR scanner for you smartphone as there is help around the Gardens if",
          "This is the place to visit if you want some respite from the hustle and bustle of Chengdu. The grounds are extensive and you must not confuse the monastery with the other buildings next to it; the monastery is the one that has the interesting pagoda in front of it. You should",
          "The Buddhist temple is well worth a visit, and the little streets to the South are pedestrianised with antique and craft shops. There\u2019s also a collectors\u2019 market at the Western end of the pedestrianised area which is particularly lively at weekends. The tea garden next to the",
          "This was just near our hotel and we stumbled across it and were delighted to find this lovely peaceful enclave in the middle of Chengdu. Couldn't find anything in English about going inside so we contented ourselves with enjoying the grounds.",
          "This made for an interesting morning, we enjoyed seeing the carved replica of the city and the many little shops and stalls in the surrounding area.",
          "Not too much to do but stroll at your leisure around this monastery. There is a small pond and you will see quite a few monks.",
          "Enjoy a nice cup of tea in the teagarden, and admire the pretty temples. There is also a beautifull garden. Nice for a walk or a picknick!",
          "A good insight of the Chinese Culture. In Chengdu we were missing the traditional chinese buildings that we found here. I recommend 100% to walk around and get into the small streets were you will find many shops with local souvenirs.",
          "Chengdu is massive, with very high buildings and I was feeling like in an American city with Chinese people, until I found this place. Lovely Chinese architecture. Don't miss it!",
          "We had just arrived in Chengdu and had an afternoon at leisure before spending a full day with pandas the following day. This monastery was situated a good stroll from the hotel, down a busy Main Street and was suggested by the local guide. As two females travelling together we",
          "This place is well worth a visit. Excellant temple with so much history. Wonder through all the building's wonder at their beauty",
          "Wenshu is a lovely place. Numerous temples throughout the gardens to enjoy and watch the locals pray and give thanks. Some of the buildings are hundreds of years old and well conserved and look fantastic. Once you have finished with the monastery walk through the local shopping",
          "We enjoyed beautiful ancient architecture, amidst the present day backdrop. Nearby fun little shops and wonderful little restaurants. We enjoyed a sugar cane drink and some delicious dumplings during our visit.",
          "No entrance fee. Covered-bowl tea and Buddhist cuisine are recommended. you can find traditional food, crafts, calligraphy and painting nearby.",
          "Very beautiful, calm, and large place. Entry is free and it remains open until 5pm only. You can get here by the subway and the nearest station shares the same name as the place - Wenshu Monastery. Then it's just 2 min walk from the station. You see many locals praying, and",
          "While it its truly a very beautiful and spiritual place, if you've been to one monastary/temple/building of this style then there's often not a lot to indentify this as unique.",
          "I visited the monastery for free, not sure if was due to ongoing Chinese new year celebrations or if they made it free. It's a beautiful and photogenic place. I personally particularly enjoyed watching Chinese people holding their traditions, worshiping and praying.",
          "It's big and just like most Buddhism temples all over China. Quiet. It's free and you can find many local snacks around the area.",
          "At First, we thought perhaps the monastery was closed, because there seemed to be a huge f\u00eate happening. It turned out that all the stalls that appear around the temple buildings are actually not a part of the monastery itself, so if you are confused, just let someone point you",
          "This temple is very beautiful, I took many great photos here. I also enjoy the experience since this place is very calm and natural",
          "Free to enter. A well-loved well-cared for space, with plenty of old ladies pottering about their daily lives -- something very different to the 'monasteries' we have in Shanghai which are mere tourist sites. We had a great lunch at the vegetarian restaurant afterwards",
          "We spend most of a morning there and loved wandering about, viewing the art and the court yards. There is a vegetarian restaurant there we would have loved to try but did not have time. A very kind volunteer guide gave us some background about the place.",
          "great to see the culture and this is definately worth adding to an itinerary - some great place to eat as well just outside the gates, so come around lunchtime",
          "I mean, it's an ordinary temple that's a must see in Chengdu. I believe it follows a Taoist tradition. It's great to see locals offer prayers and burn incense. Great chance to see what spirituality looks like in China",
          "If you are a buddhist, this is a place that you can burn an incense stick and make a wish. If you are not a buddhist, this is a place that you can taste the spirit of the buddhists. Around the Monastey, it's also a shopping place with traditional Chinese architecture style.",
          "It's nice, but once you've seen one Buddhist temple, you've seen them all, and if you are going to more cities in China, there are a lot of more interesting ones.",
          "Nice place lots of gold which you can't take photos off. We had a scary lady following us around here though chanting at us saying American British technology bad was really creepy and scary she looked like the thing in the ring film.",
          "We are in Wenshuyuan next to Renmin Park. It is a famous buddhist temple in downtown Chengdu , built during the Tang dynasty .The temple is dedicated to buddhist monastery teachings .It houses over 450 buddha statues and artifacts inside. Besides the halls and gardens, the",
          "Beautiful temple complex, very peaceful and you can spent quite a long time walking around the complex. Though the temple itself can be busy, it isn't as bad as other temples. I enjoyed the quiet walks under dense trees and hear or watch the senior citizens gossip (or argue)",
          "We went as the sun was setting during dusk and it was a very peaceful visit. A really nice contrast from some of the massive hyper kinetic temples - this felt very much like the active monastery it was.",
          "Unlike so many temples that we visited this was a working temple and there was a feeling of peace and solace about it. I really enjoyed the visit.",
          "This area is absolutely my favorite thing I have done in Chengdu. Just when I think I have seen everything, there is another area to discover. There are some spots that are so quiet, I thought I was far out of the city. Probably 5 minutes went by looking at beautiful plants",
          "It's a relatively quiet area when I went in the morning. Nice tea house next to the monastery. Local shopping stalls for souvenirs with some Tibetan shops.",
          "One of Chengdu's finest temples, an extensive complex of Halls and courtyards and gardens. Uncrowded when we visited, it is easy to find (a five minute walk from a subway stop). The surrounding streets are also worth exploring, filled with shops, restaurants and street food. The",
          "A very peaceful place with beautiful architecture of their buildings and well groomed gardens.The area is quite large and we almost missed half of it. It was only that I needed to go to the ladies that I found out the area extended around the back. It was in the back building",
          "Temples, monasteries and Buddhist libraries and more. Many push carts and shops selling local noodles and snacks. Traditional and a place full of history.",
          "Hard to find a quiet place in Chengdu. We strolled the grounds, watched monks play badminton and pingpong then lazed in the adjacent tea house for hours. A very pleasant afternoon.",
          "Interesting part of town and well worth the visit. As others have said it is not unbelievably spectacular but it is a very peaceful place to visit. Firstly, we had lunch there. It was very basic fare, I guess from what they farm locally. Then we partook of tea outside at the tea",
          "This active monastery is beautifully maintained and supported by donations alone. No admission fees, unlike other monasteries in China. Learn about Buddhist traditions of the monastery. Lots of plaques printed in multiple languages explain the significance of the many statues,",
          "Wonderful place to visit, fabulous buildings, real cultural experience. Well worth a visit for anyone visiting Chengdu. A whole little community gone back in time. Really worthwhile visit.",
          "For me this monastery is not a must see. It is nice, though. Usually it's quiet, with just a few chinese buddhists. I find other monasteries more compelling.",
          "What made this place special was that it is still an actual functioning monastery, offering accommodations to pilgrims. In the central courtyard, you are also likely to see saffron-robed monks mingling with the visitors, prostrate worshippers, and you can light your own joss",
          "Very nice. Quiet atmosphere. Don't expect to something incredible or mind blowing. If you like to explore the culture and if you around 4 days in Chengdu - go ahead. Otherwise, skip this place and get out from the city for a nice day trip",
          "This is place is typical of famous tourist destinations in China: commercialized and full of people. There is some lovely original architecture, as well as some newly built or reconstructed areas. It can be exotic to one who has never been to China and also offers an opportunity",
          "There are so many place and temples to visit if you are ever in China but each one of them has its charm and magic. For someone who is from South America, Studies in Europe and had been working between the Middle East and Africa for past 15 years I could not be more happy and",
          "The atmosphere is of a \"suspended time\" and serenity in this monastery. You can see the monks in the garden or in the back courtyard , the young ones also playing ping pong. No noise, just calm. A curiosity are huge wooden fishes that were used to notify if there was place in",
          "We stayed at the hotel Buddha Zen and this is just around the corner. We probably wouldn't have come here otherwise but what a treat. Nice, unspoilt and a really cool pagoda! Being right next door to another really cool, authentic Chinese part of the old town is just double",
          "Nothing spectacular, but a nice monastery with a lovely architecture, placed in the middle of the town. Locals come to pray, light their incents and then get back to the chores of the everyday life... Special mention for the tea house nearby: it has a courtyard full of tables,",
          "The monastery is a haven in the middle of a fairly busy area of Chengdu and it is 2 mins walk from the nearest metro station. The architecture is beautiful and well worth a visit.",
          "An enjoyable working monastery; we particularly enjoyed the walking/chanting meditation. The surprising thing was just how busy and noisy it was with visitors. It felt pretty jam packed with tourists and locals taking photos.",

          "Formidable architecture and definitely a most Zen experience very calming and reflective experience of this monastery. This monastery is in the centre of Chengdu and the architecture and surroundings of the old monastery are classical Chinese architecture in the present very",
          "A large & beautiful old monastery in Chengdu. Tends to get a little crowded. Beautiful garden as well & as an old city gate next door. people come to release animals to enhance karma. Across the street is a wonderful vegetarian restaurant. The whole block is worth a stroll.",
          "A small and not terribly spectacular monastery within easy reach of the metro station. There's some interesting old architectural features, but this one is far from the best of its type. Interesting nonetheless.",
          "We enjoyed a lot our visit. It is located near the metro station. It was free and there were many things to see. After that we went to a tea house. .. what a great experience it was. The tea was tasty only for 10 rmb you getting endless refills :) The people were nice several",
          "Gorgeous monastery, lovely buildings, obviously in active use. Easy to access from the subway & lots of fun little shops & tea houses to browse through afterwards.",
          "We were fortunate to visit on a special day of festival. There were many people and many activities. The architecture was beautiful and witnessing the spiritual devotion to religion was priceless. Authentic, historic and worth a visit.",
          "We can only find the \"old Chengdu living style\" in this place, quiet and relax. U can see old people playing chess, walking along the path slowly, people visiting the temples. There are many words of wisdom in the monastery. It makes a special comparison with the busy",
          "Wenshu monastery is one of the buddists monasteries in Chengdu. It is situated approximately in the city center, and it is really connvenient concerning the public transport (metro, buses). So, you can easily get there and spend wonderful time. This monastery is very quite, the",

          "I've seen many monasteries throughout Asia and found it interesting to see the Chinese Buddhists build one. The architecture is beautiful and unique. People still go to say their prayers and there were a couple of monks wandering around. The garden is also lovely. Well worth",
          "Great Temple, plenty to see, but the real attraction is the surrounding shops, restaurants and markets. Browse the markets before grabbing a bite to eat.",
          "Worth a stop by if in Chengdu. We stopped by on our way back from the panda sanctuary. A typical Chinese monastery with the architecture, incense and statues. There are a number of shops ran by the monastery inside the grounds as well as across the street just outside of the",
          "Take the metro to the station with the same name and walk for maybe 5-10 minutes and you'll enter an oasis of peace in the middle of Chengdu. We had the fortune to witness a buddhist ceremony and the atmosphere was magical with all the incense and chanting. After a peaceful",

          "Very interesting to wander around here, great peaceful respite from the city. With garden paths and trees it is good to get out of the intense heat on a hot day. The small alleys leading to the Monastery were amazing, a big Tibetan influence. Get here via Metro: Wenshu Monastery",
          "There's a badly restored tourist trap of an area outside, which is a complete waste of time, but once you get inside the actual monastery you are transported. Some very beautiful buildings and gardens.",
          "Take the subway line 1 to go there. It's only 2 stations from Tianfu square. When you get out of the station, walk straight ahead about 50 meters. It's a big complex of small and big monastery buildings. Not too crowdy here.",
          "They say if you have seen one Buddhist Temple in China \u2013 you\u2019ve seen them all. Not the case! It\u2019s a really wonderful Temple,not that crowded, with gardens on each side. Very peaceful and puts you in a right mood, I would definitely recommend anyone which has an hour or two in",
          "so here is my thing, it was a perfectly nice temple but other than walking around staring at the architecture etc. I didn't get a whole lot out of it. There were no plaques to put things in perspective or tour guides. It was beautiful but in the same way all the other temples",

          "Really peaceful yet enormous! Much bigger than expected. Lovely tea area where they refill your tea cup from a teapot with an exceptionally long spout. The vegetarian buffet is also great but we got there just as they were packing up at 2pm!",
          "A lot larger than I expected. We strolled through the garden and observed a flock of devoted followers to pray. The place houses a series of ancient relics, painting, calligraphy and saint scriptures. I only felt slightly bothered by its new modern concrete construction\u2026 this",

          "I honestly wasn't expecting a lot, but it was pretty exciting when we went! The surrounding street was filled with hawkers...hawking their wares and food. The temple itself was pretty crowded on the day, and there was a procession of monks and nuns (wearing brown/red robes)",

It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century.

          "The museum is about a 15 minute walk from Dufu\u2019s thatched cottage so you can combine the two easily enough. I spent a bit over an hour at the museum and was very pleased. Actually you could spend longer but I got a late start that day. The museum has a variety of porcelain,",
          "This is a great place for a visit for people of any age. There are interesting exhibits on the history and culture of Sichuan and its people. The exhibits on the minority peoples of Sichuan are really cool and have colourful clothes, traditional tools and weapons and displays",
          "We focused on the bronze and porcelain areas in the museum, but that was a small portion with a lot more to offer at another visit.",
          "This was an interesting place, it is about a culture of people no one knows where they came from and that they were not even Chinese. It is a great mystery for them. If you love history and culture of people, this is a great place for you to go.",

          "Very near to DuFuCaoTang, took a 10 minutes walk on a Saturday afternoon and luckily tickets were still available. Entry to the museum was free. Perhaps it was a weekend so there were volunters around offering explanations on the exhibits being displayed. Perhaps the hall needs",
          "This museum is shockingly small despite its size. The place has a number of areas that are reserved for temporary exhibits but at the time there were none so around 4 or 5 halls were completely empty. Despite this what is there is a good collection.",

          "Had an opportunity to visit and wasn't disappointed. Free to get in with ID or passport and the museum covers the diverse background and history of the Chengdu area as a melting pot for many different peoples in the area. Artifacts, clothing, tools, art, music, and more are on",

          "Sichuan Museum is free. When I went there On a week day, there are not much visitors. They had excellent collection of Daqian Zhang's paintings. I also like their China collection and Tibet Art exhibition. The building itself is beautiful. I cannot not believe this beautiful",

          "Neat collections of ceramic pottery, bronze, silk garments, etc. All the pieces were lumped together as like objects, which we personally didn't like. We were looking for more of a history lesson as opposed to an object display. Very large building with nice facilities. Great",
          "You need about two hours to see everything in this museum (more if you want to read into anything in depth). It is free with a Passport, which is a nice perk.",
          "Quite a lot of historical things to see & appreciate on China' past civilizations such as Jade, Paintings, Porcelains & Costumes. It's free entry to the museum to spend just a few hours there for relaxation.",

          "The artefacts found here are fairly recent, 1986 I think. There are some phenomally beautiful and delicate bronzes, in the form of trees, but rather a lot of them. Another building has been devoted to early agriculture. However, there's not much difference in these developments",
          "This museum deserves more attention both from the public and from the museum administration. There are some wonderful exhibits and English language headphones make lots of information about individual exhibits available to non-Chinese tourists. There are 15 exhibition halls,",
          "This is a free museum which is rare in China. Not a lot of visitors either, extra rare in China! Exhibits aren't particularly special but the selection is varied with good English explanations. Worth visiting if you have time and wanna escape the heat in the summer.",

          "The Sichuan Museum is definitely a must-see for anyone in Chengdu with a few hours to spare. There are countless artifacts and paintings that you wouldn't be able to see anywhere else. The museum is clean, and the exhibits are nicely layed out and have great English",

          "We stopped at the museum on our way to Dufu's cottage. Could not resist going in once we found out that it is free. I find it a bit odd how in China you often have to get the tickets some distance away from the actual building. But it was free, and all we had to do was present",
          "You have to bring your passport for the free entry . NOT bad for a Chinese museum , 3 floors to cover , Some nice exhibitions .Great oil paintings .A great lesson I the history of Sichuan .",

          "I don't really like the chinese way with museums and this one is no exception. The exhibition is nice but not very organized with almost no english explanations. Go there if you have nothing better to do for an hour or so.",

          "Free entry is a big plus for this place. The museum is spacious, clean and well maintained. The exhibits are clearly bi-lingual but unless you are a pottery buff a little dull. Undoubtedly there are some lovely pieces here loaned from the imperial city in Beijing but not a great",
          "The museum had historical exhibits and had some English translations. Nice to see a focus on the local area and historic artifacts. It is free to get in but you need to show an ID at the ticket window before the museum. It was not too crowded and the largest group were Chinese",
          "The guided tour part made this place for us. I don't know if this was a one off but at the Pottery and Stone section, on the bottom floor, a gentleman approached us and offered a guided tour. I probably learned more about China in the hour or so that we spent with him than I",
          "Items are displayed well, with items having labels in both English and Chinese. It reminded me of the Shanghai Museum, but smaller, the collection is something to see , if you are interested in Chinese art.",
          "The space is big, everything is in Chinese. What i really liked is that the guides are school students, primary school probbaly but they do know or appear to, kjow what they were talking about. At least the groups of people listening to the guides seemed like learning a lot.",
          "Perfecto to go with teh family or alone, bring your passport to get the entrance, it is required.... inside, great colection of nice Chinese art and Sichuan treasures, highly recommended, 2-3 hours should be enough in your plan",

          "A great museum to gain an understanding of the province of Sichuan. Art, crafts, culture -- it is all here, well displayed and interestingly presented. Lot of English language labeling.",
          "The museum is located near the few parks and attractions- Cultural Park, Jinghua Square, Dufu Cottage, Chingyanggong, Baihuatang Park,etc. I was on my morning walk to the parks when I came across the museum. It was about 8.30 am and the security guard told me to come back at 9",
          "Show your passport and you get a free entry to the museum. I would think that the museum has a great collection of artifacts and treasures. 3 floors of it and maybe some personal exhibition in some areas. It's a pity that they do not explain much of the items they collected,",
          "This is a great museum, though it could use a good cleaning. Some of the treasures from the first millennia AD are truly wonderful, especially some of the ceramics. There is good variety here in a spacious, well appointed building. The most amazing fact is the entrance is",
          "The museum of Science and Technology was one I visited as well as the Art Museum next to this one. Astonishing is not a good enough description. In the time I spent here, I had hours and hours of interesting things to see and my friends who spoke English (I cannot speak or read",
          "The exhibition on Sichuan minorities is very interesting! It let's you see something more than regular jade or lacquer utensils that you can find in any museum in China. Minorities have amazing culture, their designs are bright and colourful, and you can even see an exorcism",
          "Depending on your interests, this can be a great place to spend a few hours. Probably less for little kids, if at all. My favorites were the examples of various ethnic costumes, amazing pottery, shadow puppets, and carved horn. Oh, and the Tibet room. I went with my language",
          "First of all, the museum is free. It contains a great collection of pottery and bronzes from the various dynasties that are nicely displayed. The top floor features the culture of various minority groups in China.",

          "It's closed Mondays! Keep this is mind so you're not left disappointed. The parks surrounding it are stunning though.",
          "A little way west of central Chengdu but worth a visit. Good collections of ancient bronzes, Tibetan art, folk costumes, etc.",

          "The Sichuan Museum is kinda slow to visit. Trying to create a museum with limited insight to materials from China's past, which of course, were mostly destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Not much to see but what makes it good to visit is the nearby market area where you",
          "This museum takes in the main facets of Sichuan art and history such as Buddhism, jade, ceramics. bronze, burial practices, folk art etc. There are displays which show how art was created and some that give children an opportunity to learn somethings hands on. There could be",
          "There is someting for everyone. There are swords, coffins, statues, scrolls, Buddas galore, paintings, minuratures, stoneware, and weavings all inside. Everything was well deisplayed and what had english disciptions were well done and at times moving. The downside is somethings",
          "But this was OK. It is a very nice building, good architecture and pretty diverse range of Chinese exhibits.",
          "Been here twice and still love it! Its free - but make sure u bring ur passport or ID along to get your free pass. There are many different things inside from relics to Chinese paintings to introduction of some of the minorities in Sichuan. Beautiful interior. totally worth it.",
          "This is one of a true traditional museum that exhibits a lot of fine Chinese arts, paitings and ancient relics. It\u2019s a big museum so you should walk through it in the circle they have on the museum instruction map. It took us almost 2 hours to go through the whole place.",
          "The Sichuan Provincial Museum is next door to Huanhua Park and is a must see in Chengdu. It is a very modernized museum with free admission. Visitors are supposed to present valid IDs to receive admission. My 6 year old son read all the English captions and enjoyed the visit"

          "Very crowded, but very interesting ancient streets with street food, tea shops and silversmiths. Treat yourself with an authentic, handmade (in front of you) silver piece and enjoy the noise!",
          "This is a super touristy place full of \"silver\" shops and other food that we saw everywhere else - its so crowded we couldn't walk and really wanted to get out of there - if this is your first time in China check it out - otherwise, you can pass.. you have seen this before..",
          "Located just opposite Kuanzhai train station. We really enjoyed visiting and trying the food. We would recommend this but glad we didn\u2019t take the kids.",
          "Allocate a couple of hours to wander this area. Great example of \u201colder times\u201d. Small alleys with lots of shops and eating options. Also here is the face changing opera if you want it. Highly recommended.",
          "Love the architecture of the ancient buildings and the photo ops beside sculptures and especially some of the exterior-wall painting. Lots of Chinese street food options, including roasted pig ear, noses, scorpions and many other exotic delicacies. Lots of souvenir and other",
          "It was lovely time when we went there as it was not as hot and you have time to explore more. Price is ok for things food is good there are few famous sichuan restaurant that suit my taste bud. As the small shops one scare the hell of me for their hygiene wise and ambience. So",
          "A place not to miss if you visit Chengdu. Lots of great shopping and food . It can be quite crowded, especially in the evening so try an ego early.",
          "Too crowded. Food is good, though. You can find authentic Sichuan spicy food and they have very cute papapig cotton candy for sale. You must get one of them if you have kids.",
          "Nice historical area with lots of shops, cafes and restaurants. Very busy with lots of tourists but still very interesting to visit.",
          "I guess it\u2019s a typical tourist trap that is overly crowded and this month with the heat and rainy season does not help to the whole experience",
          "This area has shops and food, it gets very busy on the main alleys but is a fun place to walk around, there are a bunch of places tucked away in between!",
          "Shopping street as others in the China. Many restaurants, bars, street food, souvenirs. Very crowded",
          "The most interesting is the old-fashioned houses, although they are newly built. The shopping atmosphere is crowded and touristic. In fact, you see much. But I did not want to buy anything. It is just to old-China-styled-artificial. Good to visit, but all is too much over the",
          "Excellent renovation work all buildings are amazing you get a feeling of Chinese Architecture. Good choice for a long walk if you want to take pics, try local street food drink tea and buy local delicacies . Once you have entered one souvenir store \u201e you have seen all of them",
          "Although most visitors may be tourist, most don\u2019t know that the area is very historical architecturally. The houses there are the original ancient homes of that area. The owners updated them to be for commercial purposes which turned them into the present day attractions. I went",
          "Well this is a popular place among tourists (mostly from other parts of Sichuan as the Chengdu locals do not shop here). Pleasant enough with a wide range of shops, and good for a few photos if you can keep the crowds out of your photos. Reasonably close to metro station, and",
          "I guess this is the place to go if you want to buy trinkets. By the time I got here I was shopped out, but there were other sights to see worth the look.",
          "Enjoy the traditional and architecture buildings and some local snacks along the three streets at the Alley..",
          "Not worth the time spent getting there, nothing different to many similar places in China with expensive snacks and overpriced tat",
          "Some interesting shops and weird \u201csnacks\u201d (rabbit heads????) but ultimately very commercial Beautiful brown sugar animal creations. Get made up as a Chinese opera star.",
          "This is an upscale version of Jinlin Street area, with bigger shops and better restaurants and it\u2019s much less crowded. It\u2019s busy day and night and always seemed quite safe to us. There\u2019s a lot of street food and ice cream stands as well as high end tea and antique shops.",
          "My teen daughters and I walked here from our hotel and had a great time wandering the alley, enjoying the beauty and architecture of the area. We saw many in large garb walking around. We were there on a Sunday and honestly it was not too crowded. The restaurants all look really",
          "Amazing and wonderful stuff from souvenirs to traditional opera dance to great food.. New hype cafes selling traditional to modern food.. So tempting and u need at least 3 hours to try almost different stuff. A must for locals and foreigners.",
          "The Alleys are very close to People's Park in the centre of the city, and are full of charm and character. Lots of small businesses and restaurants selling their wares and services here with all of the commotion and sounds and smells you would expect from traditional Chinese",
          "We came here twice because we enjoyed it so much. There is a good variety of food on offer and it was not as crowded and overwhelming as Jilin walking street. Highly recommended for some shopping and eating. We also did a tea tasting at one shop. As is the case in most of China,",
          "There are many interesting structures, shops and eateries in the Kuanzhai Alley pedestrian area. We tried some of the street foods, but without being too adventurous. There are many beautiful and unique photo ops throughout the area. It is a sightseer\u2019s haven. It is a good place",
          "Nice and charming alley where the old meets the new. Boutiques, snack shops, restaurants, tea houses, sport bars, art galleries, you can find all kinds of establishments in this unique neighbourhood. It's easy to get to the Alley by public transportation, which has contributed",
          "Lovely narrow streets with lots of shops and places to eat. Relaxed place, no one is giving you the hard sell, a real pleasure to walk around, give yourself a couple of hours to really soak it up",
          "Half authentic, half new, it was a nice place to stroll around. Some things are a surprise to see, then there are things you'd expect at a Chinese alley. Just go with it! We had some lovely little potatoes- eat them with a toothpick, they were a little spicy, but very nice!",
          "Restored alleys with shops and food. LOTS of people. Nothing really special to see, eat, or buy. I wouldn't describe it as \"authentic\" at all. We did stop in to see a show (it was the first such place on the left hand side as you're entering the alley, located on the 2nd floor",
          "A nice place to visit after coming back from the Pandas. Narrow alleyway full of souvenirs, street food, restaurants. A great mix of cultures. Worth a wander Has its own subway so easy to find.",
          "I have visited the place several times. I still remains interesting because each time one could see somewhat different things and people. Quite a crowded place. It has many different kinds of shop, some nostalgic and some modern. Plenty of Sichuan food to choose from and prices",
          "This is a must visit place in Chengdu - visit it both day and night - the feel is different. It is colorful, mix of old culture and the new lifestyle. Always bustling with people and activities. Restaurants, cafes, shops selling various things ranging from fashion to food,",
          "The shopping is really good but the alleys are really so crowded that you get stuck in what\u2019s more like pushing fight to get anywhere .Get there very early before 9am and it is better some very interesting local designer shops and tea houses . Spent too much but the quality of",
          "This is a great place to pick up some local souveniours, lots of shops with their local goods and food. However I find the prices here higher than Jinli, so if you are buying loads, go to Jinli! We went on Saturday so it was VERY BUSY and slightly hectic when walking with a",
          "We would love to have spent more time wondering through this sympathetically restored old Chengdu. The way this has been done is a useful lesson to all wanting to get the best out of their heritage. The shops and restaurants were amazing and you were entertained by clever",
          "Very busy old (rebuild) street. Worth going into all houses. All are souvenirs, tea, wood shops. A good promenade.",
          "Definitely a must see. Unique stores, amazing hot-pot restaurants. Stayed at the WenJun Mansion Hotel - excellent. Very convenient to metro.",
          "Variety of local and fad food and souvenirs. The modernised old structures blends well in the atmosphere of the area. Many restaurants there provide shows, such the Sichuan's fast changing masks and Chinese opera, hence the cost of meals are expensive.",
          "We went there twice in 1day because we had so much fun! There\u2019s street art, shops, and lots of places to eat.",
          "Walked here from the hotel based on a recommendation from the concierge. Interesting place with lots of shops, restaurants, bars and food vendors. Makes for a nice night time activity, but it is a little expensive. Also found out it is a area that was recently built, but it is",
          "We went on a Saturday close to the Qing Ming holiday. It was busy, but not overwhelming by China standards. Lots to see and sample. Plenty of interesting architecture, artisans, food and unrushed corners to enjoy a meal. We came as a family group and all enjoyed the",
          "This place has a rich history and hence it is full of visitors even during wkdays. It has alot of souvenior shops, pubs and snack counters. There are decorations on the walls which depics the ancient story. Interesting place.",
          "The area has changed in recent years. It is no longer a collection of really up-market restaurants, and today houses many moderate low cost local eateries. Several Sichuan face changing shows which may be worth a visit.",
          "Walked here at the suggestion of one of the folks at our hotel. A really eclectic mix of traditional architecture, galleries, shops, bars and restaurants....while it is busy, at least you don\u2019t have to dodge mopeds.",
          "Wonderful to see so many different ways of expose the Chinese culture. We have a nice time walking and appreciating many stores, restaurants, Te houses, etc.",
          "Used to be a great place to visit. Now is a touristy place with low taste. Lost all its characteristics.",
          "I visited here with my friends. There are 3 streets and a lot of shops. The buildings were unexpectedly built recently, though they look like old town. I recommend you will try XiaoChi in this area. These are cheap and delicious. If you\u2019re looking for some souvenirs, you",
          "Spend some time there if you are new to Chengdu. There are lots of restaurants and small eateries to try out local delicacies. There also are interesting shops that make the trip enjoyable. Make sure to take a walk in the different alleys, they lead to different parts of the",
          "These alleyways are perfect for those looking for a gift to take home. Rebuilt in the late 1990s -2000s the shops offer a variety of local crafts and food. A hint to the visitor, use the bathroom before visiting here as the \u2018facilities\u2019 are not great.",
          "Its a good place to shop after day tour, Variety street food with reasonable price, even local people come here fir dinner. My favorite shop here is Panda House which sells panda poducts with a good design.",
          "Standard mix of funky souvenir shops, tea shops, art displays, etc. Very cute, \"cultural\" architecture, but obviously a bit tourist-y. There is a Starbucks, after all. It was fun to wander & pop in the shops, and there was decent coffee to be had. Bar-wise, though, the next",
          "This area is so popular among the locals & foreigners! What\u2019s fascinated me is has a mixed culture between the west & east. All the decor & display of shop front are very trendy & fashionable but with a touch of the chinese culture. Love to visit the tea house!",
          "Loved strolling these alleys even though it was a bit crowded, that\u2019s the downfall, but it\u2019s China expect crowds! Come here with a bit of an empty stomach to get a sample of all the little street foods. This place is a little gimmick (as with any tourist spot) but nonetheless",
          "Great place to buy Chinese gifts and souvenirs. Low end to high end its all here in a great environment of ancient China. We purchased beautiful hand made silver jewelry, perfumes, tea, Chinese nougat.",
          "We walked here at KuanZhai Alley after our dinner and immediately I felt that even if we came here directly for dinner at KuanZhai Alley we would have enjoyed our experiences here. KuanZhai Alley offers a lot of unique night bars with live music, or quiet teahouse to enjoy",
          "We came here knowing that it is a commercial tourist spot with lots of shops and local eateries. We tried quite a few of the eateries and saw a lot of interesting shops. When we got tired, we just stopped at a tea shop and drank some fruity drinks. The place is clean (including",
          "I loved the alleys in downtown Chengdu, both Kuanzhai and the parallel streets, they have unique street sculptures, nice tea houses, Chinese \"Xiao Chi\" (small bites) and fancy restaurants to please the most picky of tourists. A real delight not to miss while in Chengdu.",
          "Really nice spot. Popular with locals & tourists alike so probably better to visit on a weekday. I go every time we come back to Chengdu.",
          "Excellent experience soaking in the architecture and ambience, with shops peddling traditional crafts and foods. Highly recommended to visit. Go early to avoid the crowds, especially on weekends.",
          "Replica street made of old times. It\u2019s nice to see. It takes an hour or two to see everything. Mostly tea houses or shops that sell panda items.",
          "Very pretty streets, since we where there in mid December and it was quite cold, there were not too many people, but I suppose this area gets crowded during high season. Nevertheless it's very pretty, lots of nice doors and good food too. Definitely recommend spending a few",
          "Couple of pedestrian streets full of shops and restaurants. Fairly touristy and not much in the way of historical context. Worth a brief walk through the area and people watch and look through the stores.",
          "Kwanzhai Alley is an interesting place to explore but it is usually crowded, especially weekends and mid-day so plan accordingly. I go to people watch and see short performances of Sichuan Opera Face Changing Shows and shop for touristy gifts. My favorite thing to do here is to",
          "Good to visit if there is time, but for people who generally don\u2019t enjoy spending time looking at architecture structure then no point going.",
          "Every stores and cafe is unique and have beautiful decor. It is worth browsing each of them. My favorite store is \"Swarka\" which has Indian/Nepali theme to it.",
          "This place is like Chinatown of London/New York. When I said this, I meant, it's a re-built place that is meant for tourist. Kuanzhai alley actually made up of 3 parts, the wide alley (Kuan), the narrow (zhai) alley, and the well alley. The busy part is at the wide and narrow",
          "I was full of excitement before visiting the KuanZhai alley thinking that this might be an authentic looking streets from the past. However, the modern looking shops spoil the authenticity of these 2 alley. Just an hour is enough if you only want to walk down these 2 alleys.",
          "Must see place for first time visit in chengdu. Historical buildings with modern shopping concept. Many local street food and art displays. Easily accessible by local Metro service.",
          "Love this place. Very well thought out preservation project turning it into a very touristic place, and a highly successful one too. The concept and architectural planning, commercial fit-outs of the entire place makes one feel like stepping back in time, 300+ years ago into the",
          "Good historic walk thru the wide and narrow alleys of chengdu. Many things to see. Many artists show their skills here. Candy designs can be made in front of you, colorful cotton candy, paper cuts, even dog poop candy.",
          "Just two parallel streets but very colorful and live area. Impressive buildings housing galleries, shops and restaurants. Great place to visit.",
          "This place is quite similar to Jinli Street, full of shops and restaurants. But I find some of the shops here are more well decorated compare to Jinji Street. I enjoyed the Chinese architecture buildings and decorations and took many pictures. No entry fee is required. It is",
          "more expensive than other sites for street food but clean and delicious. also a good place for souvenirs.",
          "I like Jingli lane more, this alley has many nice shops and restraurants but they are expensive than other place in Chengdu, probably because it's too famous and popular. Unless you like to enjoy the wine here in the bars and watch the traditional opera trick called \"change",
          "These are a reconstruction of the old city market alleys - the wide and the narrow streets. They are filled with shops and people, lots of people. It's more touristy but worth a visit.",
          "Lots of tea shops and food stalls / restaurants to explore, and to give visitors a taste of Chengdu culture. If you want the same experience without the crowds (and maybe more authentic), try visiting Kuixinglou Street, a few streets to the North.",
          "Pretty good place for shopping and eating. Many tourists and thus rather packed. Teahouses are plenty and they are a nice place to sit down and rest for a while.",
          "I was very impressed with the Kuanzhai Alley and other surrounding areas. What a wonderful place for tourists - teeming with people but organised chaos, this place has some of the most beautiful shops and lots of fabulous restaurants which provide entertainment including the",
          "Three lanes full of shops, restaurants, snack stalls and Chinese people. So crowded it is difficult to walk especially in the evening",
          "If you like hiking this is the place to be with lots of greenery and flowers.However there is nothing much here",
          "This famous tourist area is also known as Wide & Narrow Alleys. There are three parallel ancient city alleys, named Wide, Well and Narrow as well as numerous courtyards along them. They are popular for tourists as you can see in the photo\u2019s; where there are restaurants, pubs,",
          "Cool but touristy! Lots to eat, lots to look at and lots of people. But fun we came back twice. And ate here twice! Better to come in the evening less people. Starts to get much quieter around 9-930 but will close around 10",
          "1. U can enjoy variety of foods here, rabbits meat, stinky taufu etc.. 2. Combination of few streets. 3. Place for photographs 4. Metro station just in front of the KuanZhai Alley.",
          "Beautiful alleys, shops, nice food, buildings with full of art, very interesting, must do while you are in Chengdu",
          "Kuan and Zhai Alley will provide you with a fusion of modern lifestyle and traditional Chines culture, food and tea house opera. There are plenty of shops to do shopping from traditional handicrafts, spices to silk and modern apparels. Evening would be preferred to visit",
          "A modern twist to the alley way, plenty of shops to look at, snacks, bars, restaurants etc. Clean and convenient to get to to, with its own metro station.",
          "Cultural and historical place with rows of street food including rabbit meat, gosh! Culture Shocckkk!!!",
          "We really enjoyed our day exploring through this part of town. There\u2019s lots to see and eat. Particularly enjoyed the pastry shop. Worth a visit.",
          "The alleyways are quite touristy and commercialised but still good to just wander about,from narrow one to wide one,nice street food",
          "Mostly restored or recreated. It\u2019s a fun destination to visit for local snacks, food, souvenirs etc. We went there in the evening & decided it was worth a second visit during the day. You can easily spend 3 hours there including a break for either lunch, afternoon tea or dinner.",
          "The usual commercialisation of a Chinese heritage area. Traditional architectures mixed in with many restaurants and cafes serving up a variety of cuisines. Weekends are super crowded as usual but you can find a nice place to watch the people walking pass and enjoy a cuppa.",
          "Very well appointed for city tourism. You will feel like walking in the past with lots of historical old building although they are turned it into something else now. You still can see some are kept like it was and well preserved.",
          "I see from comments below that people visiting during the day found the alley too crowded and hectic. We went on a Sunday evening (about 9pm), and we didn't have that problem at all. There were still enough people in the alley to give it atmosphere, but it still felt very calm",
          "I went on a Saturday and it was so crowed and chaotic that I wasnt able to enjoy it. A bit too commercial for me. Recommend Jinlin street instead.",
          "I enjoyed my 1-2 hours here. It is a pleasant place to have a wander around. There are a number of places where you can try different types of Sichuan food. The Wren Restaurant (pictured) was a convenient (although a bit more expensive) way of trying different Sichuan cuisine",
          "There were so many people - domestic and foreignt tourists visiting the 2 alleys. Best to visit in the morning, where there are lesser crowds, so that we you can better appreicate the alley ways and architecture. We visited in July, and in the afternoon, the weather became too",
          "Beautiful area to wander around. More boutique type shops, interesting. Lots of food options, but Western prices.",
          "Yep just like its description Kuanzhai Alley, is a warren of shops in varying sized alleys. We enjoyed wondering around and seeing all sorts of different souvenirs and food. We did prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street for its atmosphere though...",
          "We went here because we heard there was a traditional hot pot restaurant that also had the face changing opera as entertainment. We really enjoyed the traditional Sichuan hotpot and the face changing opera was a real highlight and something that the whole family will not",
          "If you're looking for crowds and overpriced shopping, this is the place for you. This is a popular place for domestic tourists, and the day we were there it was so crowded we couldn't wait to get through it and on to something more relaxing.",
          "this is a very popular destination for a lot of foreigners as well as out of town visitors from other parts of China or Asia. I can't see the attration, unless you've never seen one before. I would say it's ok for a first visit, just to say been there done that. The area is",
          "Prefer Jinli because more picturesque- but if u have time for both, would recommend. Some of the shops are same branch on both streets. Pedestrian only street lined with shops selling local foods, handicrafts and anything else imaginable. Great way to immerse in the food culture",
          "Strolling along the customs & tradition of the locals, a must to visit. The scent of the spicy Szechuan cuisine, its famous chilly & pepper, the traditional stone grinding of red chilly mix with garlic,typical courtyard of the dynasty bordering this stone walking alley makes",
          "This is a good area to wander around for a few hours. Good for street food and souvenirs. There are also great restaurants here which have live Sichuan opera and dance shows.",
          "The narrow and wide alleys (there are three of them in the same area) are great to spend a couple of hours wandering through imagining how it used to be in decades gone by. They tried to keep them as authentic as possible while they serve a modern purpose - shopping, eating,",
          "Touristy but wonderful markets, such a variety of shops and things to eat. You can sit in on a play for a small fee also. We ventured less than 50m from here and found a very local Chinese market",
          "This was a lot like several other pedestrian zones we've visited on our trip. It had a lot of clothing and souvenir shops, many open to bargaining. There were also many places that sold Sichuan peppercorns, peppers, & hot pot concentrate. The street food looked really good, but",
          "Lovely place with a lot of history. Here you can clean your ears, in the old traditional way, for about 60 yuan. Nice restaurants and bars and a lot to see. Crowded place, but very nice.",
          "Yes, it is terribly crowded as are all tourist areas in China. But the ancient architecture, shops, and restaurants offer something for everyone. Lots of Sichuan snacks and restaurants, but also pubs featuring pizza and western food. Touristy \"face changing\" and Chinese opera",
          "Many food, drinks, restaurants, history, shops, souvenirs items and they have a lot to offer. Was great to visit from afternoon till evening",
          "You can wander through the alleys (there are several in this network) to find food, ice cream, souvenirs, and crafts. We found a really pretty handmade silver filigree jewelry store that was stunning. This shop is tucked away in an enclave of other shops, and not visible from",
          "It\u2019s made for tourist and the whole place is usually flooded by tourist from other cities in China. Sometimes locals do venture there for tea as well. If you are visiting Chengdu, might as well come and visit the streets and window shop. No need to buy any of the exorbitantly",
          "I have been to Chengdu three times. The alley is always on my list. Many good tea houses to share with friends.",
          "I went because this was one of the go-to places in Chengdu, and my family was on a group tour. The experience was marred by the holiday crowd (I went on the eve of a long 3 day public holiday), which made it difficult to move, much less enjoy the surroundings. Many parts of the",
          "Lots of places to stop and shop or to stop and eat. God people watching, too. A great diversion in the city. Also within a very short walk to People's Park.",
          "Its a short street with many shops for tourists. Because we were on a hot noon, we didn't do much except walking through the street. We did stopped for lunch. The shop was busy, but the food was a disappointment.",
          "Old street full of restaurants, cafes/tea houses and shops selling souvenirs. Went there at night and it was crowded. Love the ambience.",
          "Lots of interesting things to see and taste. We spent about a hour walking around after dinner. It does get crowded but very civil people. It is vey clean considering the crowds.",
          "Known as Wide and Narrow Alleys, these pedestrian streets have street performers, shopping, and restaurants. It\u2019s a colorful scene and very crowded. Plan on 2-3 hours.",
          "We went to JinLi street during our last Chengdu trip last year and didnt get a chance to come to KuanZhai alley, so we made up for it this trip. well, if you are expecting something similar to JinLI street, ie tonnes of street side food to sample and crowds, then you are wrong.",
          "So much to see and do, shops of every variety, a great many nationalities. Noisy and bustling it was great. Take some time to stop and look, there is a lot to see. Plenty of places for food and drink, and you can even get your ears cleaned (a local speciality). As I am a",
          "This place is as good as it gets if you're a foodie and willing to explore all the different food that is available. Everything my wife and I tried was AWESOME. Lots of great desert type stuff as well.",
          "Cool alleyway with some interesting shops. Lots of tourist shops and panda items everywhere! Plenty of yummy smelling food too.",
          "A restored street built in the style of original architecture. A great place to wander and munch in the food stalls.",
          "We had heard rave reviews about this place, and on arrival we were not disappointed. It looks amazing, and is great to spend an hour or so threading your way through thousands and thousands of other tourists. Some amazing shops and food. The reason for the three stars is that",
          "This is, as may be expected, a commercialised area. Nevertheless, it is worth a visit for the various shops, the wall murals, and probably the teahouses which offer traditional tea in opera houses. For the latter, I suspect that it is better than that at Shufengyayun; they are",
          "Kuanzhai Alley is a historical look alley with lots of shopping and restaurants. There are many for stores for local snack like spiced rabbit head, spiced pig brain...kuanzhau Alley is more interesting than Jinli Street, it is bigger in size and with more options on food. Many",
          "It is interesting to walk around in this pedestrian area. The designed concept is nice and rather attractive with a bit of history. though rather commercialized with all the shops for all kinds of contemporary merchandise.",
          "A few walking streets (wide and narrow, per the name) full of shops and restaurants. Despite some of the signage, there is nothing ancient about it, but there are a lot of options (and tourists).",
          "As written in the title, you'll probably end up here if you go to Chengdu. It's flooded with tourists and local chinese, walking around and lining up for restaurants, coffee shops and mahjong establishments nearby. It's modern, but feels very pleasant and cultural too.",
          "The place full of all kinds of building, you could stroll around watch a traditional Chinese show, including the famous change face mask in less a second right on front of you. All kinds of street foods, all kinds of restaurant. You could drink coffee or tea, relaxing and",
          "Jinli and the wide and narrow alleys are the southern China version of the BeiJing Hutongs, and although these places to me don\u2019t have a really authentic feel about them, I think they are worth a visit... well at least one of them, the question is which one? I\u2019ve been several",
          "Though this is a tourist trap, it's a fun one. Visiting on a Saturday afternoon, the alleys were full of people, though this made for entertaining people-watching. The area is clean for the amount of traffic seen there. The shop buildings are well-restored.",
          "We spent one evening wandering these streets and had a great time. We would have liked more time here but were sadly leaving Chengdu the following day. These alleys are packed full of shops, tea shops, bakeries, restaurants and bars. It was very busy though when we were there",
          "This is a good place to see a cleaned up version of a traditional Chinese shopping/tea house area but don\u2019t go at peak times. I walked through here on a Saturday afternoon on my way back from the Yongling museum and these \u201calleys\u201d were so packed that you could hardly walk.",
          "We spent a wonderful couple of hours walking around this renovated Hutong area. there are a vast number of eating establishments and restaurants to choose from and a good time will be had.",
          "Very interesting area to spend a warm afternoon. Lots of small, but clean shop with friendly owners who don\u2019t pressure with high pitched sales. Recommend Dan Dan noodles at one of the noodle houses. Yummy.",
          "Ancient street, neat, clean and will very crowded if holidays season due to the street is narrow. A lot of local delicacies street foods and Chinese opera face changing show in this street.",
          "Just another pair of Qing-style (emphasis on the word style) streets for busloads of Chinese tourists to walk on for last-minute panda stuffed toys and quick 10 RMB bites (emphasis, too, on the word busloads, because if you stop for even a quick photo someone will start shouting",
          "the streets has so much to offer! basically everything u need from touristic stuff to local food or some real hot spicy food,you name it. but it can be a bit too lousy at times,ppl talk kinda LOUND there, if you know what i mean!",
          "We visited this place as it was recommended by TripAdvisor as one of the top 10 places to visit in Chengdu. It's very touristy, you can buy souvenirs for home here. No bargaining. Most of the time they only accept cash and their local credit card. The many local snacks are quite",
          "They did a pretty good job with this place as far as how it looks, I enjoyed the monochromatic photo/sculpture things on display in the streets. I felt it was a bit nicer/different from most other \u201etraditional\u201c alleys I\u2018ve seen in China, more like a re-interpretation. We didn\u2018t",
          "There's nothing historic here, just a bunch of themed shops that are new, but built in the old style. It takes 20 minutes tops to walk through both if you dont buy anything.",
          "Walking through the narrow lanes of the historic district with many beautiful courtyards you will find different delicious local specialities.",
          "Every time I visit China, I return to the Alleys. I love the hustle and bustle; the cacophony of voices that greets you as you approach. Wide and Narrow Alleys are busy, all year round. You can get away from the shoulder to shoulder crowds by ducking into one of the many",
          "Great place to explore if you don't mind the crowds. There are lots of shops and restaurants and it is in a central part of town.",
          "Great shopping and food. This is a good place to enjoy a tea ceremony and learn about tea. Storekeepers are friendly and not pushy. You will find all kinds of souvenirs.",
          "We visited this place on Sunday so it was rather busy and crowded. We tried a few local delicacies. Tasted good and it was a good experience for us. The Qing Dynasty buildings are good to view. Just that this place has become too commercialised.",
          "We took the sightseeing bus from the panda base to here which costed us 10 RMB and it took around half an hour. We were starving and just went in a place that sell different kinds of snack. The place was packed and we took it as a good sign and it surely didn\u2019t disappoint! I",
          "A collection of 3 streets lined with old fashion looking houses or mansions refurbished into eateries, restaurants and craft shops. Most outlets are welcoming even if you do not intend to purchase anything, they allow you to walk in to admire the refurbished",
          "It's sometimes hard to wrap my mind around the age of China's recorded history. A visit to the ancient city with the enormous wall gives a glimpse of sophisticated society that existed so long ago.",
          "Here, the exterior of each building has been kept as its original looks. Inside the building, new things are exhibited. Thus you can buy something special or stuff with Chengdu style. Also, you can taste transitional Sichuan gourmet.",
          "We were disappointed with these streets. The beautiful old houses were overshadowed by the commercialism - pointless jewellery stores, tacky souvenirs and even a Starbucks. It would have been nice if they'd left the buildings without the need to fill them with tacky shops.",
          "This is not a typical downtown. Most of the boutique here and restaurant were designed culturally. If you were bargain hunter and a food enthusiast, this area is perfect for you.",
          "This street is a must-go in Chengdu, gorgeous little alleyways and reasonably (most of them anyway!) priced shops. Food is a little more pricey, but a lot of places do a Sichuanese opera (the one we saw was completely in Chinese) but I would still recommend even if you are not a",
          "Busy streets with no motorised tragic but very crowded with people. Stores are a bit higher prices as elsewhere but they are also better decorated and good athmosphere.",
          "The wide and narrow alleys are worth a visit. Lots of local restaurants and street food. Also a lot of neat shops that sell spices, crafts and all kinds of souvenirs.",
          "It is like Harry Potter, you run into a wall and enter into another world. Beautiful way of depicting history and art. Don't miss it if you visit Chengdu.",
          "Spending half a day walking up and down these alleys is a great way to get to know more about the cultural heritage in Chengdu. They are within walking distance of the town centre or if you don't feel like it, you can always take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the",
          "After almost two years working around Xichuan Province in China I got a recommendation to visit this place called Narrow & Wide alley (in English). It turned to be one of the best experience in Chengdu. There you can have a real taste of local culture including souvenirs,",
          "It's surprisongly enjoyable visit. There is quite a few things to do especially eating small meals throughout. There is also entertainment such as performances where you can sit down to relax.",
          "It's probably the most famous tourist spot in Chengdu city. So if you come to visit Chengdu, you are more than likely ending up here one time -- and one time is enough. It has been modernized so much that it is clearly catered to tourists -- foreign or domestic. Local people",
          "This pedestrian zone is really a wonderful place for tourists. Yes, it's touristy, but that's because they've done a good job of restoring the architecture to its original beauty and then filled each building with restaurants, shops, food stalls, and tea houses. It was mobbed",
          "Really worthy ur half day time visiting there and try everything you see, I believe you will love it. Do slow down ur steps and enjoy it.",
          "Chinese locals don\u2019t frequent this area as it is catered to tourists. We definitely had fun here as the streets are teaming with happy tourists gathered in small and narrow streets. The buildings are restored to resemble the old Qing Dynasty. You will just follow the crowds of",
          "I visited on a weekend and the alleys were throbbing with life. There are man F&B outlets and some upscale shops but I visited mainly to enjoy the vibrance. The old buildings were beautifully restored and an abundance of trees with green and yellow foliage made postcard pretty",
          "My overall score is three stars: fairly interesting, you won't regret visiting Unlike Jinli Pedestrian Street (see my other review), this area actually does have historical roots -- having been the site of a Manchu garrison -- but much seems to have been recently remodelled or",
          "Kuanzhai Ancient Street is quite famous, but I have been to many other cities in China and most of them have similar walking street. The food there is so so, I have 2 friends lived in Chengdu and they said actully the local doesn't visit this place and told me the food there is",
          "Crowded, lots of shops and trinkets - lots of panda merch but nothing really special. This area has alot of Sichuan opera/changing faces shows. Tickets range from 48 - 88 rmb in most places. I do always enjoy China at night when everything is lit up so if you stay until",
          "We took bus service 57 outside Jinli Pedestrian Walk for CNY1 and took a few minutes walk to this place. There are plenty of interesting shops and many very modern tea-houses here. It was quite crowded during our visit. The Chinese food can be rather intriguing with rabbit",
          "Visited both here and Jinli but I liked this area better as featured more of the teahouses and inns of Chengdu. Any visitor to Chengdu should do either here or Jinli but I recommend this area above Jinli.",
          "Similar to Jinli street, the streets are cleaner, buildings are older. There is a nice Starbuck here worth a visit!",
          "We went twice to the alleys and the best was in the evening when all the lights were on and the lanterns glowing. Some interesting displays and houses if you take the time to look at them as well as a good range of shops.",
          "Some confusion due to the three names in use for this pedestrian street, but certainly more pleasant to visit then Jinli Street. Lots of lovely sculptures - Chengdu has much public art - and Panda related merchandise is cheaper than at the Panda Research Base.",
          "Yes, lots of good shops -- from hammered silver to traditional souvenirs-- but be sure to enjoy the architecture that those ships enhabit. The alleys are very crowded on weekends. We went back during the week and found it much easier to navigate.",
          "walking street in Chengdu... worth spend some time here to explore the few alleys.... good place to take photos as well....",
          "A must go place in cheng du. Interesting food and alleys. Highly recommended. A lot of food and things to buy",
          "Similar to Jingli, lots of shops and restaurants in narrow streets. However, the overall feel is more upscale compared to Jingli. May uniquely designed or decorated stores. The restaurants are more formal, the foods offered are more sophisticated. Worth checking out.",
          "It is located at the downtown of Chengdu, taking Metro (subway) to Kuanzhai Xiang \u5bbd\u7a84\u5df7\u5b50 station is one of the best way to beat the heavy traffic of Chengdu, which cost you approx. RMB2/trip from ChunXi Road (where my hotel located). It is consisted of 3 streets which originated",
          "Busy alleys with some older buildings, many restaurants, opera theatres and cafes , nice for a stroll",
          "This is a very updated tourist attraction in Chengdu, with a Starbucks amongst the streets. It is a pleasant walk to enjoy the Chinese street architecture, and there are plenty of things to shop, eat and observe.",
          "Big and small alleys filled with shops restaurants coffee and tea houses. We went there twice; first to see, second to shop. Most interestong part was to see professional ear cleaners in the streets. We bought tea from the Sichuan tea group as the tea leaves smelled lovely",
          "This place is packed with tourist however, you get to admire the Chinese architecture. Lots of souvenir items to shop and variety of street food to try.",
          "Whilst unquestionably aimed at extracting as much of the tourist dollar as possible the Wide and Narrow Streets attraction is worthy of a visit. You will be delighted with the plethora of fascinating food stalls, restaurants and ice cream shops! If you're after a gift for",
          "I love the architecture on the wall and amazed by them. Rows of shops to pick up souvenirs and street food. A good place for photo taking and strolling if you have some time to spare.",
          "We enjoyed our walk down this street so much that we decided to visit twice during our stay in Chengdu. Both times however it was extremely crowded and difficult to walk through. There are a lot of nice restaurants and cafes to hide away from the crowds when it all gets too",
          "Cute walking lane full of nice architecture, good place to pick up some souvenirs and talk a walk, can be a little crowded though",
          "We spent around an hour to tour this place on our last day in chengdu . As expected this is a tourist place which exists in almost every chinese tourist city . The place was packed with tourists during lunch hour . The three streets were filled with small restaurants selling",
          "We arrived there on a Chinese holiday, the number of people was crazy. A lovely place, things on the walls, Chinese addresses, many restaurants and especially full shops, souvenirs, the perfect place for those who need a few more things.",
          "Similar in concept to JinLi street. However I find the kuanzhai street was more interesting. It was made up of wide alley, narrow alley and wells alley. The former two were more famous and more funfare and crowded while the latter was almost devoided of human traffic. This could",
          "Our tour group was en route to a local Hotpot restaurant for dinner. We had a pit-stop at Kuan & Zhai Alley to wander round by ourselves for an hour. Fascinating place. But for me it will always be remembered as the place I had my ears cleaned! The ancient practice of ear",
          "We went early in the day 9.30am and felt like we had the place to ourselves. By 10.30am the tourists began to arrive. This is more upmarket than anywhere else we had visited in China. The artwork on the walls, the shops, and tasteful designed buildings all add to the ambience.",
          "Like many attractions labeled Ancient, it really isn't that ancient, but made to look that way but with some modern shops and stalls scattered about. Personally I find this rather charming and enjoyable. Lets face it, you can't really create an authentic small ancient street",
          "A commercial street that sells food and souvenir. One of the photo spots charge \u00a510 for admission. Another one is in fact a hotel now. Only those pictures taking from the old street is free of charge.",
          "I read a lot of good reviews about this place. To my surprise, I found it disappointing when I visited. It have a lot of restaurants, street food stands, and gifts shops but nothing really stand out. The only I remember about the place is the stink smell coming from the",
          "This was indeed a very interesting street. A lot of historical building with urban shops and restaurants. pretty street arts and interesting walls. lot of chinese snacks in kiosks and also traditional chinese arts. Beware of the crowds. I also saw the traditional ear cleaning",
          "I preferred this to Jinli street which is more touristy. There was a bustling atmosphere on saturday night. Many bars and restaraunts, shops and entertainments. There are many interesting buildings in the area.",
          "Best thing to do in Chengdu. Tons of famous street snacks. Lots of local street artist and workers. Busy energy from tourists. Loved it here. So fun. Evening is the best time.",
          "a few ancient streets to shop and see. a lot of tourists. lots of shops and restaurants ( chinese opera and gong fu cha). a classic !",
          "The place is crowded, there is a Starbucks (which is not a plus), and it lost a bit of its authenticity. But to get an idea of the ancient city, this is a great place to go. The streets are bustling, there are shops, theatres, antique houses and gardens, and restaurants. The",
          "We're walking around with a local friend and the street, the buildings, the shops, the workshops and the street stalls are a fantastic way to get some taste of old Chinese culture",
          "There're many attractive shops and I could feel traditional atmosphere of China. I really enjoyed delicious meal and coffee here.",
          "very good place. it combined the ancient buildings and modern elements. a great place for shopping, eating, relaxing and experience the local food and culture",
          "There are 2 main streets: 1 wide and 1 narrow.. maybe in terms of older days but seriously u can't see the difference now especially with the crowds when u can't move much. Building structure is very nostalgic and get a good old feel but with almost every shop being souvenirs or",
          "During our visit to Chengdu, we wanted to do some local shopping for gifts, souvenirs and more and was told about an ancient section of Chengdu known as Kuanzhai Alley, built/established during the Qing Dynasty. Now this sounded like a great place to visit. This area consists",
          "The wide and narrow alley was the most polished of all the attractions we visited in Chengdu. It was renovated in 2008 so everything was prestine. There was lots of street art and performers and endless bars and restaurants, and boutique stores. A great place to people watch",
          "Me and my friend went there once during the day and once during the night. Regardless of when you visit, be careful of your belongings as the streets are very crowded. There are a lot of street food vendors, silverware shops and tea houses. Even if none of that interests you,",
          "None of the buildings look genuine ancient. It just looks like one big souvenir shop. And it's really crowded. Perfect place for pocket thieves!",
          "I biked over from where I was staying and enjoyed the place. Some interesting historical sites and nice way to explore. Lots of places to shop if that is your thing also some nice coffee and tea shops. Interesting food items on offer and the usual Chinese friendly merchants.",
          "Amazingly beautiful to walk through ancient buildings left untouched and included in the modern high rise city! Preserving physical evidence of ancestry and leaving it for future generations is just some of the magnificent sites to see around China.",
          "We enjoyed our time wandering the alleys. Plenty of interesting shops to look into and foods to try. Worth a visit and easy to get to.",
          "Lovely neighborhood of homes and businesses with ancient architectural style, tea houses, and many shops. Lots of food vendors.",
          "This is actually at least three (3) small street, parallel to each other, in a compact area just slightly west of Tianfu Square and very slightly northwest of People's Park (both of which you must also visit). They are similar to Jinli Street in that they are narrow, for",
          "Plan on spending a entire day here, there is a lot to see and take in, this is just like going back in time and walking down the streets of yester-years, you will simple enjoy and bring your billfold.....many things to see and watch....",
          "This isn't authentic, it is crowded, and it is expensive. But there are also good bars, some decent food, and a fun night out.",
          "These few streets are little touristy gems. The old style architecture gives it a very unique feel in a large city rapidly developing. Lots of people but you're on holidays so taking time is what you do. We wandered around for just over an hour. It does have an almost upmarket",
          "I prefer Jinli street than this narrow and too crowded shopping street. And almost all eats and desserts are quite like the ones at Jinli Street. So just came here to have a quick look and tasted some of the snacks. Watch out for the infamous San Da Pao, its like mochi",
          "Many people for sure. Worth to come here to see the buildings which preserve the old Mengchu style architecture. A lot of coffee shop, hawkers food and restaurant. I saw the American chinese chef Martin Yan went inside one of the restaurant for video shooting. Hire a guide,",
          "We had so much fun strolling in Kuanzhai alley as it consists of Wide Alley, Narrow Alley and Well Alley.Wide and Narrow Alley is one of Chengdu's historical and cultural reserves. Very crowded with tourists but you still have room to take photos. Yes, here you still can try",
          "Nice Alleys to stroll. There are 4 alleys with different era architectures. You can get the feel of the old time villages along the alley.",
          "The narrow & wide alleys have some interesting artwork. The tiny shops are not much different from anywhere else in China. Only worthwhile visiting if you haven't got much on.",
          "This is a very representative historic place at Chengdu. Very clean, though crowded, as in many scenic places in China. The restaurants worth a try, and the cost is fair in general. Hot-pot is highly recommended.",
          "full of shops and it's a good place to buy souvenirs. Wouldn't suggest dining here though there are quite a number of restaurants.",
          "Fun short little walk down a tourist trap of a shopping area. The Starbucks was well designed to look Chinese. Many of the building are either old or renovated to resemble an ancient look. Ok place to get touristy trinkets. No need to book a tour as its easy to access via",
          "This street is much better and more spacious than Jingli street. Same kind of situation with stalls selling all kinds of food and souvenirs. However this area has more restaurants and cafe type establishments than Jingli. I suggest going after sunset so that there's less people",
          "Really enjoyed walking through the Kuan, Zhai and the adjacent Well alley. The buildings were well preserved and the area was very lively with tea houses, shops, ear cleaning 'stalls', street performances. Look out for the bronze statues/wall panels with informative write ups",
          "This is one site with historical values of Qing Dynasty in Chengdu. Apart from the ancient background, it has a variety of other attractions such as shrines, the traditional production of local food.",
          "There were so much teahouses, cafes and interesting shops. There's a good balance of new and old shops for one to spend time walking leisurely down and you wont have to worry getting lost. The streets are pretty simple",
          "Certainly one of the nicest areas of Chengdu ! ( Much better than Jinli Street ) . The shops sell quality items , and you feel free to stroll around leisurely without being pushed by overzealous vendors ! And you are greeted with a smile....",
          "I enjoyed a lot the visit even though it was not included in our already organized tour and the guide subtlety suggested \" it was expensive \" we decided to go by ourselves . Metro reachs one of the extremes of the alleys . We did not think it was expensive at all , found",
          "Lovely place..with lots of shops and interesting architecture. If you want to buy panda soft toy, the shop outside the alley got good choices and reasonable price too. The subway station is Kuanzhai alley(something like this).",
          "Having visited few other valleys in China, including Beijing, i find this is a very nice place to visit. Can easily spend half or even one day here at leisure. Goods and food sold here are reasonably priced without having to bargain much and items are pretty unique. Many",
          "Renovated buildings with cute retail shops and restaurants. Like many tourist areas, packed with people but well worth the visit. Food stalls with everything from cotton candy, mango drinks, rabbit heads, squid sticks, tofu and more. Restaurants were a bit pricey for China.",
          "Similarly to Jinli, these are traditional alleyway streets. I did prefer these streets to Jinli but that is just a personal preferences. It's more of a courtyard-village alleyway. It has gone through relatively recent renovations so it does have a more clean feel than Jinli. It",
          "Just back from a visit to the street. Very orderly, clean and organized. This attraction can be reached by subway. This afternoon while I was there it was mainly locals and I could not pick out any foreigners from the crowd. Straight streets of shops on either side and at least",
          "very easy to find as it is right next to the metro exit and there are signs to point you to the alleys. Unfortunately it is packed with tourists so isn't that easy to walk around (we went during non peak season. can't imagine how bad it gets for peak season). Loads of",
          "Can walk from Tianfu Square and Renming Park from here. The alleys have been preserved from ancient dynasty. Food overpriced but worth a try",
          "Be prepared for crowds especially if you're there during a holiday but enjoy the very many shops and restaurants you're sure to find. We enjoyed Sichuan lunch with live entertainment at Chengdu Ying Xiang (Zhai Xiang Zi). We had prior reservations and a great table in front of",
          "We went on a weekday afternoon in March and there were a TON of people. It was hard to make sure we did not get separated, that's how many people there were. But it was still a cool experience, with lots of little shops and tea gardens hidden in little pockets of the street.",
          "A wonderful place and historical street that u must visit if u are here . All houses are old and beautifully built . They transformed them into shop or restaurant. It's crowded even weekday , so I recommended u come only during weekday . The Starbucks is so historical and",
          "Many shops and restaurants there! But I personally do not like over developed and commercialized tourist spot.",
          "This is a \"must-do\" in Chengdu but really it can be passed unless you have time to spare. We went on a Friday at around 2pm and it was insanely packed with local tourists with selfie sticks and tour groups. It was totally overwhelming. On top of that, maybe it was charming in",
          "We were really looking forward to wandering around here, however we're a little disappointed. Although lovely to look at, and interesting in places, we didn't really enjoy much more... The crowds were crazy with rude people pushing you, stopping in front of you and taking",

          "I went there on my last day of Chengdu trip, it's such a pity that I did not bring enough money. So many cute characters from the past dynasty. Though my advice is that, do not buy from the shops inside the alley (you can't bargain the prices either), there is one shop outside",
          "We stayed right next to Kuanzhai Alleys when we visited Chengdu and wandered around here quite a lot to visit restaurants and eat good food. We were never disappointed! Even simple little restaurants in this neighbourhood serve delicious, fiery food. Plus the atmosphere of",
          "Well worth a stroll. Interesting glimpses into the past in terms of artefacts, good and entertainment. Plenty of tourists, local and foreign wander through old buildings that connect to another street. Check out one stall that offers postcards with a difference!",
          "These streets are similar to Jinli but feature more higher end Sichuan Restaurants with performances that would be suitable for dinner. Lively area for handicrafts, snacks and local flavors.",
          "This area is nice for walking around and people watching. It reminds me strongly of many other \"old towns\" in china. Still, nice enough. Lots of shops with normal Chinese touristy stuff. Very little really unique. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants.",
          "Nice and great place for shopping. Have variety of choice and reasonable price. Not too pack with people. Have beautiful ancient place to take pictures and hang out at classy style of starbuck",
          "This is a fun place with alleys for eating, shopping and enjoyment. The focus is local crafts where one purchases gifts to take home. Obviously, it is quite \"touristy\" and many shops selling identical goods. There are three alleys and many artistic walls. Goods are a little",
          "Enjoyed the restaurants, face changing performances, the street food and the souvenir shops. There's a subway station right at the entrance.",
          "Came here just to kill time, but had enjoyed the trip. We didn't buy anything but just walked down both streets, window & people watching. There are lots of shops & eating places. The streets were crowded as it was Saturday but many obnoxious people kept gawking at a black",
          "We have heard of many such ancient and touristy streets in China. Many of them turned out to be a disappointment due to the poor balance between preservation of heritage and commercialism. Thus I was sceptical when I found out about this ancient street. This was my 2nd",

          "This is a cultural heritage left from the Qing dynasty. Now it offers restaurants housed in the historical buildings from that period, and various art and souvenir shops. Only two long Main Streets. It takes only 20 minutes to just browse thru them. Always crowded. Definitely a",
          "I have this place a 4 instead of a 5 just because it's smaller and less exciting than Jin Li, but still a must see! I love the cultural atmosphere of the wide and narrow alleys, and a great place to just walk around in fascination from everything that you see. From unique",
          "the atmosphere was great, felt i was sent back to china in the traditional era. Tried a couple of the street food, even though some of them were a bit expensive but it was great! a couple of german restaurants that had nice interior and great customer service as well.",
          "Nothing exciting - a very bustling tourist area filled with expensive souvenir shops and restaurants. Spent 15minutes to walk the whole thing and left. Nothing to write home about unless this is your first time in china. Take a brief walk if you have absolutely nothing to do",
          "Shopping, restaurants, bars, art & Sichuan Opera all in 3 well kept alleys. We saw the opera here (more variety show than opera in western definition) as we didn't want to dedicate a whole evening to it. 45 mins was enough & required no booking in advance",
          "This street area is billed as a must see for tourists- it is pretty but like so many places such as this around the world it is a sterilized version of the local culture. I strongly suggest walking the back streets of Chengdu to visit the local markets. This area has gift shops",
          "Interesting place. Street where rich families of Chengdu used to live. Some are still occupied. But nothing breathtaking",
          "We didn't have much time to play tourist however, this area was full of history and was very convenient to where we were staying.",
          "Maybe there was an ancient street at some point, but nowadays its different stores, restaurants and souvenir shops. Looks cute but all buildings look new. It wont take you long to see all three streets. But go there only if you have free time and if you already visited all main",
          "nothing special. you can find it in every tourist cities in China with different street names. If you are coming to China first time maybe worth to visit it.",
          "Kuan Zhai street is the best to walk and you will find lots of restaurants as well street food. You can finish the walk in around 40-45 min walking slow and experience the few local designers selling there products.",
          "Highly recommended. They surely have some interesting stuffs for everyone of you. You can also get your local snacks at those shops just outside before you enter into the alleys. Interesting place for me and everyone should try go there for a feel of Chinese culture!",
          "I came here 3 times during Chengdu trip. The first time was at night, after coming back from JiuZhai Valley. The 2nd time was the next day (on day time) and the last one was on the last day of the trip. To these ancient Street like Kuanzhai, you should visit on day time and",
          "Nice atmosphere with old houses, shops, eateries and performers. Also have gardens and places to rest, though plenty of people so need to squeeze. Good connectivity to public transport and security good too.",
          "We were quite dissapointed with this Alley. Its food are all very pricy and not much souvenior is available. But if you walk right to the end of the alley. There is a part where you can see the actual life of Chengdu people. Things are much cheaper there. Its something like a",
          "This is similar to most old towns in China which means it's not real. Most architecture and buildings have been rebuilt recently. Kuanzhai is also known as wide and narrow alley. There are 3 parallel alleys. 90% of the area is occupied with souvenir shops, restaurants and",
          "We really enjoyed walking down the street and seeing all the sights. There are a lot of souvenirs on sale here and there's lots of snacks you can try. We saw a lot of tea houses and restaurants but we didn't try any. You can also get your ears cleaned which we didn't try, but",
          "if it's your first time in China you will probably love this place. The buildings are beautiful and there is many shops where you can buy all sort of things. For me personaly is not that exciting since I've seen a lot of this kind of street not only in Chengdu but also in",
          "The Wide and Narrow Alleys provide plenty of material for people-watching and photographing. The atmosphere is that of an old city street with vendors and stores lining both sides. I really enjoyed the photographs that are partly 3D on the street walls. There is historical",
          "Although its just 3 streets of shops, we felt its more cozy than jinli and has wider walkway than jinli. It is more shopperble and some shops accepts international credit cards. Recommend the \u4e00\u9488\u4e00\u7ebf hand embroidery handbags. And we bump into a small tibetian incense stalls which",
          "Good place to buy trinkets and gifts. Lots of nightlife and restaurants to enjoy. Saw a nice show with a dancer who could quickly switch masks . Also a really cool looking starbucks if you are into that .",
          "My 2nd time here, I love here very much because is very beautiful street, a lot of food, a lot of beautiful thing. You can look tradition, cultural, modern at the same time. Here is a lot of souvenir. Please come to visit.",
          "This is a must visit place when you are in Chengdu. It is touristy however the well preserved buildings of historical Chengdu are interesting to see. The place also serve many local delicacies and modern fares.",
          "This place is very well conserved and now turned in a tourist attraction. A must visit to see the culture of chengdu and china. There are food stalls, restaurants, tea houses, boutiques, gift shops, Chinese operas, antiques, etc. Easily 2 hrs and the place is clean.",
          "Went there with my family for a stroll. Was very impressed with the cleanness of the place. Surprising the prices for the items from street Hawkers in push cart are fixed. No bargaining. A lot of interesting food to try out. I tried the famed rabbit meat but found it too",
          "Kuan ZhaiXIangZI is a famous sightseeing in Chengdu. Many visitors came there and left a really good comment about it. With many restaurants and clubs here, if you are a traveler who likes beer and food, you will have much more there at night. Comparing to Kuan ZhaiXiangZi, I",
          "This place is a must see while in Chengdu although you will not find any Pandas here other than the plastic ones! Within this area you will find a great deal of food and souvenirs, all very authentic. There are also several venues for the Facing Changing Opera shows. This is",
          "Fantastic little wide and narrow lanes, with plenty of random shopping, food and tea houses. Can get very busy in some parts. Only two stops down from Tianfu Square train station.",
          "Every place in China that is attended to, cared for, kept in a proper state, is a tourist attraction. Like a Swiss tourist village. Chinese people come and look how nice a place can be if one pays some attention to beautification and decoration. That is all the attraction in",
          "This is my second time visit to Kuanzai Ancient street. It is easy accessable by taking subway line 4 drop off at Kuanzai Street station. Basically as it is one of the famous tourist spot so it will always crowded with people either local or foreigner. Shops available selling",
          "If you go in the evening it is more beautiful with the lights on, but expect a lot more people. It was fun to walk trough but after a while we got tired of people bumping into us all the time.",
          "Nice looking area but getting commercialized now, even a starbucks on the street :) interesting shops, and some traditional foods and treats worth seeing",
          "The place was very crowded since it was a saturday afternoon and the weather was perfect. Many interesting food and wares were on sale. It features plenty of everything, i.e local food, ancient products and tourist souveneirs. There was only 1 public toilet at the entrance.",
          "You can find some cute and reasonable gift at those panda souvenir stores. Clothing and gifts are overpriced. Walk over 3 more streets you can find some local restaurants If time is not an issue. Traffic can get worse during school hour around 8:30am and 4:30pm. Overall it's a",
          "Great place to sample street food and people watch. Quirky shops. Lots of places to sample tea. Very busy.",
          "These streets are touristy and commercialised. Everything looked pretty new to me and people seemed to be lapping that up.",
          "Reserve two hours or more for this spot. There are some ancient buildings, interesting architecture, coffee shops and bars, with a fusion of modern and cultural style.",
          "Great street for shopping and tea houses. Very crowded, but not a problem. Prices are ok, you can probably spend a few hours there",
          "There are a lot of restaurants, shops and kiosks. I had a hot-pot dinner which was very spicy. It is a very famous attraction so there was a lot of people.",
          "Fun place to visit! Go at night. You can easily get here using the metro. There are a lot of restaurants! The food isn't the best one i had in China so far but the location is nice!",
          "Great for getting little bits and bobs for the family/friends. Prices are reasonable. Lovely traditional buildings.",
          "I have spent here one evening looking for a place to have dinner. The biggest problem is that basically no restaurant accepts credit cards so you need to have a lot of cash with you. If you look for an European style restaurant after some days of Chinese restaurants I recommend",
          "The Alley (street) isn't that long but quite interesting. Spent a couple of hours exploring the shops, some new some older. Some of the original buildings are still standing. Quite a tourist attraction with many bus loads of visitors arriving throughout the day. Worth a look if",
          "Good one. Three busy alleys arranged in parallel order. You can buy souvenirs there and simply taste old China. Must see if you are in Chengdu!",
          "One of the \"must visit\" place if this is your first time to Chengdu. There are few restaurants, pubs & teahouse for you to choose, to sit down and chi chat with friends. There is one section whereby you can take some nice photos with the 3D walls.",
          "If u want somewhere relaxing to spend your afternoon, kuanzhai is a good choice. Although commercial and crowded with tourists, still good to find some interesting shops and bars to spend your day.",
          "This place is a proof to the fact that not all touristy place are necessarily bad. It is lively, colorful, interesting and full of action. Definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. Restaurants are expensive by comparison to other local joints.",
          "We very much enjoyed strolling around this beautifully restored old Chengdu pedestrian area, full of residents and visitors enjoying the Autumn Moon Festival. Filled with nice shops, restaurants and tea houses, it was a fun way to spend an afternoon.",
          "The wide&narrow lane. Originally from the Ming dynasty..half is old, other half is renovated to shops/restaurants. In ancient times a lot of soldiers came to this area, the narrow street for the normal soldiers (now only Chinese street food) and the wide lane for the horses &",
          "Cool place to walk around. Was easy to taxi over from Du Fu Cottage. The eateries seemed a bit overpriced, perhaps a bit touristy. Some good street food options.",
          "A lot of restaurants, bars, street vendors and different shops. If you even have no intention to buy anything, it's very nice to wonder around. You can easily spend 2 hours there just looking and taking pictures.",
          "Typical chinese pedestrian street , with tea houses, vendors selling Chinese souvenirs. A bit pricier than Jin Li pedestrian street. Very crowded on public holidays so best avoided on those days.",
          "Fun to walk through the alleys and look in the shops, Very crowded but still a good time. A lot of cool things in the walls to take photos with and of! Stop and have lunch or some tea and people watch!",
          "We enjoyed the trip to KZ Ancient Street very much. There were many interesting little shops selling souvenirs as well as cafes everywhere along the walking street. There was also a Starbucks with Chinese style architecture. Even if you are not a fan of shopping, this place is",
          "Experienced the local delicacies and culture at these streets. Got some nice little souvenirs for family and friends here as well.",
          "Good place to spend a couple of hours on souvenir shopping. Some stores are a bit pricey so bargain.",
          "I had first visited the Kuan Zhai Alley before going to the Jinli pedestrianised area the following day. Both are pedestrianised areas showcasing some old houses that had been restored or renovated, souvenir shops, food stalls, restaurants, performances. If you are at Kuan Zhai",
          "Too busy to the point you want to get out like now! - it's attractive but very very touristy! High end shopping - not cheap.",
          "A compact area with a very wide selection of restaurants and shops. Good for a stroll and there's something in every price class. It's doubtful that anything is more than a few years old, but it's built to mimic the older styles and it does look nice. If you're in the area",
          "We toured the street after the temple as they are adjacent. Mostly vendors selling the same stuff you see everywhere and lots of food booths, with exotic meats like Yak and then the duck, rabbit heads and other animal parts.",
          "We walked here from our hotel as it was only 10 mins away. We did enjoy ourselves, there's plenty of shops, bars and places to get food. It does feel a bit like Jinli's poorer cousin. It has much of the same type of shops and food, but it's just not as big. On the plus side",
          "In contrast to Jinli, Kuanzhai is a tastefully attractive ancient style street with some nice shops and restaurants, well suited to a pleasant walk before or after dinner in one of the many restaurants.",
          "A very cool place to site see, shop and eat! We visited with friends do had translation handy to ask questions and try to help talk down prices.... As it says the wide and narrow streets are full of history and culture... A must see",
          "Artsy crafty shops without the usual tourist rubbish. clearly this area has been developed to attract tourists and diners alike. Worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful old streets which showcase the traditional architecture in a modern setting. Beautiful place for a stroll in the early evening. Be warned that it is a tourist hot pot and as such the prices are a little higher than else where but certainly worth it!",
          "We didn't really appreciate the spot. So many people were there it was impossible to walk through in a regular pace. People pushing from every side and merchants praising their articles aggressively made for bad vibes of these alleys. I'm sure the alleys would have been nice,",
          "Lotsa Chengdu souvenirs available at great bargains! especially panda items! there are several shops where you can watch 'changing face' Sichuan opera. I paid 38 yuan for one show that lasted about 1 to 1.5 hours. You can also get your ears cleaned at stalls along the lanes but",
          "I prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street than here as it is smaller but more crowded with similar local shops and food. Easier to get here from train station by just 5 mins walk. Only good point than Jinli if you don't have enough time.",
          "Wide and Narrow Street is one of my favorite areas in Chengdu. I love walking the small alleys without having to worry about traffic, bikes, and scooters. The area is a major attraction and is almost always guaranteed to be filled with throngs of happy tourists taking pictures",
          "The whole place have been rebuilt and just kept in the old style. It is really too commercialized. Tides of people there even on weekdays. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to spend a quiet time. There are some old towns around Chengdu which I really appreciate!",
          "For gifts for the folks back home, is a nice place to go. There are many shops from cheaper items to some very expensive items so it will satisfy most any budget!",
          "We headed there for lunch after seeing the pandas. The taxi ride took forever. We chose a lovely courtyard and had simple Chinese lunch. The street can be so noisy but the courtyards are lovely and quiet. Make sure to have some Koeko (or similar) ice-cream. Tastes like in",
          "I've been here so many times. I used to work at a school right around the corner... Rainy days are the best because there's very little if any people out there. Usually it's so crowded and uncomfortable otherwise... They do have great food and the architecture does represent the",
          "First, I have to say we are not big shoppers. However, the street is worth the experience especially if you can find you way into a courtyard to escape the pushy crowds.",
          "The streets north of these were much more interesting and full of local restaurants and locals. This street was interesting because of all the Chinese tourists and gift shops.",
          "Such a lovely street to walk down in the evening, lots of Chinese street snacks on offer, lots of cheap souvenir stores, lots of restaurants and there's always something going on here. Very vibrant and don't be afraid to try new things. When I was here it started raining but it",
          "That is the question: Wide and Narrow St or Jinli Pedestrian St? If you have time, do both. If not, here's my take (after having visited both): Wide and Narrow is easy to get to by Chengdu Metro and a smaller in terms of overall area than Jinli. I thought Wide and Narrow St",
          "The wide and narrow alley has a lot to offer. From all the tea houses that you can also catch a Sichuan Opera show, to the tea house/pub to grab a bottomless tea or a pint of beer. Add all the souvenir shop to the mix, you got yourself a great way to spend an evening. There",
          "Great shops and restaurants, and food stalls - interesting souvenirs for sale, good quality things. Nicely kept, clean and tidy. Interesting art display aswell.",
          "If u like historic and ancient building, this is the place. There's one place name Chinese Art and Craft Living Museum which is newly opened. Love the craft there, those statues are just so beautiful .... feel calm and excited there",
          "This is an interesting example of the old Chengdu streets made touristy for today's market. Full of Chinese tourists. We were the only Europeans in sight. Lots of food places but all look touristy, worth a look but not something to worry about missing. There seems to be quite a",
          "Marginally more interesting than JinLi. Better, more authentic restaurants can be found on North Xi'an road, a ten minute walk northeast.",
          "The street is very nice but very expensive and extremely crowded. Wouldn't buy a thing there, but definitely nice experience. And the entire area is nice",
          "We have been here twice.- during the day and at night. The buildings are amazing. We went into one place for lunch. When you walk into the doorway there were trees growing and tables around the area. The menu was completely in Chinese but we chanced ordering from the pictures",
          "Another ancient street in Chengdu, which lacks behind Jinli street. No matter at which time of the day you come, there are always massive crowds. While the ambiance in general is very nice, this destroys the experience. The stores are nice and of upper price level. Don't come",
          "Touristy spot in Chengdu and crowded at night, but really fun to stroll around. Many souvenier stores, restaurants, bars and food stands. Traditional Chinese houses make out the atmosphere of this place. Many photo opportunities including the on streat ear treatment and crispy",
          "Another interesting place to visit in the area. Bustling ancient street market, old buildings in true ancient Chinese style",
          "An amazing street with several old buildings Definitely bargain for prices here. Start with half the price and they will probably come down a significant amount. There is an amazing tea house you should visit here just to see it. It's very traditionally made such as several",
          "We received directions to this street but were almost lost. Unfortunately Chinese people could not explain how to get there due to language problems. We visited on a saturday night in the Chinese holiday season and it was crowded. After a while we noticed that wre were on a",
          "Very nice area to eat and go out in the evening. A lot of very stylish bars and many restaurants with many choices what to eat.",
          "The place was packed on a saturday but very lively with interesting shops, found a bar on the \"narrow\" lane which made for a nice respite.",
          "This is one of those old/ renovated street complexes,, a tourist magnet, which is to be enjoyed with your ears and eyes.The architecture of the houses lining the streets is something for history buffs. The stores are as usual touristy, mostly for domestic consumption",
          "This is a great place to find the souvenirs you need to take with you. Many shops and stalls, plus good dining facilities for local food/. Worth the trip.",
          "We re so happy to come to this place...yes it is crowded but you cant buy the atmosphere and the ambience of the this vicinity.... The shop sells range from traditional chinese foods to silverware and jewelry. The safety was ok as we saw a lot of police present in the area.",
          "There are a lot of stalls and food vendors selling food and products there. Great to wonder round at night time. Things close up at about 10pm, with a few bars staying open.",
          "If you are familiar with China, I am not sure of the value-added. But if not, then it is on the metro-line and it does offer traditional 19th century architecture (60% authentic, 40% reconstructed in the same style). Souvenir shops, tea houses and street food vie for",
          "Do go earlier if you want to take noce photographs of the place. May take 2 hours or more to really walk through the lanes. Good for buying little souvenirs and wating local snacks",
          "Visited on a rainy weekday eve but was still enjoyable. Lots of quirky little shops mainly selling touristy items, lots of street foods and restaurants. A good place to have a walk around and easy to get to as close to the metro.",
          "nice tourist spot with street food and very good hotpot! I like narrow street more than wide street and is worth visiting at night!",
          "The things in this street are slightly pricey as it's a popular tourist area but you could find great food and really nice hotpots in the area with nice decorations, it's a place worth visiting and especially at night it can look pretty different from when visiting in the",
          "I know, I know, it's newly built and not authentic - but it's a great fun place to visit after you paid cultural dues to those authentic sightseeing places and need panda souvenirs, tea, delicious street food and entertainment! We loved streets wide and narrow, it's a belly and",
          "This is another make-over traditional looking pedestrian street. Like many others in Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities, it offers traditional snacks, some live performance of how the food is cooked. If you have a few hours to kill, this is a place to hang around to soak",
          "Historical homes are now shops and tea rooms. Again, little difficult in the rest room category for Western visitors. Practice those squats, ladies!",
          "Having been called as the namecard of Chengdu by many tourists, Kuanzhai Alley( Broad&Narrow Street) has attacted many new traveller's attention. With three alleies lying paralleledly, each one has its own uniqueness. As a local girl and guide, i think the reason why Kuanzhai",
          "These streets are great for people watching, shopping, eating and just browsing. There are shops for every pocketbook and interest. Walking through this area is a must for any visitor to Chengdu.",
          "Our guide Cecilia brought us to this street and WOW it is amazing totally loved this, lots of character and lots of very talented people. We love going where the locals hang out! Lots of variety here, from handmade cavings and sugar art, to hot pots, tea shops and great silk",
          "The Wide and Narrow streets are worth a visit, lots of restaurants, can be busy but pleasant to walk around",
          "Was nice wandering through the 2 alleys. Especially enjoyed the hot, fresh snacks which were all 10 yuan. Try the spicy silken tofu - it was popular food good reason. Also the hot pineapple rice.",
          "This is a fun touristy area with lots of folks walking around in the evenings. There is a lot of shopping and there are several restaurants. There were some street performers, and the bars had a lot of performers too.",
          "During our private tour with Aline we stopped on the way back to our hotel on the Wide and Narrow Street. This is a shopping and street food area that is fun to visit and shop. We did actually find a couple of souvenirs as gifts for family at home here. Very interesting area,",
          "We thought it would just be another commercial street selling the same souvenir all over the street. It was so not that! The buildings are refreshingly Chinese and the merchandise is top notch. We also had the best dandan noodle in one of the restaurants. Would have stayed",
          "a little bit of chinese history, nice shops, good restaurants, old tradition meets modern tourism . . . it is a really nice place to visit especially in the evening, when the lights go on and everything is colorful, the heat of the day slowly ceases and you enjoy sinchuan with",
          "It has nice architecture and a nice atmosphere (I went during daytime), so it's great for window shoppers. However, the items are overpriced. It's still worth a visit if you enjoy casually walking and looking at random things!",
          "Really great place to try some great food, souvenirs, and plenty of interesting things to see! Really would recommend, day or night. The way to the dragon is a great hot pot dinner with Sichuan opera on Saturday nights. A great show and meal! Definitely try to visit",
          "Quite a nice and clean place (for China standards), lots of street food and tea houses around but other than that the shops didn't appeal to me. You can probably go there to take some photos. The place was smaller than expected.",
          "Yes, it's a bit touristy, but it also is very domestic, i.e., filled with locals. Just a wonderful place to wander aimlessly, chose a restaurant or street food, watch people, and enjoy the hot evenings. Highly recommend allowing a couple of hours to just experience the",
          "A crowded place that full of different street food and some Sichuan style tea houses. The streets are not wide and keep those old architectural objects or style. Perhaps, a bit too crowded but it's the way that attracts people and tourists. However, it stills a nice place to",
          "A great place for tourists who like markets and interesting different things to look at. Lots of local food to try, but also extremely crowded when we were there. All part of the genuine China experience.",
          "With so much restoration these \"ancient\" streets all looked the same to me. Their original identity is lost and replaced with an idealised version of an old street. Having said that, I would recommend seeing one ancient street during a trip to Chengdu. I thought Jinli Street",
          "This is quite similar to Jinli pedestrian street but without the gardens and pond. There are plenty of restaurants and shops selling souvenirs. Tea houses are everywhere but you can also find Starbucks and some local coffe cafes. The teahouse close to the exit by the main road",
          "My sister and I stayed at a hotel close by Kuanzhai last November so we went through the streets several times during our 4 day stay. The experience you have willl differ depending on how busy the area is. We had tea in the area on a Sunday afternoon and there were tons of",
          "Though it's going to be touristy no matter when you go, this is a nice area to walk through. Recommend it for families with kids, and it is fine for strollers. We enjoyed stopping in kiosks for snacks along the way--yogurt at one place, tofu in another, small savory dishes--and",
          "A tourist area that has been recreated to resemble what the architecture may have looked like at the time, but it is then populated by tourist trap restaurants and shops. A lot of tourists (but I was there on the weekend to be fair), but as an experience it wasn't all that fun",
          "Crowded and touristy (mostly in-country tourists)- but there are some architectural gems like old courtyard houses. There are also many food stalls and vendors selling local street food as well as ear-digging services (yes!) - all that creates a noisy festive kind of atmosphere",
          "This is a very crowded pedestrian street, with lots of small shops selling trinkets and food. A nice place to walk and eat tidbits, if it wasn't so crowded",
          "We went to the Wide and Narrow Streets on a Wednesday night and didn't find it too crowded. There are lots of shops and you could spend quite a while browsing all different types of items! There is a stand where a man will paint your name and a poem in Chinese, and there are all",
          "The streets are full of shops and kiosks. Not particularly interested. There are some old classic Chinese houses and now converted into a restaurant, we went inside to take a look but it was just too crowded so we didn't have a chance to venture more.",
          "I checked out this area at the advice of a guide I had in the city. I was on my own and there were some sections that were very crowded. It was a fun place to walk around still with lots of shops and food.",
          "Lots of Chinese food, you can find some souvenirs here, especially on the pedestrian crossing bridge on the end of street",
          "A maze of one-storey buildings housing a variety of restaurants and stores selling artwork, tea and souvenirs. The area is clean and popular.. We were told to be careful of pickpockets if only because of the crowded narrow streets. It is more touristy than authentic, but",
          "can spend an hour or two strolling the 3 streets. you get many tea houses, shops selling knick-knacks of sorts and souvenirs. walking around in cool weather is quite enoyable",
          "This is another interesting street to visit in Chengdu. It is close to Kuanzhai ancient street so I'd recommend doing both of those in one go as they are also quite similar in style. This whole area is a bit commercial nevertheless the street is worth visiting.",
          "This place is nice for a stroll. It is a bit of a tourist trap so only go in the restaurants here if you feel fine about paying a bit of a tourist premium. The street looks interesting though and is certainly worth walking through.",
          "lots of people here. you can find a lot of local touristy staff. If you do not have a lot of time in Chengdu, this is one place where you can get to see/buy most of local souvenirs and taste some local food",
          "Try hot pot, must try even if you're unsure, should be the culinary experience of your stay in Chengdu. It can be stressful four newbies, but ask for meats and greens that doesn't get old fast. The rest are kind of meh... There's a panda post office that is fun! Remember to",
          "As previous reviewers have mentioned this is a great place to see the architecture and way of life of the Qing Dynasty, the only drawback is because it is so interesting it gets unbearably overcrowded (I did go on a Saturday) only reason I didn't put 5 stars.",
          "Kuanzhai alleys seem to take me back in time to the Qing dynasty period, but have been tastefully done up to attract today's crowds. Apart from the many shops, restaurants and cafes, this is a very picturesque place. It does get crowded on weekends and holidays so do try to",
          "Variously shops and restaurants, suitable for age of ppl. Nice food but bit dear compare with other local restaurants. Nice to see the traditional buildings.",
          "Too crowded. Went on a public holiday and the streets were literally packed like sardines, was challenging to manoeuvre your way into shops or take photos etc. However, the streets provides nice cultural insights to the history of Chengdu and there are many street side stalls",
          "A great place to explore and get lost in. It has a variety of shops ranging from local clothing to high end stores. I stopped in a tea house for a couple of hours to hang out and get some wifi. People in Chengdu, love to hang out this way, not too shabby!",

          "Not really sure how old or authentic this bridge is, but it's a nice spot to cross the river and once it's lit at night, it makes a stunning photo op. The bridge itself looks fairly newish and the restaurant that now spans the top is most definitely a new addition. Once you've",

          "A beautiful place, you must have your photo taken here. Bars on both sides of the bridge. Careful crossing the street from Lan Kwai Fong to the observation point, the cars are more reckless than usual here.",
          "The bridge is a famous landmark in Chengdu. On one side are fancy hotels and shops (Shangri La), and on the other side are bars and restaurants where some cater to Western tastes. In the middle is a beautiful restaurant that is very high class. If you choose to dine here,",

Built in 1911 as Shaocheng Park (\u5c11\u57ce\u516c\u56ed), it is the first public park in the city. The Railway Protection Movement Monument in the park is designated a Major Historical and Cultural Site of China.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nPeople's Park is located on Shaocheng Road in central Chengdu, near Tianfu Square. Covering an area of 112,639 square metres (1,212,440 sq ft), it is the largest green area in downtown Chengdu. The park features an artificial lake, several gardens, the Railway Protection Movement Monument, and the century-old Heming Teahouse (\u9e64\u9e23\u8336\u9986), a local landmark.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park is located in the former Shaocheng (\"small city\"), which was built by the Qing dynasty as the garrison for the Manchu and Mongol soldiers from the Eight Banners. In 1911, Yu Kun (\u7389\u6606), the last Qing general in Chengdu, converted part of Shaocheng into the city's first public park, known as Shaocheng Park.In 1911, the Railway Protection Movement erupted in Sichuan, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and replaced it with the Republic of China. From 1913\u201314, the new republican government built the Monument to the Martyrs of the Railway Protection Movement (\u8f9b\u4ea5\u79cb\u4fdd\u8def\u6b7b\u4e8b\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891) in the park, which is now a Major Historical and Cultural Site of China.The park was enlarged in 1914. In 1924, Governor Yang Sen appointed prominent businessman Lu Zuofu (\u5362\u4f5c\u5b5a) to be the education minister of Sichuan. Lu made many improvements to the park, building museums, a library, a zoo, and sports facilities.During the Second Sino-Japanese War, a bronze statue of General Wang Mingzhang of the Sichuan Army was erected in the park, after Wang was killed in the Battle of Xuzhou. On 27 September 1940 and 27 July 1941, Shaocheng Park was twice bombed by Japanese warplanes, which destroyed many facilities and caused thousands of casualties, although the Railway Protection Monument survived.After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the new Communist government renamed the park as People's Park in 1950. The park was enlarged, refurbished, and reopened in October 1952, but the Wang Mingzhang statue was demolished.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe park has its own station, People's Park Station, on Line 2 of the Chengdu Metro. It is also served by bus lines 5, 13, and 37.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Baoguang Temple (Chinese: \u5b9d\u5149\u5bfa; pinyin: B\u01ceog\u016bang S\u00ec) is located in Xindu district 18 km north of Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. It was founded during the Tang Dynasty.\nThe temple is listed as an architecture of national heritage and major conservation. It is situated on a land of 100,000 square meters. There are more than 400 large stone pillars. The temple houses important cultural treasures, including: \n\na Tang Dynasty sharira stupa with a tilt;\na Liang Dynasty (502-587) jade Buddha and stone sharira stupa;\na Shu-Han ritual bronze ding vessel from the Zhangwu era (220s);\na Tang Dynasty ceramic stupa;\na copy of the Flower Adornment Sutra (Avatamsaka Sutra) dated back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), with gold and silver pigments.\n\n\n== Temple ==\nThe temple was first built during the Tang Dynasty. It was burnt down during the Ming Dynasty; and rebuilt after the Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722) reign in Qing Dynasty. On Aug 16, 1956, the temple was listed as one of the first group of Sichuan Historical and Revolution Culture Heritage Conservation unit. On July 7, 1980, it was re-listed as one of Sichuan\u2019s Cultural Heritage Conservation Unit. On June 25, 2001, it was listed as a major National Cultural Heritage Conservation Unit.\nThe temples has a number of halls, including the Qing-era Arhat Hall (\u7f57\u6c49\u5802), containing 500 two-meter-high clay figurines of arhats. The temple also houses numerous treasures, including white jade Buddha from Burma and a stone tablet engraved with 1000 Buddhist figures.\n\n\n== Pagoda ==\nThe Sharira Stupa (\u820d\u5229\u5854), the temple's pagoda, is the only part of the temple that still dates from the Tang dynasty.  It was built between 862-888. It is square, has thirteen floors, and is 30 meters tall. The inside of the pagoda is solid, so one cannot go inside. The first floor of the pagoda is quite tall compared to the upper floors. The upper floors all feature upturned eaves, with copper bells hanging from them. The top of the pagoda is gold-plated, and each of the four sides of every floor has an image of the Buddha inlaid in gold.Shortly after the pagoda\u2019s construction in the Tang Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda partially collapsed. During the Ming Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda was restored, but the seventh floor and those above were built tilted slightly towards the west, not according to the pagodas original proportions. As a result, the pagoda has a noticeable tilt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of leaning towers#China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHarper, Damian ed. China.

At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area.

          "Very nice traditional Chinese temple. Slightly pricey at 60 RMB but still a nice place to go for a walk.",
          "Chinese temple park. I think it could be nice, but not when there are a million Chinese tourist around. On a side note: around the corner 1 well stocked, Western quality and prices outdoor shop. Almost next to it: the biggest panda-souvenir shop we saw.",
          "Wuhou is a honorable name of the former prime minister of a Chinese kingdom called Shu Han. There is a novel called 'Three Kingdoms Romance', which is a novel that dramatized the history of Shu Han period. Many Chinese people have read that novel and that novel is really popular",

          "I hope the entry fee goes to a good cause cos it's expensive. Elaborate temple which lacks atmosphere because it's very crowded. Hard to know how any locals could have a religeous experience in that throng.There is a museum but the English translations are hard to follow and",
          "This temple has history more than 1,500 years old. There are some statues depicting Chinese historical heroes. But I enjoyed not only it, and also shopping street near here.",
          "I went to this memorial today and absolutely loved it. Very calm and relaxed atmosphere and so much to look at. Well worth the 60RMB.",
          "Adjacent to the lovely Culture Park, this is actually several temples within an extensive complex. Each one is beautiful and inspiring, and the natural surroundings add to the reverence of the experience. There is an admission fee (normally 60 yuan) but I managed to get a 50%",
          "Fans and readers of the phenomenal novel (and movies and games etc), this is a must visit place. A huge complex of all kinds of relics and temples of Lord Liu Bei, Chang Fei and General Guan Yu and the legendary Advisor Zhuge Liang (Kong Ming). Walk around the mausoleum of Lord",

          "We hired a tour guide since we had many people and that was more economical. But you could also purchase the self guided audio tour sets at the entrance.",
          "If you are a big follower of either or both the story version and the history of Kingdom of Shu in the Three Kingdoms, this is the place that you must visit. The Shrine is located at the center in the city of ChengDu, so do expect to meet a large crowd there but since it is not",
          "The sensor-based audio recording was very useful for touring the place to know about the various statues.",
          "Great place to sit and watch the world go by. Beautiful area close to the water. Peaceful and quiet on the day we visited. Lots of history on display. The museum had very interesting items on display, but the all the glass protecting the artifacts needs to be cleaned. Glass",

          "Went there in holiday. I loved this place, this place is about the history of Sichuan, is about the culture of Sichuan. I grew up in Sichuan, but didn't go there before. I would like to say it's worth to be visited if you will travel Chengdu!",
          "Very nice temple with traditional architecture, surrounding by gorgeous gardens, and amazing bonsai collections, and some historic art pieces. It took us a while to find the entrance. It's actually location inside a park, right next to Jinli Street. I love how the temple has",
          "A visit here should be linked to a visit to Jinli Street as they are adjacent. The Temple is worth a visit and does show some interesting features and there are good multi lingual explanations on many exhibits. It is a also a little bit of green in the urban jungle that is",

          "Having been to many temples in china, I was going to skip this one. I'm glad I didn't. The temple itself is much the same, but the surrounding garden is worth the trip. The garden is really perfect. The flowers were out while I was there and the whole thing typified Chinese",
          "While this Temple may seem small at first, you keep walking and realize there is much more to it. It was very pretty inside and worth the walk around before checking out Jinli St.",
          "The Wuhou shrine is probably one of the most peaceful temples in China, despite being at the centre of a major city. The Qing era statues are a nice momento to an interesting period in Chinese history. The gardens are a serene place, perfect to go clear your head and walk",
          "We reached this temple by accident as we knew nothing of it, but we were glad we stumbled upon it, eventually. The temple was beautiful and serene (which was so contrasted by the nearby chaotic streets of Chengdu). We participated in a small ceremony that was there, which was",
          "As most temples and memorial sites in China they are very well kept and respected place. After you pay to get in then you enter a very large square where you can go in different directions and see burial sites, sacred Stones and much more. This is alleged to be the final resting",
          "Beautiful surroundings for a walk and take in the lovely buildings. Craziness all around so it's quite special. Lots of history, culture and time to reflect.",
          "Wuhou, or Geliang Zhu was one of the most famous people in Chinese history. He was considered as most intelligent people in Chinese history. He had a lot of legend stories. Actually it is a temple for the empire as well. Why both Geliang Zhu and the empire shared one temple?",
          "We visited around 1pm and found that it was fairly quiet. There are lots of places to sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. The bonsai garden was the highlight for us, although we did enjoy seeing all the temples and statues. Entrance cost \u00a560pp which we thought was a little",
          "Personally felt not much is to expect for this historic site as its a memorial temple however it will be much meaningful for those who wants to know more over the history. Its a small garden with a few statues and write ups in the temple. At the same time you can visit the Jin",
          "Wow. Pleasantly surprised. Living in a city without much personal space or greenery, I came here with friends reluctant to be too optimistic to avoid being let down. Frankly, from the 100 yards of leaving the taxi and walking into the temple, it was like entering a different",
          "Lots of statues of the heroes in the Three Kingdoms period with simple descriptions of them. There is a small gallery/museum showcasing some chinese historical exhibits. Tickets are a bit pricey for such a small area (RMB 60).",
          "Quite interesting, worth a quick visit but we much preferred the Wenshou Temple and surrounding area which is much less crowded and touristy. If you walk all the way through it you will come out into the very touristy Jinli Street Pedestrian area. The more interesting (to us)",
          "Interesting to look round the temple complex. We used an audio guide to get the history which I would recommend.",
          "Get away from city hustle inside temple grounds. Interesting history and fascinating bonsai collection.",
          "if you have seen one solid Chinese temple, then you can skip this one. It's more of the same thing and without an in depth understanding of chinese history, it's hard to appreciate this one any more than others.",
          "For a foreigner not more than a well kept park with some stone tablets, archways and exhibition pavilions. Nothing exciting if one does not know the history of the three kingdoms, Warring States. Steep entrance fee, crowded. Popular attraction, though most Chinese just have",
          "We found this a most interesting place and were grateful for the explanations in English on some of the boards. We came away resolved to learn more about Chinese history.",
          "I visit this temple every time I visit Chengdu. It's crowded these days but getting away from the crowds can be easy. If you're a fan of the Shu Han kingdom of the 3 kingdoms era, then this place is a must see. It's devoted to Zhuge Liang, or Minister Wu as he's known here, and",
          "There is almost no information on all of the statues. And my knowledge of Chinese history is definitely lacking so all of that was definitely lost on me. Didnt want to spend more money on top of the 60Y entry fee so I didn't spring for the audio recording but in hindsight I",
          "The architecture is beautiful and the exhibits are a bit overwhelming. To fully appreciate, you will need to know the history of Chengdu and the historical context of the various heroes depicted in this attraction. It is difficult to just walk through and just read the",

          "It is a popular city attraction. There were crowds on a Monday morning but the gardens are extensive enough to disperse everybody. To be honest, the landscaped gardens are the best part. They fill in nicely between the halls, corridors and ponds. The historic curative factor",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Its free and beautiful place to walk around. It takes less than hour to see everything.",
          "The temple is just one of many located in Nanjao Park, to the south west of the maiin city centre. It's a pricey entry fee (60CNY) for really very little, but I found arriving around 5-5:30PM made the heat less intense and the atmosphere cooler too. There's a lot to see,not just",
          "Out of all the temples and memorials i visited in Chengdu this was the one that was always at the top of the lists so had great expectations. Ticket very expensive for what it is. Got inside and straight away was disappointed but i kept my head up saying it can only get better",
          "Quiet place with a very well laid out garden. Water streams and well laid out trees that are fully grown. The best part is the bonsai garden and you can see excellent bonsais.",
          "There is quite a bit of walking around here and the heat really put me off. I couldn't enjoy it as much. Also I didn't understand much because I'm not educated much on the whole Chinese history. It's best to get the audio tour so it can tell you everything you need to know.",
          "We loved walking around this place. So much beautiful greenery, and buildings. Pools with huge firings, turtles and fish.",
          "I'd suggest having lunch or breakfast and having a stroll around before it gets too crowded, it's very well maintained and beautiful. Some of the areas are under maintenance so I'm sure it will only get more impressive.",
          "Too understand what you're visiting, get yourself at least the audio tour. Chinese experience their history way different than Europeans do, so to understand why all these emperors and warriors are so important you need subtitles. The garden is great to rest and to calm down.",
          "This temple collectively celebrates warriors of the Three Kingdoms period. There are big, strange sculptures to view, and drum and bell towers, ancient stelae, a wonderful tea garden (I watched old folks play cards for a long time) and is worth visiting if you have any sense of",

          "A nice traditional temple where you can learn about Chinese history (The Three Kingdoms), snap some photos but not so touristy. Worth a visit when one is in Chengdu.",
          "It should be a place that not to miss when you're in Changdu, especially for those who interested in the SanGuo history and the famous novel SanGuoYanYi. And there are some Chinese poetry and calligraphy also worth to see.",
          "The temple is worth a visit. I spent a couple of hours here and combined it with seeing Jinli Street which is right next to it. I would also suggest coming here from Du Fu Cottage. There is a free shuttle bus from Du Fu cottage to Wuhou Temple.",
          "Not sure why the entrance fee is quite steep. The temple has some interesting features but not comparable to what you will see in Leshan temples. It is next to Jinli pedestrian streetwhich is good for shopping and trying out loca. snacks. This can be reached by Bus 1.",
          "Historical sites for those who interested in 3 kingdoms. A bit crowded during weekend, but still nice though. Love the bonsais in the park so many anf beautiful parks, anyway if feeling thirsty or wish to try local delight jinli pedestrian walk is just next to it, so",
          "There are some incredible pieces of art! The size and scale of these artifacts are stand alone amazing but add in the age and manner in which these tablets were carved, the statues were made me feel an overwhelming connection to my heritage. So proud",
          "This temple is situated in the middle of old colonial Ghengdu. It is a rare antique building in the middle of this very modern city and attracts many visitors. I liked the Bonsai garden.",
          "Yes there are signs in English but it is best to get an audio tour guide or read up on the \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49 Three Kingdoms first to familiarize with the main protagonists. Sichuan province now sits on what was \u5c5e Shu kingdom during this period (roughly 220 AD-600 I think) Beautiful PeiJing",
          "You are there with the mausoleum of Liu Bei, the temples to Zhuge Liang (Kong Ming) and Guandi, but if these names mean nothing to you, there's really no reason to go see this complex, though it is one of the most popular sights in Chengdu for Chinese tourists and locals alike -",

          "Located in busy touristy area of Chengdu, facility didn't seem to be unkept. Pond water for goldfish was all stale and different parts of garden had swarms of moths. Garden wasn't particularly well designed and didn't compare well to ones in HangZhou for example. The figures",
          "Very serene place - much larger than expected and very interesting history. Would recommend others go.",
          "Best to visit late afternoon around 4.30pm so that thd manning crowd is not there. You will enjoy the cool and silent to admire and read the history. There is also the mausoleum of the warriors plus the beautiful garden and flowers. After the walk do walk the the Jilin Street",

          "We entered this temple spontaneously because we were trying to find food and we found out that there was a little food venue inside. When we entered we thought it would be just a normal temple. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful temples in China I have seen. It might",
          "The Wuhou Shrine is an interesting diversion in Chengdu. It is hard to believe that serene places like this exist inside city limits. The grounds are quite large and it is easy to lose yourself within the confines of the Temple. (We tried to follow the exit signs several times,",

          "It was very pretty when I was there and the Ginkgo trees were a bright yellow. Go if you have a guide that can explain the stories to you, otherwise it might be kind of boring. It is right next to Jinli street.",
          "The bonsai garden was a nice, peaceful place to sit and avoid the throngs of tourists. Other than that, it doesn't really stand out amidst the many temples you can visit in China.",
          "Beautiful grounds - especially the Gingko Biloba trees, and the tall stands of bamboo. Great displays of bonsai. Quaint temples and other structures scattered throughout the grounds.",

          "Stumbled upon this looking for Jinli street (Jinli borders the temple). Very cool statues, Architecture, landscape, and some of the best English translations we've encountered on the trip so far. Nice quiet place in a loud bustling city.",
          "This is a good way to spend a few hours in Chengdu. easy to find with the numerous taxis. I knew nothing of the three kingdoms, you do not need to to enjoy this site, There is a wonderful \"bonsai\" garden inside and the crowds are very manageable. If you like to take photos there",
          "It's mostly suited for those familiar with the Three Kingdom Saga but overall it's a very beautiful and well kept place. I loved the long red wall surrounding Liu Bei's tomb and the site itself is quite large so although it can be crowded, you'd be able to find a place to sit",

          "This area is absolutely my favorite thing I have done in Chengdu. Just when I think I have seen everything, there is another area to discover. There are some spots that are so quiet, I thought I was far out of the city. Probably 5 minutes went by looking at beautiful plants",
          "This temple is very popular to both tourists and locals. It's huge and crowded. Worth visiting to get the cultural and historical experience. 60RMB for temple ticket. If you buy ticket for the Du Fu Cottage here, get free shuttle bus to the cottage. Conveniently located next to",
          "As a huge fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in particular a supporter of Shu kingdom, I really really love this place as it is dedicated to the leader Liu Bei, and his advisor Zhuge Liang. Located quite in the city center, just right next to Jinli street, it offers quite",
          "I used the English audio guide and the voice was very easy to understand. It clearly was a native English speaking person reading a script. Overall quite nice. The layout of the area makes it a bit difficult to make sure you make it to all the buildings. If you want to see",
          "Not my favorite. Extremely touristy, from all the crap for sell to all the tour buses. And the grounds felt uncared for. We spent about ten minutes here before escaping back to all the Tibetan restaurants and stores surrounding it. All in all, an overcrowded stressful day.",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong.

The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda.

Shuangliu Airport is one of the two core hubs for Air China, together with Beijing, as well as the main hub and headquarters for Sichuan Airlines. Chengdu Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Lucky Air and Tibet Airlines also have bases at Shuangliu Airport.\nChengdu airport is also a 144-hour visa-free transit airport for foreigners from many countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar).\nThe airport has two runways and is capable of landing the Airbus A-380, currently the largest passenger aircraft in operation.

The Chengdu Railway Bureau manages the railway system of Sichuan Province, Chongqing City, Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province. Chengdu has four main freight railway stations. Among them, the Chengdu North Marshalling Station is one of the largest marshalling stations in Asia. Since April 2013, companies are able to ship goods three times a week (initially only once a week) to Europe on trains originating from Chengdu Qingbaijiang Station bound for \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. It is the first express cargo train linking China and Europe, taking 12 days to complete the full journey.\nThere are three major passenger stations servicing Chengdu: Chengdu Railway Station (commonly referred to as the \"North Station\"), Chengdu South Railway Station (ChengduNan) and Chengdu East Railway Station (ChengduDong). In addition, Chengdu West Railway Station is scheduled to open by 2030.Chengdu is the terminus of the Baoji-Chengdu railway, the Chengdu-Chongqing railway, the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Chengdu-Dazhou railway, the Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Lanzhou railway, the Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway, and the Chengdu-Dujiangyan high-speed railway.\nThe Chengdu\u2013Dujiangyan high-speed railway is a high-speed rail line connecting Chengdu with the satellite city of Dujiangyan and the Mountain Qingcheng World Heritage Site. The line is 65 km (40 mi) in length with 15 stations. CRH1 train sets on the line reach a maximum speed of 220 km/h (140 mph) and complete the full trip in 30 minutes.

There will also be a road that connects Longquan Town to Longquan Lake; it is connected to the Chengdu\u2013Jianyang Expressway and hence shorten the journey by 10 km (6.2 mi). By the end of 2008, there are ten expressways, connecting the centre of Chengdu to its suburbs. The expressways are Chenglin Expressway, extensions of Guanghua Avenue, Shawan Line, and an expressway from Chengdu to Heilongtan.\nThe toll-free Chengjin Expressway in the east of Chengdu is 38.7 km (24.0 mi) long. After it opens to the public, it will take only about half an hour to drive from central Chengdu to Jintang, half the time of the current journey.\nThe expressway between Chengdu to Heilongtan (Chengdu section), going to the south of the city, is 42 km (26 mi) long. It is also toll-free and a journey from downtown Chengdu to Heilongtan will only take half an hour.\nThe extension of Guanghua Avenue, going towards the west of the city. It make the journey time from Chongzhou City to Sanhuan Road to less than half an hour.\nThe extension of Shawan Road going north is designed for travel at 60 km/h (37 mph).

However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou\u2014both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways\u2014on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.\n\n\n== Education ==\nChengdu is home to the greatest number of universities and research institutes in Southwestern China.

The Chinese government is aiming to increase that by 15 percent every year. The nation's tennis market has reached $4 billion annually, according to Tom Cannon, a professor and sports finance expert at the University of Liverpool Management School in England.\nThe women's tour upgraded the China Open in Beijing to become the only combined event with the men's tour in Asia. Played at the Beijing Olympic Tennis Center with combined prize money of $6.6 million and a main stadium that holds 10,000 spectators, the China Open is now one of the WTA's top four tournaments.

West Pearl Tower started construction in 1992 but construction was halted later in the year due to budgeting problems. Construction restarted in 1998 and was completed in 2004.  It was mainly built to help TV networks across Chengdu but since then it has expanded to include a revolving restaurant with a 360 degree view of the city, and a recreational and commercial mall for Chengdu.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"West Pearl Tower\".

          "Wuzhou temple is located in Jinli Pedestrian street. There is a 60RMB entrance fee. But it is worth the visit. The first reason is because you will find some English captions, albeit ones that described the area. They are sufficient to help you understand the area. The 2nd",
          "They have so many histories and the view was great! Easy to access the place. At entrance, they offer the buses go different places. Good",
          "It's not a temple as much as a memorial to the kings, generals, and ministers from the Three Kingdoms period which focuses on Sichuan. The main feature is a series of larger than life statues of those kings, generals, and ministers. I liked the garden but found the statues",
          "My wife is originally from Sichuan and served as my educational guide. Lots of statues of historically important people from China's past. It might be difficult to appreciate if going without a Native Chinese speaker to read the narratives though some are in English. This",

          "Not having much background in Chinese history, I know our party missed a lot here. The Three Kingdoms period was in the 3rd century AD and if you aren't familiar with that or with Chinese poets, parts of the shrine won't have much meaning to you. But the grounds are beautiful,",
          "There was another surprise for us here. The place was very beautiful but there weren\u2019t that many people here and the 60RMB price was cut in half. There must\u2019ve been some special promotion going on in Chengdu during Christmas time because many attractions were half off. I sure",

          "It's a nice and clean place with regular architecture that's found all over China. Though it's called a \"temple\" there are no \"gods\" or Buddha statue here. The statues here are of emperors and wise men. Also on display are slabs of stone with inscriptions on them... just shows",
          "I enjoyed this Tang dynasty shrine more than the Panda base, indeed it might be the best place I visited in China. The gardens are superb and very reflective of Chinese garden style, with a wonderful blend of nature and sculptures. There is the biggest Bonsai garden I have ever",
          "It is easy to walk to the Buddhist Temple from the Sunshine Hotel to observe the architecture, the monks in Buddhist attire, and the Chinese as they practice their Buddhist faith. As you walk in the community, you will also observe the life and livelihood of the Chinese people",

          "\u6b66\u4faf\u7960 was in renovation when I visited. I walked past the park and found a relaxing environment. If you have time and don't want to leave the town, it is a place worth visiting.",
          "This temple is nice to walk around. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there, but you should visit Jinli Pedestrian Street for some food and drink anyway, and one temple entrance is right on Jinli St.",
          "Very nice traditional Chinese temple. Slightly pricey at 60 RMB but still a nice place to go for a walk.",
          "Chinese temple park. I think it could be nice, but not when there are a million Chinese tourist around. On a side note: around the corner 1 well stocked, Western quality and prices outdoor shop. Almost next to it: the biggest panda-souvenir shop we saw.",
          "Wuhou is a honorable name of the former prime minister of a Chinese kingdom called Shu Han. There is a novel called 'Three Kingdoms Romance', which is a novel that dramatized the history of Shu Han period. Many Chinese people have read that novel and that novel is really popular",
          "Even though it's busy, I found it peaceful and relaxing. Lots of areas to sit and think. Nice photo opportunities. Nice architecture. I really enjoyed it. Worth checking out",
          "I hope the entry fee goes to a good cause cos it's expensive. Elaborate temple which lacks atmosphere because it's very crowded. Hard to know how any locals could have a religeous experience in that throng.There is a museum but the English translations are hard to follow and",

          "Adjacent to the lovely Culture Park, this is actually several temples within an extensive complex. Each one is beautiful and inspiring, and the natural surroundings add to the reverence of the experience. There is an admission fee (normally 60 yuan) but I managed to get a 50%",
          "Fans and readers of the phenomenal novel (and movies and games etc), this is a must visit place. A huge complex of all kinds of relics and temples of Lord Liu Bei, Chang Fei and General Guan Yu and the legendary Advisor Zhuge Liang (Kong Ming). Walk around the mausoleum of Lord",

          "Good spot to get out of the traffic and have some peace and quite (if you go early!) Nice examples of Chinese gardens and architecture",
          "We hired a tour guide since we had many people and that was more economical. But you could also purchase the self guided audio tour sets at the entrance.",
          "If you are a big follower of either or both the story version and the history of Kingdom of Shu in the Three Kingdoms, this is the place that you must visit. The Shrine is located at the center in the city of ChengDu, so do expect to meet a large crowd there but since it is not",
          "The sensor-based audio recording was very useful for touring the place to know about the various statues.",
          "Great place to sit and watch the world go by. Beautiful area close to the water. Peaceful and quiet on the day we visited. Lots of history on display. The museum had very interesting items on display, but the all the glass protecting the artifacts needs to be cleaned. Glass",

          "Next to Jinli old street ,huge , always crowded ,interesting with big size statues of 3 friends almost brothers in life and death .",
          "Went there in holiday. I loved this place, this place is about the history of Sichuan, is about the culture of Sichuan. I grew up in Sichuan, but didn't go there before. I would like to say it's worth to be visited if you will travel Chengdu!",
          "Very nice temple with traditional architecture, surrounding by gorgeous gardens, and amazing bonsai collections, and some historic art pieces. It took us a while to find the entrance. It's actually location inside a park, right next to Jinli Street. I love how the temple has",
          "A visit here should be linked to a visit to Jinli Street as they are adjacent. The Temple is worth a visit and does show some interesting features and there are good multi lingual explanations on many exhibits. It is a also a little bit of green in the urban jungle that is",

          "A lovely temple next to Jinli pedestrian street. A great way to mix a historical/cultural site with a stroll down a pedestrian shopping and snacking street.",
          "Having been to many temples in china, I was going to skip this one. I'm glad I didn't. The temple itself is much the same, but the surrounding garden is worth the trip. The garden is really perfect. The flowers were out while I was there and the whole thing typified Chinese",
          "While this Temple may seem small at first, you keep walking and realize there is much more to it. It was very pretty inside and worth the walk around before checking out Jinli St.",
          "The Wuhou shrine is probably one of the most peaceful temples in China, despite being at the centre of a major city. The Qing era statues are a nice momento to an interesting period in Chinese history. The gardens are a serene place, perfect to go clear your head and walk",
          "We reached this temple by accident as we knew nothing of it, but we were glad we stumbled upon it, eventually. The temple was beautiful and serene (which was so contrasted by the nearby chaotic streets of Chengdu). We participated in a small ceremony that was there, which was",
          "As most temples and memorial sites in China they are very well kept and respected place. After you pay to get in then you enter a very large square where you can go in different directions and see burial sites, sacred Stones and much more. This is alleged to be the final resting",
          "Beautiful surroundings for a walk and take in the lovely buildings. Craziness all around so it's quite special. Lots of history, culture and time to reflect.",
          "Wuhou, or Geliang Zhu was one of the most famous people in Chinese history. He was considered as most intelligent people in Chinese history. He had a lot of legend stories. Actually it is a temple for the empire as well. Why both Geliang Zhu and the empire shared one temple?",
          "We visited around 1pm and found that it was fairly quiet. There are lots of places to sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. The bonsai garden was the highlight for us, although we did enjoy seeing all the temples and statues. Entrance cost \u00a560pp which we thought was a little",
          "Personally felt not much is to expect for this historic site as its a memorial temple however it will be much meaningful for those who wants to know more over the history. Its a small garden with a few statues and write ups in the temple. At the same time you can visit the Jin",
          "Wow. Pleasantly surprised. Living in a city without much personal space or greenery, I came here with friends reluctant to be too optimistic to avoid being let down. Frankly, from the 100 yards of leaving the taxi and walking into the temple, it was like entering a different",
          "Lots of statues of the heroes in the Three Kingdoms period with simple descriptions of them. There is a small gallery/museum showcasing some chinese historical exhibits. Tickets are a bit pricey for such a small area (RMB 60).",
          "Quite interesting, worth a quick visit but we much preferred the Wenshou Temple and surrounding area which is much less crowded and touristy. If you walk all the way through it you will come out into the very touristy Jinli Street Pedestrian area. The more interesting (to us)",
          "Interesting to look round the temple complex. We used an audio guide to get the history which I would recommend.",
          "Get away from city hustle inside temple grounds. Interesting history and fascinating bonsai collection.",
          "if you have seen one solid Chinese temple, then you can skip this one. It's more of the same thing and without an in depth understanding of chinese history, it's hard to appreciate this one any more than others.",
          "For a foreigner not more than a well kept park with some stone tablets, archways and exhibition pavilions. Nothing exciting if one does not know the history of the three kingdoms, Warring States. Steep entrance fee, crowded. Popular attraction, though most Chinese just have",
          "We found this a most interesting place and were grateful for the explanations in English on some of the boards. We came away resolved to learn more about Chinese history.",
          "I visit this temple every time I visit Chengdu. It's crowded these days but getting away from the crowds can be easy. If you're a fan of the Shu Han kingdom of the 3 kingdoms era, then this place is a must see. It's devoted to Zhuge Liang, or Minister Wu as he's known here, and",
          "There is almost no information on all of the statues. And my knowledge of Chinese history is definitely lacking so all of that was definitely lost on me. Didnt want to spend more money on top of the 60Y entry fee so I didn't spring for the audio recording but in hindsight I",
          "The architecture is beautiful and the exhibits are a bit overwhelming. To fully appreciate, you will need to know the history of Chengdu and the historical context of the various heroes depicted in this attraction. It is difficult to just walk through and just read the",
          "The Marquis of Wu 181 - 234 a military genius who joined the Three Kingdoms. The area is surrounded by gardens and another area dedicated to Emperor Liu Bei.",
          "It is a popular city attraction. There were crowds on a Monday morning but the gardens are extensive enough to disperse everybody. To be honest, the landscaped gardens are the best part. They fill in nicely between the halls, corridors and ponds. The historic curative factor",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Its free and beautiful place to walk around. It takes less than hour to see everything.",
          "The temple is just one of many located in Nanjao Park, to the south west of the maiin city centre. It's a pricey entry fee (60CNY) for really very little, but I found arriving around 5-5:30PM made the heat less intense and the atmosphere cooler too. There's a lot to see,not just",
          "Out of all the temples and memorials i visited in Chengdu this was the one that was always at the top of the lists so had great expectations. Ticket very expensive for what it is. Got inside and straight away was disappointed but i kept my head up saying it can only get better",
          "Quiet place with a very well laid out garden. Water streams and well laid out trees that are fully grown. The best part is the bonsai garden and you can see excellent bonsais.",
          "There is quite a bit of walking around here and the heat really put me off. I couldn't enjoy it as much. Also I didn't understand much because I'm not educated much on the whole Chinese history. It's best to get the audio tour so it can tell you everything you need to know.",
          "We loved walking around this place. So much beautiful greenery, and buildings. Pools with huge firings, turtles and fish.",
          "I'd suggest having lunch or breakfast and having a stroll around before it gets too crowded, it's very well maintained and beautiful. Some of the areas are under maintenance so I'm sure it will only get more impressive.",
          "Too understand what you're visiting, get yourself at least the audio tour. Chinese experience their history way different than Europeans do, so to understand why all these emperors and warriors are so important you need subtitles. The garden is great to rest and to calm down.",
          "This temple collectively celebrates warriors of the Three Kingdoms period. There are big, strange sculptures to view, and drum and bell towers, ancient stelae, a wonderful tea garden (I watched old folks play cards for a long time) and is worth visiting if you have any sense of",

          "A nice traditional temple where you can learn about Chinese history (The Three Kingdoms), snap some photos but not so touristy. Worth a visit when one is in Chengdu.",
          "It should be a place that not to miss when you're in Changdu, especially for those who interested in the SanGuo history and the famous novel SanGuoYanYi. And there are some Chinese poetry and calligraphy also worth to see.",
          "The temple is worth a visit. I spent a couple of hours here and combined it with seeing Jinli Street which is right next to it. I would also suggest coming here from Du Fu Cottage. There is a free shuttle bus from Du Fu cottage to Wuhou Temple.",
          "Not sure why the entrance fee is quite steep. The temple has some interesting features but not comparable to what you will see in Leshan temples. It is next to Jinli pedestrian streetwhich is good for shopping and trying out loca. snacks. This can be reached by Bus 1.",
          "Historical sites for those who interested in 3 kingdoms. A bit crowded during weekend, but still nice though. Love the bonsais in the park so many anf beautiful parks, anyway if feeling thirsty or wish to try local delight jinli pedestrian walk is just next to it, so",
          "There are some incredible pieces of art! The size and scale of these artifacts are stand alone amazing but add in the age and manner in which these tablets were carved, the statues were made me feel an overwhelming connection to my heritage. So proud",
          "This temple is situated in the middle of old colonial Ghengdu. It is a rare antique building in the middle of this very modern city and attracts many visitors. I liked the Bonsai garden.",
          "Yes there are signs in English but it is best to get an audio tour guide or read up on the \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49 Three Kingdoms first to familiarize with the main protagonists. Sichuan province now sits on what was \u5c5e Shu kingdom during this period (roughly 220 AD-600 I think) Beautiful PeiJing",
          "You are there with the mausoleum of Liu Bei, the temples to Zhuge Liang (Kong Ming) and Guandi, but if these names mean nothing to you, there's really no reason to go see this complex, though it is one of the most popular sights in Chengdu for Chinese tourists and locals alike -",
          "An interesting place to visit while you are in Chengdu. The colourful statues in the temple are amazing, and the grounds are nice.",
          "Located in busy touristy area of Chengdu, facility didn't seem to be unkept. Pond water for goldfish was all stale and different parts of garden had swarms of moths. Garden wasn't particularly well designed and didn't compare well to ones in HangZhou for example. The figures",
          "Very serene place - much larger than expected and very interesting history. Would recommend others go.",
          "Best to visit late afternoon around 4.30pm so that thd manning crowd is not there. You will enjoy the cool and silent to admire and read the history. There is also the mausoleum of the warriors plus the beautiful garden and flowers. After the walk do walk the the Jilin Street",

          "We entered this temple spontaneously because we were trying to find food and we found out that there was a little food venue inside. When we entered we thought it would be just a normal temple. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful temples in China I have seen. It might",
          "The Wuhou Shrine is an interesting diversion in Chengdu. It is hard to believe that serene places like this exist inside city limits. The grounds are quite large and it is easy to lose yourself within the confines of the Temple. (We tried to follow the exit signs several times,",
          "I learned a lot of history that I hadn't heard before whilst visiting this temples. Some very interesting characters in Chinese history. Beautiful place and great to go just before Chinese New Year with all the decorations.",

          "Is it a beautiful garden, with a bonsai exposition, a historic museum or a temple? I wasn't able to figure it out. Nevertheless it was worth the trip and the entrance fee (60 yuan for an adult, 30 for kids from 12 to 18). A walk down the place will take an hour or a but more. Go",

        "wiki": "The Yongling Mausoleum (Chinese: \u6c38\u9675; pinyin: Y\u01d2ngl\u00edng), commonly known as the tomb of Wang Jian (Chinese: \u738b\u5efa\u5893), is the burial place of Wang Jian (847\u2013918), the founding emperor of Former Shu. It is located at 10 Yongling Road, Jinniu District, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.\nIn the Later Tang dynasty (923\u2013937), Emperor Meng Zhixiang issued a decree to protect the tomb. However, the auxiliary buildings of the site decayed from the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) on. Only the grave mound and the coffin chamber survive. It was excavated between 1940 and 1943 by the archaeologist Feng Hanji and others and confirmed as Wang Jian's tomb. A number of cultural relics were found, which were transferred to Sichuan Museum. It has twice been listed as a cultural relics protection site in Sichuan Province. In 2001 a tomb passage was rebuilt in the style of other Tang dynasty imperial mausoleums.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Yongling Mausoleum is located at 10 Yongling Road, Jinniu District, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. To date, it is the only ancient Chinese royal tomb found with the coffin chamber above ground. The grave mound is circular, and the coffin chamber is located underneath the middle of the mound. The chamber has three rooms, with a coffin in the middle room and a stone statue of Wang Jian in a sitting position in the room behind. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nWang Jian (847 \u2013 July 11, 918), formally Emperor Gaozu, was the founding emperor of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Former Shu. He died in the first year of the Tianguang period (918 CE) at the age of 72, with a temple name of Gaozu and was buried in Chengdu. In December 918 and again in March 925 (the first year of the Xiankang period), Wang Yan, Wang Jian's successor, visited the tomb to show his respect.:6079,6081 In 933 (the fourth year of the Changxing era of the Later Tang dynasty), Meng Zhixiang had the tomb renovated and formally prohibited the cutting of firewood in the nearby area.:6091 In 1014 (the 7th year of the Dazhongxiangfu era of the Northern Song dynasty), several of the mausoleum buildings were demolished, and the material used to repair a local Taoist temple named Yuejuhua.:9-10 The remaining buildings were served as a Buddhist temple named Yongning, renamed Yongqingyuan in 1103 (the second year of the Chongning period of the Northern Song Dynasty). The whole structure was later destroyed by fire,:775 with only the grave mound surviving.The location of the tomb was not recorded accurately in historical records. The most widespread description of its location was in a poem by Lu You, which described the tomb of Wang Jian along with that of his empress as being located immediately outside the \"Old West Gate\". The poem described the grave as having already been heavily damaged, stating that only two stone columns, carved with scriptures, and several huge human and horse statues still stood. Since then, records of the tomb in local chronicles followed Lu You's description.:1\n\n\n== Excavation ==\nIn 1940, brick walls of the grave were discovered during the construction of a bomb shelter. The discovery drew the attention of Feng Hanji, an archaeology professor at Huaxi University. After an investigation, Feng identified the mound as an ancient tomb. Due to conditions at the time, the exposed parts of the site had to be temporarily closed, and an excavation plan was not developed until the establishment of the Sichuan Museum in 1941. On September 15, 1942, the excavation of the tomb began, led by Feng Hanji and Liu Fuzhang. The tomb was filled with silt, and archaeologists were only able to clear a 3-meter path to the chambers. During the excavation, several items made of jade were unearthed and it was determined that the tomb was the Mausoleum of Wang Jian.\nThe site of the tomb is close to the location given in Lu You's poem,:1-4 but the archaeologists did not find the huge stone human statue it described. The sinologist, Michael Sullivan joined the excavation; he was mistaken by a middle school student for a foreign grave robber, reported to government officials, and detained along with other archaeologists. The excavation work was interrupted by this misunderstanding. In November 1942, the excavation work was temporarily suspended. On March 1, 1943, the archaeologist Wu Jinding and Wang Zhenduo, an expert in museology, launched the second stage of the excavation. This stage focused on the southern part of the grave mound and the main chamber. The excavation discovered traces of grave robbing and unearthed a large number of cultural relics. On September 21, all excavation work was completed. The cultural relics were transferred to Sichuan Museum,:1-4 and the mound was closed again. In 1971, when building a house 300 metres (980 ft) to the south of the tomb, a member of the Fuqin production brigade of Chengdu Jinniu District found a stone statue 3.18 metres (10.4 ft) high, confirming the Lu You's description.\n\n\n== Recent developments ==\nThe tomb of Wang Jian has twice been listed as a cultural relics protection site in Sichuan Province: in 1956 and 1980. In 1961, it was listed as a national key cultural relics protection site. In 2001 a tomb passage was rebuilt on the south side of the Wang Jian Tomb, using materials and techniques found in other Tang dynasty imperial mausoleums; and several stone statues were added by the Yongling Museum.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe grave is widely believed to be the location of the legendary meeting between Sima Xiangru and Zhuge Liang, two famous military strategists during the Three Kingdoms period. According to the folk legend, they played the qin, a traditional Chinese musical instrument, on the grave mound during their meeting. This caused the grave mound to be named Fuqintai, meaning the place where qin are played.\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom.

          "There was another surprise for us here. The place was very beautiful but there weren\u2019t that many people here and the 60RMB price was cut in half. There must\u2019ve been some special promotion going on in Chengdu during Christmas time because many attractions were half off. I sure",
          "Must visit destination in Chengdu, we got in at a 50% discount for the month of December, a bargain, great grounds and a thorough history lesson of China over 2000 years ago.",
          "The temple is a memorial to Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang and others who played an important role during the Three Kingdoms period. Apart from the temple, there is also a park, and one can visit the tomb where Liu Bei is buried with his 2 wives. One needs to buy admission tickets for",

          "We went with no expectation but were impressed by the picturesque late autumn garden! The main statue of this memorial temple is Zhuge Liang, whom was the smart premier to Liu Bei, the leader of Shu Kingdom (now Sichuan province) during the Three Kingdoms era in the Chinese",
          "My overall rating is three stars: Fairly interesting, you won't regret going. This well-marked attraction is a cluster of traditional-style buildings with generously-spaced courtyards separating them. Comes with a so-so garden and a burial mound. Unless you\u2019re familiar with the",
          "As interesting as other temples, with gorgeous gardens and exquisite bonsai trees. Somewhat overpriced but pleasant to break up city stress.",
          "This is again a very interesting place, with large natural gardens and typical architecture. More of a memorial than a temple. Larger than life statues of the monarchs and generals.",
          "Such a beautiful set of buildings with a wide range of things to see. This was a stunning example of ancient Chinese culture at its best and with information in English which was very helpful.",
          "This place is bigger and richer than I expected. There are many historical objects to see and many interesting corners to wonder into. We also enjoyed the gardens, the alley with pink walls and bamboo plants. The exit of this place will lead you right into Jingli which is one",
          "Nice park and has a lot of historical items for you to understand the ancient history of heroes during the wartime. It also locates next to a historical busy shopping street.",
          "Happened to chance on this place while visiting the Jinli pedestrian street and went in. One need to buy ticket to enter. The place is huge and maintained well, everywhere is clean including the toilets. Lotsa history there with hundreds of statues for the generals in the olden",
          "Places of historical interest like this temple are always a welcome departure from the somewhat maniacal and destructive march forward that China thrives on. So much gets torn down and replaced in this country that one cherishes the opportunity to absorb something genuinely",
          "Belongs to old Chengdu. Very nice gardens / temple. Lovely scenic and historical spot away from modern / full of traffic Chengdu. Benches to sit on. Notice to the elderly / injured : as in many Chinese old temples, structures are separated by a 20-30cm high border that you",
          "It's a nice and clean place with regular architecture that's found all over China. Though it's called a \"temple\" there are no \"gods\" or Buddha statue here. The statues here are of emperors and wise men. Also on display are slabs of stone with inscriptions on them... just shows",
          "I enjoyed this Tang dynasty shrine more than the Panda base, indeed it might be the best place I visited in China. The gardens are superb and very reflective of Chinese garden style, with a wonderful blend of nature and sculptures. There is the biggest Bonsai garden I have ever",
          "It is easy to walk to the Buddhist Temple from the Sunshine Hotel to observe the architecture, the monks in Buddhist attire, and the Chinese as they practice their Buddhist faith. As you walk in the community, you will also observe the life and livelihood of the Chinese people",
          "Beautiful temple with lovely gardens. Indeed a bit dear for a temple in Chengdu but not unreasonable.",
          "\u6b66\u4faf\u7960 was in renovation when I visited. I walked past the park and found a relaxing environment. If you have time and don't want to leave the town, it is a place worth visiting.",
          "This temple is nice to walk around. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there, but you should visit Jinli Pedestrian Street for some food and drink anyway, and one temple entrance is right on Jinli St.",
          "Very nice traditional Chinese temple. Slightly pricey at 60 RMB but still a nice place to go for a walk.",
          "Chinese temple park. I think it could be nice, but not when there are a million Chinese tourist around. On a side note: around the corner 1 well stocked, Western quality and prices outdoor shop. Almost next to it: the biggest panda-souvenir shop we saw.",
          "Wuhou is a honorable name of the former prime minister of a Chinese kingdom called Shu Han. There is a novel called 'Three Kingdoms Romance', which is a novel that dramatized the history of Shu Han period. Many Chinese people have read that novel and that novel is really popular",
          "Even though it's busy, I found it peaceful and relaxing. Lots of areas to sit and think. Nice photo opportunities. Nice architecture. I really enjoyed it. Worth checking out",
          "I hope the entry fee goes to a good cause cos it's expensive. Elaborate temple which lacks atmosphere because it's very crowded. Hard to know how any locals could have a religeous experience in that throng.There is a museum but the English translations are hard to follow and",
          "This temple has history more than 1,500 years old. There are some statues depicting Chinese historical heroes. But I enjoyed not only it, and also shopping street near here.",
          "I went to this memorial today and absolutely loved it. Very calm and relaxed atmosphere and so much to look at. Well worth the 60RMB.",
          "Adjacent to the lovely Culture Park, this is actually several temples within an extensive complex. Each one is beautiful and inspiring, and the natural surroundings add to the reverence of the experience. There is an admission fee (normally 60 yuan) but I managed to get a 50%",
          "Fans and readers of the phenomenal novel (and movies and games etc), this is a must visit place. A huge complex of all kinds of relics and temples of Lord Liu Bei, Chang Fei and General Guan Yu and the legendary Advisor Zhuge Liang (Kong Ming). Walk around the mausoleum of Lord",
          "This shrine with it's garden shows you typical bridges, bonsai, waterways and ponds with plenty of places to rest. Many opportunities to take great pictures. I was lucky and did not encounter any tour groups or heaps of people.",
          "Good spot to get out of the traffic and have some peace and quite (if you go early!) Nice examples of Chinese gardens and architecture",
          "We hired a tour guide since we had many people and that was more economical. But you could also purchase the self guided audio tour sets at the entrance.",
          "If you are a big follower of either or both the story version and the history of Kingdom of Shu in the Three Kingdoms, this is the place that you must visit. The Shrine is located at the center in the city of ChengDu, so do expect to meet a large crowd there but since it is not",
          "The sensor-based audio recording was very useful for touring the place to know about the various statues.",
          "Great place to sit and watch the world go by. Beautiful area close to the water. Peaceful and quiet on the day we visited. Lots of history on display. The museum had very interesting items on display, but the all the glass protecting the artifacts needs to be cleaned. Glass",
          "Such a beautiful place to visit...lots of history and beautiful buildings...it's busy with tourists as many places are here...",
          "Next to Jinli old street ,huge , always crowded ,interesting with big size statues of 3 friends almost brothers in life and death .",
          "Went there in holiday. I loved this place, this place is about the history of Sichuan, is about the culture of Sichuan. I grew up in Sichuan, but didn't go there before. I would like to say it's worth to be visited if you will travel Chengdu!",
          "Very nice temple with traditional architecture, surrounding by gorgeous gardens, and amazing bonsai collections, and some historic art pieces. It took us a while to find the entrance. It's actually location inside a park, right next to Jinli Street. I love how the temple has",
          "A visit here should be linked to a visit to Jinli Street as they are adjacent. The Temple is worth a visit and does show some interesting features and there are good multi lingual explanations on many exhibits. It is a also a little bit of green in the urban jungle that is",
          "For all north east Asians and video game lovers, this us the place to visit and worship. Well managed and maintained. Good location, next to the food bazaar.",
          "A lovely temple next to Jinli pedestrian street. A great way to mix a historical/cultural site with a stroll down a pedestrian shopping and snacking street.",
          "Having been to many temples in china, I was going to skip this one. I'm glad I didn't. The temple itself is much the same, but the surrounding garden is worth the trip. The garden is really perfect. The flowers were out while I was there and the whole thing typified Chinese",
          "While this Temple may seem small at first, you keep walking and realize there is much more to it. It was very pretty inside and worth the walk around before checking out Jinli St.",
          "The Wuhou shrine is probably one of the most peaceful temples in China, despite being at the centre of a major city. The Qing era statues are a nice momento to an interesting period in Chinese history. The gardens are a serene place, perfect to go clear your head and walk",
          "We reached this temple by accident as we knew nothing of it, but we were glad we stumbled upon it, eventually. The temple was beautiful and serene (which was so contrasted by the nearby chaotic streets of Chengdu). We participated in a small ceremony that was there, which was",
          "As most temples and memorial sites in China they are very well kept and respected place. After you pay to get in then you enter a very large square where you can go in different directions and see burial sites, sacred Stones and much more. This is alleged to be the final resting",
          "Beautiful surroundings for a walk and take in the lovely buildings. Craziness all around so it's quite special. Lots of history, culture and time to reflect.",
          "Wuhou, or Geliang Zhu was one of the most famous people in Chinese history. He was considered as most intelligent people in Chinese history. He had a lot of legend stories. Actually it is a temple for the empire as well. Why both Geliang Zhu and the empire shared one temple?",
          "We visited around 1pm and found that it was fairly quiet. There are lots of places to sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. The bonsai garden was the highlight for us, although we did enjoy seeing all the temples and statues. Entrance cost \u00a560pp which we thought was a little",
          "Personally felt not much is to expect for this historic site as its a memorial temple however it will be much meaningful for those who wants to know more over the history. Its a small garden with a few statues and write ups in the temple. At the same time you can visit the Jin",
          "Wow. Pleasantly surprised. Living in a city without much personal space or greenery, I came here with friends reluctant to be too optimistic to avoid being let down. Frankly, from the 100 yards of leaving the taxi and walking into the temple, it was like entering a different",
          "Lots of statues of the heroes in the Three Kingdoms period with simple descriptions of them. There is a small gallery/museum showcasing some chinese historical exhibits. Tickets are a bit pricey for such a small area (RMB 60).",
          "Quite interesting, worth a quick visit but we much preferred the Wenshou Temple and surrounding area which is much less crowded and touristy. If you walk all the way through it you will come out into the very touristy Jinli Street Pedestrian area. The more interesting (to us)",
          "Interesting to look round the temple complex. We used an audio guide to get the history which I would recommend.",
          "Get away from city hustle inside temple grounds. Interesting history and fascinating bonsai collection.",
          "if you have seen one solid Chinese temple, then you can skip this one. It's more of the same thing and without an in depth understanding of chinese history, it's hard to appreciate this one any more than others.",
          "For a foreigner not more than a well kept park with some stone tablets, archways and exhibition pavilions. Nothing exciting if one does not know the history of the three kingdoms, Warring States. Steep entrance fee, crowded. Popular attraction, though most Chinese just have",
          "We found this a most interesting place and were grateful for the explanations in English on some of the boards. We came away resolved to learn more about Chinese history.",
          "I visit this temple every time I visit Chengdu. It's crowded these days but getting away from the crowds can be easy. If you're a fan of the Shu Han kingdom of the 3 kingdoms era, then this place is a must see. It's devoted to Zhuge Liang, or Minister Wu as he's known here, and",
          "There is almost no information on all of the statues. And my knowledge of Chinese history is definitely lacking so all of that was definitely lost on me. Didnt want to spend more money on top of the 60Y entry fee so I didn't spring for the audio recording but in hindsight I",
          "The architecture is beautiful and the exhibits are a bit overwhelming. To fully appreciate, you will need to know the history of Chengdu and the historical context of the various heroes depicted in this attraction. It is difficult to just walk through and just read the",
          "The Marquis of Wu 181 - 234 a military genius who joined the Three Kingdoms. The area is surrounded by gardens and another area dedicated to Emperor Liu Bei.",
          "It is a popular city attraction. There were crowds on a Monday morning but the gardens are extensive enough to disperse everybody. To be honest, the landscaped gardens are the best part. They fill in nicely between the halls, corridors and ponds. The historic curative factor",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Its free and beautiful place to walk around. It takes less than hour to see everything.",
          "The temple is just one of many located in Nanjao Park, to the south west of the maiin city centre. It's a pricey entry fee (60CNY) for really very little, but I found arriving around 5-5:30PM made the heat less intense and the atmosphere cooler too. There's a lot to see,not just",
          "Out of all the temples and memorials i visited in Chengdu this was the one that was always at the top of the lists so had great expectations. Ticket very expensive for what it is. Got inside and straight away was disappointed but i kept my head up saying it can only get better",
          "Quiet place with a very well laid out garden. Water streams and well laid out trees that are fully grown. The best part is the bonsai garden and you can see excellent bonsais.",
          "There is quite a bit of walking around here and the heat really put me off. I couldn't enjoy it as much. Also I didn't understand much because I'm not educated much on the whole Chinese history. It's best to get the audio tour so it can tell you everything you need to know.",
          "We loved walking around this place. So much beautiful greenery, and buildings. Pools with huge firings, turtles and fish.",
          "I'd suggest having lunch or breakfast and having a stroll around before it gets too crowded, it's very well maintained and beautiful. Some of the areas are under maintenance so I'm sure it will only get more impressive.",
          "Too understand what you're visiting, get yourself at least the audio tour. Chinese experience their history way different than Europeans do, so to understand why all these emperors and warriors are so important you need subtitles. The garden is great to rest and to calm down.",
          "This temple collectively celebrates warriors of the Three Kingdoms period. There are big, strange sculptures to view, and drum and bell towers, ancient stelae, a wonderful tea garden (I watched old folks play cards for a long time) and is worth visiting if you have any sense of",

          "A nice traditional temple where you can learn about Chinese history (The Three Kingdoms), snap some photos but not so touristy. Worth a visit when one is in Chengdu.",
          "It should be a place that not to miss when you're in Changdu, especially for those who interested in the SanGuo history and the famous novel SanGuoYanYi. And there are some Chinese poetry and calligraphy also worth to see.",
          "The temple is worth a visit. I spent a couple of hours here and combined it with seeing Jinli Street which is right next to it. I would also suggest coming here from Du Fu Cottage. There is a free shuttle bus from Du Fu cottage to Wuhou Temple.",
          "Not sure why the entrance fee is quite steep. The temple has some interesting features but not comparable to what you will see in Leshan temples. It is next to Jinli pedestrian streetwhich is good for shopping and trying out loca. snacks. This can be reached by Bus 1.",
          "Historical sites for those who interested in 3 kingdoms. A bit crowded during weekend, but still nice though. Love the bonsais in the park so many anf beautiful parks, anyway if feeling thirsty or wish to try local delight jinli pedestrian walk is just next to it, so",
          "There are some incredible pieces of art! The size and scale of these artifacts are stand alone amazing but add in the age and manner in which these tablets were carved, the statues were made me feel an overwhelming connection to my heritage. So proud",
          "This temple is situated in the middle of old colonial Ghengdu. It is a rare antique building in the middle of this very modern city and attracts many visitors. I liked the Bonsai garden.",
          "Yes there are signs in English but it is best to get an audio tour guide or read up on the \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49 Three Kingdoms first to familiarize with the main protagonists. Sichuan province now sits on what was \u5c5e Shu kingdom during this period (roughly 220 AD-600 I think) Beautiful PeiJing",

          "Located in busy touristy area of Chengdu, facility didn't seem to be unkept. Pond water for goldfish was all stale and different parts of garden had swarms of moths. Garden wasn't particularly well designed and didn't compare well to ones in HangZhou for example. The figures",
          "Very serene place - much larger than expected and very interesting history. Would recommend others go.",
          "Best to visit late afternoon around 4.30pm so that thd manning crowd is not there. You will enjoy the cool and silent to admire and read the history. There is also the mausoleum of the warriors plus the beautiful garden and flowers. After the walk do walk the the Jilin Street",

          "We entered this temple spontaneously because we were trying to find food and we found out that there was a little food venue inside. When we entered we thought it would be just a normal temple. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful temples in China I have seen. It might",
          "The Wuhou Shrine is an interesting diversion in Chengdu. It is hard to believe that serene places like this exist inside city limits. The grounds are quite large and it is easy to lose yourself within the confines of the Temple. (We tried to follow the exit signs several times,",

          "Stumbled upon this looking for Jinli street (Jinli borders the temple). Very cool statues, Architecture, landscape, and some of the best English translations we've encountered on the trip so far. Nice quiet place in a loud bustling city.",
          "This is a good way to spend a few hours in Chengdu. easy to find with the numerous taxis. I knew nothing of the three kingdoms, you do not need to to enjoy this site, There is a wonderful \"bonsai\" garden inside and the crowds are very manageable. If you like to take photos there",
          "It's mostly suited for those familiar with the Three Kingdom Saga but overall it's a very beautiful and well kept place. I loved the long red wall surrounding Liu Bei's tomb and the site itself is quite large so although it can be crowded, you'd be able to find a place to sit",
          "Worth a quick stop; I believe it is near Jinli Pedestrian street as well. You can see it from the outside just fine; no need to pay the entrance fee to be honest.",

          "I used the English audio guide and the voice was very easy to understand. It clearly was a native English speaking person reading a script. Overall quite nice. The layout of the area makes it a bit difficult to make sure you make it to all the buildings. If you want to see",
          "Not my favorite. Extremely touristy, from all the crap for sell to all the tour buses. And the grounds felt uncared for. We spent about ten minutes here before escaping back to all the Tibetan restaurants and stores surrounding it. All in all, an overcrowded stressful day.",

          "This is a historical temple and our tour guide explained many of the features within the grounds. Some of the statues of the people on display are quite fearsome looking. The gardens and grounds within this area are quite peaceful after the hustle and bustle of Jinli Lu next",

          "Our guide suggested we walk through the grounds and we are so pleased that she did. The grounds are really beautiful and so well maintained. The monks live and worship at the temple. There wasn't any entry fee but you can make a donation. Very peaceful and well worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001.

However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou\u2014both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways\u2014on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development.

The English professional football club, Sheffield United F.C., took over the club on 11 December 2005. The club was later promoted into the China Super League until they were embroiled in a match-fixing scandal in 2009. Punished with relegation the owners eventually sold their majority on 9 December 2010 to Hung Fu Enterprise Co., Ltd and Scarborough Development (China) Co., Ltd.

The Chinese government is aiming to increase that by 15 percent every year. The nation's tennis market has reached $4 billion annually, according to Tom Cannon, a professor and sports finance expert at the University of Liverpool Management School in England.\nThe women's tour upgraded the China Open in Beijing to become the only combined event with the men's tour in Asia. Played at the Beijing Olympic Tennis Center with combined prize money of $6.6 million and a main stadium that holds 10,000 spectators, the China Open is now one of the WTA's top four tournaments.

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom. The head of the Shu Han State in the Three Kingdoms period was seated in Huanglongxi, and for some time, the general government offices for Renshou, Pengshan, and Huayang counties were also located here.\nThe ancient town has preserved the Qing dynasty architectural style, as seen in the design of its streets, shops, and buildings.\n\n\n==== Chunxi Road ====\nLocated in the center of downtown Chengdu, Chunxi Road (\u6625\u7199\u8def) is a trendy and bustling commercial strip with a long history. It was built in 1924 and was named after a part of the Tao Te Ching.\nToday, it is one of the most well-known and popular fashion and shopping centers of Chengdu, lined with shopping malls, luxury brand stores, and boutique shops.\n\n\n==== Anren Historic Town ====\nAnren Historic Town is located 39 km (24 mi) west of Chengdu. It was the hometown of Liu Wencai, a Qing dynasty warlord, landowner and millionaire. His 27 historic mansions have been well preserved and turned into museums. Three old streets built during the Republic of China period are still being used today by residents. Museums in Anren have a rich collection of more of than 8 million pieces of relics and artifacts. A museum dedicated to the memorial of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was built in 2010.\n\n\n==== Luodai Historic Town ====\nLuodai was built, like many historic structures in the area, during the period of the Three Kingdoms. According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China. Three or four hundred years ago, a group of Hakka people moved to Luodai from coastal cities.

          "What a fantastic show, never ever expected this , never heard of such a show. Pleasantly surprised. What a spectacular show of song and dance. The main event was the changing face show . How clever it was. The performer was just brilliant, changing his face about thirty times in",
          "I believe that plays and operas are a good window to know old history, tradition and culture of a country and a place. Sichuan Opera was exactly that. After reading great reviews I decided to visit this place. Actual theater is inside a park located on beautiful Qintai Road.",
          "We booked the VIP experience and it was well worth the additional cost. Purchase tickets online or at the box office on Jinlixi street. If you buy the tickets online be sure to first go to the box office first to get your actual tickets. Then you will walk across the street to",
          "Good opera show eventhoug in earlier part of the show, I do not understand the Chinese spoken show. Very nice show of hand shadow attractions with a skillful lady presenting various things by using the shadow on her hands. Also there is comedy show as well. Better to book VIP",
          "Attending the opera was a highlight of our trip to Chengdu and the whole family enjoyed the show. The performers are wonderful: singers, acrobats, shadow puppets. It is all very engaging and entertaining. The face changing act at the end is an incredible finish. The show is",
          "Just plain fun and funny. A lot of talent here in a variety of acts. Impossible to name a standout as they're all excellent. The hand images, the hen-pecked husband with the burning lamp on his head, the violin, . . . Spring for the premium tickets.",
          "We had a very enjoyable evening of watching the Sichuan opera performance of face/mask-changing. The bian lian performers put on a spectacular show of changing their very decorative faceplates in the snap of a split second. At times, the masks were changed multiple times in a",

          "I'm so glad we went to the show! Besides seeing the pandas, this is something everyone should do while visiting Chengdu. After reading all the reviews, we decided to squeeze this in our busy travel schedule and it did not disappoint! We went to the ticket office at 5pm and",
          "When visiting Chengdu, a trip to the Shu Feng Yun Sichuan Opera is a must, in my opinion. There you will see performances seen nowhere else. I especially like the play where a wife forced her husband to wear a lit candle on his head because of his gambling behavior. Although I",
          "Set at a n outdoor teahouse, but covered by a roof, this was a unique cultural experience. We were served tea and dumplings. Servers were available with hot water in pots with 3 foot spouts. The costumes were spectuclar. In several acts the preforms changed costumes or masks on",

          "Book VIP tickets if you can afford to as you are much closer to all the face changing and fire breathing action. The Musicians, actors, singers, dancers, puppeteers and acrobats were very entertaining. Don't miss it. I've been on both my Chengdu trips, the first time not VIP",
          "Not knowing too much about Sichuan opera and having a reluctant husband I had to work hard to persuade to go to an opera show, I chose one that had some of the highlights of traditional entertainment and I\u2018m glad I did so. The 1,5 hours flew past, we had tea and sunflower seeds",

          "Amazing show with all kinds of Chinese culture in it. My boys loved it and so did I. The face changing, fire breathing, and stunts were great. I highly recommend this. Sure, there is a language barrier, but you are in CHINA! You still can enjoy the show and the beautiful",
          "I don\u2019t know what to say really. We didn\u2019t like it. I would have stayed throughout the duration of the show but my wife was tuned off to it. We had already viewed a similar show and have watched Beijing Opera. We weren\u2019t fans then and haven\u2019t become one yet. I just had to try it",
          "Show lasts approx 70 minutes and is a bright and colourful collection of scenes portraying human interactions, traditional operatic costumery, audio, acrobatics, and fascinating, intriguing face changing sequences. I'm still trying to work out how the performers manage to",

          "We were taken there as part of our tour around China and to be truthful I was not looking forward to this at all. I am so glad that I went in the end as it turned out to be one of my favourite nights of the whole trip. I can thoroughly recommend this venue and the performance",
          "A real 'local' theatre, full of Chinese folk to see this 'famous' regional show. Very well put together and colourful, but nothing outstanding until the last act of 'face changing' which really is amazing and made the night special, well worth waiting for.",
          "What a wonderful display of Chinese Art and culture. Beautifully decorated teahouse with equally beautiful costumes and music. Traditional stories told through dancing, singing, puppets, a comedy sketch, and an alluring hand shadow display, all leading up to the local and",
          "It's not opera as we know it in the West but you will not be disappointed with the show. It's acrobatics and story telling together with the amazing face changes. One can soon work out how it is done but this des not take away the fun of seeing it on stage. Thoroughly enjoyed",
          "What an incredible 90 minute (approximately) experience! The \"opera\" is a mixture of Chinese opera, acrobatics, the amazing face changing display, and also an impressive shadow puppet performance. The teahouse was completely full on a Friday night and the crowd (mainly local",
          "The park is the very heart and soul of Sichuan Opera. Traditional stories told by singing, dance, acrobatics, Chinese puppetry, humor, shadow puppets, the magic of face-changing and fire breathing move at a fast pace during the 1 1/2 hour performance. You will enjoy it all!",
          "This was the last thing I did on my two week tour of Sichuan and Tibet and it was fun way to end the trip. The VIP seats include a private car transfer from your hotel. Recommended!",
          "It is about an hour of acrobatics and vaudeville theater, followed by about half an hour of face changing. The performance is smooth, colorful, and a delight to watch. Between the English of the narrator and the partial text on the screens you get an inkling of what is going on,",
          "To start off with I was wondering what I had let myself in for, but after a while I started to get into what was going on and started to really enjoy the show. The show is in Chinese, but there are big screens with translations on either side of the stage. There is traditional",
          "A well done performance The whole atmosphere was conducive to opera Excellent seating with tea served Actors were polished Music was calm Comedy was excellent Well done A must see",
          "This place is like an old movie theater. The show was about 1 hr and 20min. The narrator spoke in Chinese and English, but her English wasn't really good. During the show, the actors will speak Chinese but there are monitors that give an English and Korean translation. The",
          "This Opera house is located inside the Culture Park at Qintai Road. The Opera house has 4 walls with no roof. A piece of canvas serves as a roof, so dress accordingly. We were there early. We went to the dressing room at the side that is for the guests to put on the fancy",
          "An enjoyable show while you visit Chengdu. As you enjoy the show, Local tea and traditional snacks are offered.",
          "Like most tourists, we came to Chengdu primarily to see the Pandas, but our local guide mentioned the possibility of taking in an evening performance of Sichuan Opera. We had already had what we thought was a similar cultural experience in Xi'an and a Kung Fu show in Beijing, so",
          "First, I booked a \"VIP ticket\" on viator that was, at best, misleading, Every level ticket was described by row number, so \"front center\" section meant front row center seats to me--Wrong. I was 4 rows back behind lots of raised cell phones and cameras. the neck massage was",
          "This was a very cool part of our trip. You can go into the makeup room before the show starts and see them putting on their faces for the show. Apparently you can also dress up in the costumes and make up if you get there early enough. During the summer, they will bring hand",
          "This is an hour and quarter show presenting various acts of traditional Sichuan Opera, which combines singing, dancing and acrobatics. The early acts feature several dances, comedy, a \"rolling lamp skit\", shadow puppetry, stick puppets, presented with lots of lighting effects",
          "First of all the show was magnificent. We booked very early and were given free upgrade to excellent seats. The ticket came with 1 snack per person which was really nice. After the show, I stayed back for a makeover session. I tried on 2 costumes and had many pictures taken by",
          "this Sichuan opera has all the attraction for us to learn more about the different art presentation by such talented people. There was so much packed into the 90 minutes show. The music, costumes and colours of this show is something anyone of any age will enjoy A must if you",
          "The Shu Feng Ya Yun Sichuan Opera is a spellbinding mix of the old and the new. Wonderful traditional Sichuan Opera costumes, stories, mask changing, fire breathing and puppetry are mixed with top-notch laser and multimedia effects. This show is not to be missed!!",
          "My wife and I really enjoyed this lively, upbeat show. It had everything, dancing, opera, they're, puppetry. The costume and face changing was really good. We booked through our hotel Wenjun Mansion and had the 2nd best level of seats, and really you could have booked anywhere,",
          "This was a very interesting evening, full of surprices. We thought we were going to an opera performance, but it was much more than that; acrobatics, opera, puppet theatre, shadow theathre, chinese violin, some kind of flute, comedy acting and finally the changing faces. Our",
          "Before you get to the Opera building the outside street s. Photographic paradise. Forget the word Opera the show is certainly not a Chinese Opera but a fabulous Variety show. All acts were superb from stick puppets, traditional music and the unblievable face mask changing.",
          "The sichuan opera show is a mix of different folk arts from the region. There's some dancing, some opera, some theater, some puppetry. The face-changing dance and shadow puppetry is interesting but the rest was forgetable. This is not a classical opera like in western countries,",
          "Initially we thought 280 yuan was quite expensive for a 1 hour 10minute show but it was worth every penny. Quite apart from the acting and dancing which we expected, the show also included acrobatics, fire eating, stick and shadow puppetry and dazzling laser effects. Although",
          "I didn't understand half of it, but I thought that the service given and the performances were great and wonderful. I was entertained throughout the show. You can try puppetry and shadow performance and watch the actors put on make up if you arrive early. The place was easy",
          "The VIP seat costs the equivalent of about $50, which I received for a discounted price of about $43. The VIP price includes the show and a 15 minute massage or ear-picking (which I declined). Since the stage is rather low, the person seating directly in front of me blocked a",

          "This show presents a range Chinese culture - puppets, shadow-puppets, ancient music, comedy, wonderful costumes, and the highlight - the face-changing. It is just incredible how the experts change their masks so quickly it is quite impossible to see them do it. You really must",
          "Chengdu is famous for its pandas, spicy food and opera house. I've seen the cute baby cubs, I adore the Sichuan peppers but I hadn't see the opera yet. Well I'm glad I did something about that. I contacted Victor from Real China Travel and he quickly helped us out. He even got",
          "If you visit Chengdu and don't attend this superb event, you've wasted your time! The Chinese Opera is not like the Western operas. The orchestra, musicians and performers are truly the best in the world, A fantastic 1-1.2 hour show of various wonderful performances, topped",
          "I found some reviews confusing not sure if they are for the opera on the main street or the cultural entertainment at the teahouse in the park. This review is for the teahouse event. For 320RMB we had a seat near the front plus tea and snacks. The show was extremely",
          "I had always wanted to experience Chinese opera and although I am aware that this was not the best show in China, I am still glad I got to see it. I purchased a front row ticket as I am a short person but it is not necessarily worth it (320 RMB). You get free tea and peanuts and",
          "This 'Face Changing Opera' was recommended by Tour Guide who fortunately gave us a full description of the Opera including story line and length of this event. Handy if you attend you know what this Opera is about as the electronic signage does not achieve this goal. Opera had",
          "Staff is incredible friendly. We got VIP tickets in the very firs line. The ticket includes a massage or painting face or dressing like an actor for free. We got the back massage but was painful. On the advertisement they talk about snacks but nothing is for free inside. Only",
          "I've been to other Traditional Chinese Opera performances previously in Hong Kong and Beijing, and this is definetly the weakest one. It is not a play itself, is just a compound of small pieces of different Chinese artistic varieties. In order of playing: Chinese Opera, a guy",
          "We stayed pretty close to the Shufeng Yayun Garden so we simply had to walk there. We bought the second most expensive tickets so we had pretty good seats and they even served us tea together with some nuts and crackers. What we loved was the pre/post opera entertainment,",
          "An interesting and entertaining show in Chengdu. A mix of an opera (drama and comedy), acrobatic, dance and musical show. They use chinese as the language which i don't understand at all, but we can understand little bit through their gesture. Or if you missed, the same show",
          "The show Shu Feng Ya Yun was a variety show that highlighted various acts including the Rolling Oil Lamp in local Sichuan Dialect, puppetry, hand shadow puppets but, my favourite was the face changing. The actors switched from one vivid face to another at lightning speed with a",
          "One of the nicest things about this show is that all the performers looked like they were having the best time, presenting it to us! The costumes, music, \"changing faces\" routine, etc. were all amazing, and all acts were executed with such style and flair. It was truly a great",
          "Great costumes and performances. The admittance price includes Chinese tea and nibbles but there is a very \u2018hard sell\u2019 to get you to part with money for everything else including beer. Also features a bizarre offering of ear cleaning and massage as you watch the show! Absolutely",
          "This is a must do when in Chengdu. All narration is in English and Chinese. The show highlights the ancient art of mask changing. Also features some amazing acrobatics and cultural dress. We really enjoyed this show.",
          "This show is typical Chinese opera. Costumes and acrobats great but for a story line and wow factor you wont find it here. The face changing is amazing and is what it is known for. Chinese people cant keep quiet or stop answering phones during the show let alone arrive late or",
          "I always schedule a visit here. I love the colour, humour and finale of 'changing faces' a firm favourite. Tea served throughout in the comfort of whisker chairs. It's in a delightful street of the more traditional chinese style so don't forget to explore before the theatre as",
          "We went to see this show together with our tour guide, which was really helpful as she could explain the 'local flavor' of the show. Our ticket price included a massage or 'ear cleaning' - we both accepted the massage, but declined the ear cleaning! Once the show began there was",
          "This tea house opera show was great! for only 80 yuan, you get a nice big chair, all the tea you can drink! You can order beers for cheap and can get your face painted. The opera itself is so unique and would recommend it to anyone!",
          "An excellent variety show that includes music, drama, comedy and other performances. The venue is great! A real cultural gem that gives you a great taste of China. If your time is limited and you want a get the feel for local traditional entertainment, you should check this",
          "After a first-rate dinner in this beautiful old teahouse, I was lucky enough to attend a remarkable performance in the theatre. It was in fact a very Chinese variety show with a great range of acts. The most famous is the Face-changing show. Even if you know how it's done it is",
          "Wasn't really sure what to expect from this. It was a strange experience. Trying to watch a show whilst some guy is clanging his metal rods cleaning out ears just to my right, people next to him having massages. People talking on their phone. It was all very distracting.",
          "I liked watching the opera! You even get tea and a snack to eat while you watch. The shadow puppets were my favorite! I even paid $20 for them to do my makeup like the opera singers and they took awesome photos of me!",
          "The costumes were amazing and the face changing moves they do were fascinating. The opera part was good too and they even had screens that translated what was being said in English, Japanese, Korean and of course Chinese. There was also a woman that described the scene we were",
          "A lot of these kinds of cultural shows are kind of low-rent tourist traps, but I thought this one was really cool. Quality production that was very visually appealing, which was highlighted by the face-changing performance. That was the best part for sure. I bought my tickets",
          "It was suggested by our guide to go to the Shu Feng Ya Yun Sichuan Opera. We'd been to a few shows on our journey and the 2 prior had been good so we went off with high hopes. The seating consists of a small table with 5 chairs per setting. Unlimited tea but you also have to",
          "Even considering the pandas, this is the absolute best thing to do in Chengdu. The Flip Flop, Mix and Lazybones hostels have a great deal for a ticket and transportation both ways for 150 RMB. Sam's Guest House has a similar arrangement. The spitting fire is exciting but the",

          "My Husband and I both enjoyed the 90 minute show. We showed up early, watched some of the actors put on elaborate make up and found our seats. We also paid an extra 50 yuan for a shoulder and neck massage. The show included short snips of Sichuan Opera, Shadow play, and face",
          "This Sichuan Opera is a medley of performances bringing to the stage some of the best tea house skits and acts of the last 1000 years. The performers are some of China's best. Every musician is a world class artist. Some have performed worldwide and many have successful",
          "By the looks of things, there's several of these shows in Chengdu. The one that we went to this evening was \"\"fu rong guo cui\"\" according to our tickets. There's quite a mix of things going on, some acrobatics, some fire eating, some dancing, some comedy (judging by the",

          "Suggested to us by our tour guide, we were really glad that we went to see this. A variety of acts including musicians, stick puppets, hand shadows and an amazing costume show where the participants' masks keep changing and you cannot see how! The makeup room is to one side of",

          "There is a mixture of shows to watch - traditional chinese opera, puppet, shadow, comedy and last but not least, the face changing. I would say the show was quite pricey - CNY320 for the first 8-10 rows, but it includes an activity to experience, 4 to choose - opera show",
          "Only see this if you have extra time. You will not miss anything if you do not see the show. The show at times was slow moving and the highlight of the show, the face changing which was impressive was not until the last ten minutes. The aisle of seats were very close",
          "If you can, go to the vip section in the middle, you can see their face expressions and its way funnier. plus you get tea, and snacks, beer, massages and ear cleaning is an option with some extra cost while you enjoy the show! If you go early, you get to see how they get ready",
          "We decided to see the opera last minute. our guide got us very good tickets- 4th row in the center. The opera started slow, but if you hang in there--- it is an amazing show. The face changing is fantastic, and there is a mix of puppets and fire spitting and comedy. There",
          "It was a very wet Sunday evening and we tried to cancel our visit to this show, but how we are pleased we didn't as It is really worth going to see. We paid 240 RMB for our seats and they were nicely located in the second set of seats and we got offered a massage, ear cleaning,",
          "100% worth going to!! I saw the kung fu in Beijing and the acrobats in Shanghai and this was my favourite out of the three!! Truly amazing how talented they are!",
          "This is a truly must visit attraction in Chengdu. It may be slightly modified perhaps to make it more tourist friendly, but the show is truly mesmerizing. It is in fact a variety show that includes some true Chinese Opera pieces, then followed by several other acts including a",
          "This Opera was great. The opera house itself looked lovely and they gave out refillable tea and snacks for you to have during the performances. Definitely worth seeing!",
          "This is really a magical place where you can enjoy with the family the Chinese Culture in many different aspects. I recommend to arrive early, at least 1 hour before the show (aprox 7pm), and enjoy the experience of dressing as a real actor including the make up! Your Children",
          "We've experienced this show twice, and both times it was a favorite for my children. They loved all of the different shows (even the opera one with the singning), but their favorites were the shadow performer, the puppeteer, and of-course, the face-changers. As this was part of",

          "During our stay in Chengdu our local guide recommended this evening event. We were not sure what to expect but we were surprised T how much we enjoyed it. It is like a variety show with many different local skills - the shadow puppets was superb and better than any I have",
          "To experience local entertainment that was very entertaining for us. To have a lot of fun while watching the traditional entertainment, singing and dancing? This was recommended by our guide Ling it was it's a great idea to relax at a teahouse and watch a Sichuan opera show",
          "Decided to go here based on our hostel's recommendation and we weren't disappointed. Unless you speak excellent Chinese I would advise organising this through a hostel or hotel. During the shown the language barrior is not an issue and the story is told by expressions and dance.",

          "This was a wonderful night of cultural and fun entertainment. The performances were excellent and language was not a barrier to my enjoyment. I have been to Chinese Opera before but this experience was the best I have had. If you can go and enjoy the experience here.",
          "This show has everything Chinese. A little opera, lots of face mask changes, different musical solos, hand shadows, puppets, a comedy skit, and more. It is a nice open air pravilon where they serve you tea and you relax and watch the show. Nice old part of town with several",
          "Some Chinese opera, but equal amount of variety show, including hand shadow images, amazing quick mask changes, comedy etc. While there is a little intro to each act in English, our emcee/hostess was very difficult to understand. The theater/stage is essentially open air, roofed",

          "I wouldn't exactly call it an opera but it is a must see. The costumes and face changing were of the highest standards. The Chinese comedy act was a great hit with the local audience - it was a pity our guide had not joined us to interpret. The face changing act at the end of",

          "The costumes were nice, but I didn't like the music or the singing. The narrator spoke in Chinese most of the time and we could not understand the little English she used so we had no idea what was going on. Changing Faces was interesting.",
          "It wasn't fantastic.... There was a violin solo that I was very impressed by. The fire breathing is from a puppet which is also quite a let-down. It was pretty cheap when we bought tickets through our hostel.",
          "It was good, it wasn't fantastic. The performance itself was interesting and lively. I just found the set up and process a bit tired and dated. Culturally very interesting though... I'd look around to find some other alternatives.",
          "This is an absolute tourist trap. This is like Lao She Tea house in Beijing...this has absolutely no value at all. A few okay shows for a mind boggling 300 rmb. With 300 Rmb you can have 2 good meals in Cheng Du. My Wife and I went there because we are writing a book",
          "It was a wonderful night of varied entertainment in a traditional Chinese theatre. Excellent old building and the entertainment gave me a real feel for the history of China.",
          "Nice place to see the opera. The theater is though very touristic. It's also kind of expensive, prices start from 200 and more RMBs for the cheapest to 400 and something. The tea served during the show is not bad, the cheapest seats were ok to see the show and if you have the",
          "Creative, fun, so worth coming here! There are a few parts - acrobatics, hand shadowing, face mask changing, and especially the comedy show - that should not be missed!",
          "What a fascinating show, even though I couldn't understand a word! Before the show started you could watch the cast putting on their wonderful elaborate costumes, and have your photo taken with them. You take your seats and are provided with tea and some rice cake things, which",
          "The show is a series of skits - some very funny and entertaining and well worth the price of admission. My one disappointment was the Mask Change which was why I went in the first place. There were two - one was a young lady with a puppet and it was pretty good. The last act",
          "This was offered on a tour that I was on to China and I was a bit reluctant to go, however my husband talked me into joining him on the experience. What a delight. We were dropped off well before tje show and were given the chance to photograph the performers applying their",

          "This has long been considered the premier location for seeing Sichuan opera, and I'd like to think that it was in fact great in its heyday. Seems to me, though, that they've taken to resting on their laurels. The show was OK, but ironically, the parts that are supposed to shine",
          "I bought tickets for my husband and me (260 CNY apiece) at the tea house theatre itself. There are three tiers of tickets: rows 1-4 are the top band (at, I think 320 CNY apiece), the next 4-5 rows are at 260 CNY and then the last few rows are at 200 CNY apiece. If you do go,",
          "The mask changing is superb and not to be missed. Fair bit of time spent on slapstick comedy in chinese which is hard for the foreign tourist. Good locale and some good performances like shadow figures. Overall pretty good but the one in mount Emei is better.",
          "In spite of the name, this is really a collection of acts. Sip tea while watching brief excerpts from traditional Chinese opera, a henpecked juggler, shadow figures, and ESPECIALLY the face-changing performers. According to my Internet search, there are only about 200",
          "Another great night out. The costumes and make-up were amazing. It's worth going just to watch the girl filling every ones tea cups with her teapot that had a spout a metre long so she could reach into the seats. The acts included a Chinese version of Romeo & Juliet, a man",
          "Yo Yo our tour guide recommended this show and I'm sure I had read about it on TA before. Well I'm glad she reminded me as we went and saw the show and she got us great seats right at the front in the middle. She picked us up at our hotel and took us to the Theatre. The",
          "The highlight of the show is the face changing masks act. The other acts were equally entertaining from the playing of the erhu, to the stick puppets, hand shadow show and the comical bowl rolling act. We were kept mesmerized from start to finish. Even the puppet did a face",
          "The dancing, singing, music, and comedy were excellent, but my favorite was the changing faces. It is a very skilled and mysterious art form!",
          "This is not to be missed. The way they entice you at the very last minute, I cannot say more. If you are not really the kind of person that will enjoy Chinese Opera, be opened for once. You are in China anyway. It's a show that they give, and the FINALE was ever so spectacular.",
          "This show was suggested by a local tour guide which was a suprise. The audience feel part of the performance as the stage is small and intimate. The opening act with about 15 performers in traditional costumes and instruments were a sea of colour and movement on the stage.",
          "Full of color and ancient tradition, this little theatre would help you make lots of memories from your visit to Sichuan province. The street is so charming, and the theatre, very modest but the performance is amazing. The costumes and makeup are so beautiful. Enjoy the show",
          "Again, in a street of re-constructed \"old\" shop-fronts. The smaller venue is more intimate and allows you to watch - and photograph - the actors putting on their make-up. This was tourist GOLD !! I bought my tickets by telephoning a mob number ( found via Google!!!) and a uni",

          "What a hoot. All the histrionics were just wonderful. We sat at the very front in a lounge chair and were served tea and biscuits. The performances were just great, especially the lead actor whose balancing skills were terrific. The whole experience was like stepping back",
          "The opera is performed by a very talented and comedic cast and supported by an equally talented \"orchestra\". The waitresses serving nuts and tea to those on the superior package can be a little distracting but you do not want to be at the back if you want to watch what is going",
          "After visiting the Bejing Opera we were a little reluctant to see another Opera .However we were treated to tea sitting close to the stage and entertained by various acts of Chinese entertainment. If you get there before the show begins you can watch the performers putting on",

          "Definitely worth a visit to see something \"cultural\" on your China visit. Several ticket prices with the only difference being you get a bit closer to the stage. We went for the second cheapest (180RMB) and you could see everything very clearly. Booked through the hotel and they",

It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015.\nHangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\n\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.From 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\nIn February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts.

The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain. There are two causeways across the lake.\nOther places of interest\nGrand Canal, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the Canal in Hangzhou was built in 610 AD.

These islands are different in size and shape, and have distinctive scene.\nLongjing tea fields, west of the lake.In March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a \u20ac40,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture. Zhejiang Provincial Museum (\u6d59\u6c5f\u535a\u7269\u9986) features collection of integrated human studies, exhibition and research with its over 100,000 collected cultural relics.\nThere are lots of theaters in Hangzhou showing performance of opera shows. Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive Bus Rapid Transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Chinese sayings ==\n\nA common Chinese saying about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (simplified Chinese: \u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802, \u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d; traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802, \u4e0b\u6709\u8607\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another popular saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (simplified Chinese: \u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde, \u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde, \u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde, \u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde; traditional Chinese: \u751f\u5728\u8607\u5dde, \u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde, \u5403\u5728\u5ee3\u5dde, \u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom. The head of the Shu Han State in the Three Kingdoms period was seated in Huanglongxi, and for some time, the general government offices for Renshou, Pengshan, and Huayang counties were also located here.\nThe ancient town has preserved the Qing dynasty architectural style, as seen in the design of its streets, shops, and buildings.\n\n\n==== Chunxi Road ====\nLocated in the center of downtown Chengdu, Chunxi Road (\u6625\u7199\u8def) is a trendy and bustling commercial strip with a long history. It was built in 1924 and was named after a part of the Tao Te Ching.\nToday, it is one of the most well-known and popular fashion and shopping centers of Chengdu, lined with shopping malls, luxury brand stores, and boutique shops.\n\n\n==== Anren Historic Town ====\nAnren Historic Town is located 39 km (24 mi) west of Chengdu. It was the hometown of Liu Wencai, a Qing dynasty warlord, landowner and millionaire. His 27 historic mansions have been well preserved and turned into museums. Three old streets built during the Republic of China period are still being used today by residents. Museums in Anren have a rich collection of more of than 8 million pieces of relics and artifacts. A museum dedicated to the memorial of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was built in 2010.\n\n\n==== Luodai Historic Town ====\nLuodai was built, like many historic structures in the area, during the period of the Three Kingdoms. According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China. Three or four hundred years ago, a group of Hakka people moved to Luodai from coastal cities. It has since grown into the largest community for Hakka people.\n\n\n==== Du Fu Thatched Cottage ====\nChinese name \u675c\u752b\u8349\u5802,24 acre, at the western outskirts of Chengdu, adjacent to the Huanhua Xi (Flower Rinsing Creek). Key buildings in the Du Fu Cao Tang Park were constructed in the early 16th century during the Ming dynasty and extensively renovated in 1811 during the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChina's state council has designated Chengdu as the country's western center of logistics, commerce, finance, science and technology, as well as a hub of transportation and communication. It is also an important base for manufacturing and agriculture.\nAccording to the World Bank's 2007 survey report on global investment environments, Chengdu was declared \"a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China\".Also based on a research report undertaken by the Nobel economics laureate, Dr. Robert Mundell and the celebrated Chinese economist, Li Yining, published by the State Information Center in 2010, Chengdu has become an \"engine\" of the Western Development Program, a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China, and a major leader in new urbanization.\nIn 2010, 12 of the Fortune 500 companies, including ANZ Bank, Nippon Steel Corporation, and Electricit\u00e9 de France, have opened offices, branches, or operation centers in Chengdu, the largest number in recent years.

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom. The head of the Shu Han State in the Three Kingdoms period was seated in Huanglongxi, and for some time, the general government offices for Renshou, Pengshan, and Huayang counties were also located here.\nThe ancient town has preserved the Qing dynasty architectural style, as seen in the design of its streets, shops, and buildings.\n\n\n==== Chunxi Road ====\nLocated in the center of downtown Chengdu, Chunxi Road (\u6625\u7199\u8def) is a trendy and bustling commercial strip with a long history. It was built in 1924 and was named after a part of the Tao Te Ching.\nToday, it is one of the most well-known and popular fashion and shopping centers of Chengdu, lined with shopping malls, luxury brand stores, and boutique shops.\n\n\n==== Anren Historic Town ====\nAnren Historic Town is located 39 km (24 mi) west of Chengdu. It was the hometown of Liu Wencai, a Qing dynasty warlord, landowner and millionaire. His 27 historic mansions have been well preserved and turned into museums. Three old streets built during the Republic of China period are still being used today by residents. Museums in Anren have a rich collection of more of than 8 million pieces of relics and artifacts. A museum dedicated to the memorial of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was built in 2010.\n\n\n==== Luodai Historic Town ====\nLuodai was built, like many historic structures in the area, during the period of the Three Kingdoms. According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China. Three or four hundred years ago, a group of Hakka people moved to Luodai from coastal cities. It has since grown into the largest community for Hakka people.\n\n\n==== Du Fu Thatched Cottage ====\nChinese name \u675c\u752b\u8349\u5802,24 acre, at the western outskirts of Chengdu, adjacent to the Huanhua Xi (Flower Rinsing Creek). Key buildings in the Du Fu Cao Tang Park were constructed in the early 16th century during the Ming dynasty and extensively renovated in 1811 during the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChina's state council has designated Chengdu as the country's western center of logistics, commerce, finance, science and technology, as well as a hub of transportation and communication. It is also an important base for manufacturing and agriculture.\nAccording to the World Bank's 2007 survey report on global investment environments, Chengdu was declared \"a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China\".Also based on a research report undertaken by the Nobel economics laureate, Dr. Robert Mundell and the celebrated Chinese economist, Li Yining, published by the State Information Center in 2010, Chengdu has become an \"engine\" of the Western Development Program, a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China, and a major leader in new urbanization.\nIn 2010, 12 of the Fortune 500 companies, including ANZ Bank, Nippon Steel Corporation, and Electricit\u00e9 de France, have opened offices, branches, or operation centers in Chengdu, the largest number in recent years.

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses.

Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks.

A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China.

Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range.

The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems.

More than 20 real estate companies set up in Chengdu, which was the first step for Chengdu's real estate development. The comprehensive Funan River renovation project in the 1990s had been another step towards promoting Chengdu environmental development.

Three of the roads supported the east part of the city, the other two led to the south. It established the foundation of the Eastern and Southern sub-centers of Chengdu. The two major sub-centers determined people's eastward and southward living trends. Large numbers of buildings appeared around the east and south of the 2nd Ring Road. The Shahe River renovation project together with Jin River project also set off a fashion for people living by the two rivers. It was said that the map of Chengdu should update every three months.In 2000, dozens of commercial real estate projects also appeared. While promoting the real estate market, the Chinese government encouraged citizens to buy their own houses by providing considerable subsidies. Houses were included in commodities.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nChengdu is served by the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport located in Shuangliu County 16 km (9.9 mi) southwest of downtown. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the busiest airport in Central and Western China and the nation's fourth-busiest airport in 2018, with a total passenger traffic of 53 million in 2018. Shuangliu Airport is one of the two core hubs for Air China, together with Beijing, as well as the main hub and headquarters for Sichuan Airlines.

The Chengdu Railway Bureau manages the railway system of Sichuan Province, Chongqing City, Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province. Chengdu has four main freight railway stations. Among them, the Chengdu North Marshalling Station is one of the largest marshalling stations in Asia. Since April 2013, companies are able to ship goods three times a week (initially only once a week) to Europe on trains originating from Chengdu Qingbaijiang Station bound for \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. It is the first express cargo train linking China and Europe, taking 12 days to complete the full journey.\nThere are three major passenger stations servicing Chengdu: Chengdu Railway Station (commonly referred to as the \"North Station\"), Chengdu South Railway Station (ChengduNan) and Chengdu East Railway Station (ChengduDong). In addition, Chengdu West Railway Station is scheduled to open by 2030.Chengdu is the terminus of the Baoji-Chengdu railway, the Chengdu-Chongqing railway, the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Chengdu-Dazhou railway, the Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Lanzhou railway, the Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway, and the Chengdu-Dujiangyan high-speed railway.\nThe Chengdu\u2013Dujiangyan high-speed railway is a high-speed rail line connecting Chengdu with the satellite city of Dujiangyan and the Mountain Qingcheng World Heritage Site.

There will also be a road that connects Longquan Town to Longquan Lake; it is connected to the Chengdu\u2013Jianyang Expressway and hence shorten the journey by 10 km (6.2 mi). By the end of 2008, there are ten expressways, connecting the centre of Chengdu to its suburbs. The expressways are Chenglin Expressway, extensions of Guanghua Avenue, Shawan Line, and an expressway from Chengdu to Heilongtan.\nThe toll-free Chengjin Expressway in the east of Chengdu is 38.7 km (24.0 mi) long. After it opens to the public, it will take only about half an hour to drive from central Chengdu to Jintang, half the time of the current journey.\nThe expressway between Chengdu to Heilongtan (Chengdu section), going to the south of the city, is 42 km (26 mi) long. It is also toll-free and a journey from downtown Chengdu to Heilongtan will only take half an hour.\nThe extension of Guanghua Avenue, going towards the west of the city.

However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou\u2014both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways\u2014on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.\n\n\n== Education ==\nChengdu is home to the greatest number of universities and research institutes in Southwestern China.

The Chinese government is aiming to increase that by 15 percent every year. The nation's tennis market has reached $4 billion annually, according to Tom Cannon, a professor and sports finance expert at the University of Liverpool Management School in England.\nThe women's tour upgraded the China Open in Beijing to become the only combined event with the men's tour in Asia.

          "As I am over 60 I chose this trip as it had a cable car. But the cable car only went up about a third of the mountain. So it was a hard climb. Having said that, the temples on the way up are very interesting. The view at the top was OK as there were clouds and mist. However",
          "The serene beauty of this place is well worth the travel. The temples are gorgeous and the place feels calm even when crowded with visitors. If you are challenged by the walk you can be carried up the steps! The lake and chairlift are worth seeing too.",

          "It's definitely worth visiting for people interested in taoism and Chinese culture. However, there is no much to see for nature lovers. All the walkways have proper wooden paths/stairs. There are too many souvenir/snack shops along the way. My family and I visited Mt Qingcheng",

          "This bridge is another world when you go at night. It takes your breath away watching it from afar. I think the only inconvenience was the fact that I took a cab first to walk there and then going back to my hotel area to eat I had to take a bus because the train station doesn't",

          "This really is a spectacular view. Frankly, I don't care of its more Disney than China, its an amazing photo, or in my case about 15. The bar area along the side feels like Soho London on a balmy summer evening, but better. Wish I could have stayed.",

        "wiki": "Dujiangyan (Chinese: \u90fd\u6c5f\u5830; pinyin: D\u016bji\u0101ngy\u00e0n) is a county-level city of Sichuan Province, Southwest China, it is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Chengdu. Its north-west region forms a border with southern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. It has an area of 1,208 km2 (466 sq mi) and had a population of 600,000 in 2003.Dujiangyan was formerly a county named Guanxian or Guan County (\u704c\u53bf; '\"irrigation\" county'). The county became a county-level city in 1988 and was renamed after the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, in the city's northwest, famous for providing Chengdu with water for over two millennia, since around 250 BC.\n\n\n== History ==\nAround 250 BC during the Warring States period, Li Bing, a governor of Shu (present Sichuan Province) in the Qin state with his son directed the construction of Dujiangyan. Li Bing gave up the old ways of dam building, which were simply directed at flood control, employing a new method of channeling and dividing the water of the Min River. He accomplished this by separating the project into two main parts: the headwork and the irrigation system.  The whole system has functioned for 2,000 years, preventing floods and providing substantial irrigation and facilitating shipping and wood drifting. It has contributed greatly to the richness of Chengdu Plain with its reputation as \"The Land of Abundance\".On 12 May 2008, the city was the closest to the epicenter of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the city suffered severe damage. Xinjian Primary School, Juyuan Middle School, and Xiang'e Middle School collapsed in the earthquake.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nDujiangyan has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) with cool, dry winters and hot, very wet summers.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nDujiangyan has 17 towns and two townships:\n\nTowns:\nGuankou (\u704c\u53e3\u9547)\nXingfu (\u5e78\u798f\u9547)\nPuyang (\u84b2\u9633\u9547)\nJuyuan (\u805a\u6e90\u9547)\nChongyi (\u5d07\u4e49\u9547)\nTianma (\u5929\u9a6c\u9547)\nShiyang (\u77f3\u7f8a\u9547)\nLiujie (\u67f3\u8857\u9547)\nYutang (\u7389\u5802\u9547)\nZhongxing (\u4e2d\u5174\u9547)\nQingchengshan (\u9752\u57ce\u5c71\u9547)\nLongchi (\u9f99\u6c60\u9547)\nXujia (\u80e5\u5bb6\u9547)\nAnlong (\u5b89\u9f99\u9547)\nDaguan (\u5927\u89c2\u9547)\nZipingpu (\u7d2b\u576a\u94fa\u9547)\nCuiyuehu (\u7fe0\u6708\u6e56\u9547)\nTownships:\nXiang'e (\u5411\u5ce8\u4e61)\nHongkou (\u8679\u53e3\u4e61)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nChina National Highway 317\nChengdu\u2013Dujiangyan High-Speed Railway\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n \u014ctake, Hiroshima, Japan\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDujiangyan Irrigation System\nKuiguang Pagoda\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Dujiangyan.\" ChinaCulture. 2003.

          "It is important when going to this place to learn about the irrigation system. I borrowed the audio guide and it gave a little insight, but I believe the books they sell in English probably is better. Be aware that there is a pretty high entrance fee to this attraction. It is",
          "This is a major engineering feat, but sadly my little guide/shepherd, didn't know HOW it was built, just that it diverted water. By an amazing coincidence I happened to be reading a biography of Joseph Needham and got a bit more information. After the stone levees were in",

          "To see is to believe. Until you see it, you will understand the fundamental of this water system that benefits thousands of people in Chengdu valley. The concept of \"divide and conquer\" is more powerful than damming the water. It is a live example of the system that lasts",
          "We went over on weekend during rainy day by bullet train from Chengdu railway station. Dam construction is really master piece of Chinese engineering build 2000+ years ago. Town is small, around river is most attractive place to visit. Town has mix of old and new buildings,",

          "Not entirely sure of how our day would pan out we hopped on a bus from the station in chengdu to get to Dujiangyan. From there we hopped on local bus and jumped off when we saw the water! Walk up to the temples in the mountain and through the west pass before arriving at weir",
          "It is mind boggling to know that the system was designed and built about 2200 years ago and it is still functioning. The place is about two hours away from Chengdu city and there are buses to this town (if you know which bus and which bus station). It is hard to go around",
          "We started at the top and went comfortably downstairs through temples and over the hanging bridge. Lots to see but without any information hard to understand and no one to understand English. So go there with a guide like Haba who we recommend highly.",
          "Dujiangyan is an amazing feat of engineering, but you do have to understand how it works in order to truly appreciate it and get the most out of your visit. Otherwise, it's really just a river with a few gazebos and dams here and there. Don't expect canals or aqueducts. I",
          "Besides the Panda's, Chengdu is home to one of the oldest pieces of ancient civil engineering that is still in use today. While the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 destroyed many buildings in the area, the irrigation system stood, demonstrating the sheer strength of this marvel. You",

          "I went with a local Chinese tour, that operated daily from the city center. This is a historical attraction, which combined ancient Chinese engineering with great scenery. I would recommend climbing the temple/ tower across the river in order to get an even better view. However,",
          "The DuJiangYan Irrigation System is located in Sichuan Province about one hour west of the Provincial Capital of Chengdu by car or less than thirty minutes by the high-speed train departing from Chengdu\u2019s North train station. I lived and worked in Chengdu for six years enabling",
          "Due to the mix review about this attraction, we almost skipped this place. But on the second thought since we never been to such a very old irrigation system why not? Thinking that it must be a strong justification why this place is one of the world heritage, so the very last",
          "To be privileged enough to see an irrigation site that is over 2,000 years old is really something. We hired a driver to take us here from Chengdu and it was a really good day. If you have a day available this Irrigation System is fully recommended for viewing.",
          "It is worth seeing if U have nothing else to do , a walk by the river to see an old irrigation system that was built over 2000 years ago . . LONG walk and nothing to see .",

          "Not a difficult place to find, either take the subway (line 2 to Xipu) and take a train or just take the train from Chengdu North Station. The world heritage site is pretty large so allow all day. It isn't as exciting as it sounds but even the air is better here. See the",
          "There is not much to see but if you are in Chengdu, it is worth to visit to check out; it is similar to other national parks in China with some water fountains, statues. It is outside Chengdu city center about 30 minutes drive depending where you came from. You have to pay the",

          "Do it! Walk the whole route, maybe not all the way up to the highest temple but it's worth it. This is from a mostly sedentary mid 40's woman, trust me - it's worth the climb!",
          "Go on a nice day and wear comfortable shoes as it is a long walk with lots of opportunity to climb high up visiting the various temples. It is well worth climbing the numerous staircases as the views are spectacular. The dam is interesting to see and the scenery is worth a look.",

          "I was not expected to see tons of Chengdu local foods around these streets. They were all tasted and cheap to my standard. Some of the foods might seem weird for non Asian as they offered delicacy food like Rabbit head. Tea houses were everywhere. You can see that people in",
          "The Wide & Narrow Streets of Kuanzhai Alley are typical of other tourist-centric streets elsewhere: Yangshuo's West St., Hangzhou's Hefang St, Shanghai's Tianzifang St., even Chengdu's other shopping area, Jinli St. All are streets once lined with old homes and shops, now",

          "Along with Jinli street, this is one of the main attractions of Chengdu when you are not watching pandas. I\u2019d recommend seeing this street before Jinli. This is a little more commercial and I thought the stores a little less quality, more souvenirs. However, the tea houses and",
          "Visited the Kuanzhai Alley (= wide and narrow alleys in Chinese) at night, it was crowded and fun. This old district has a history dating back to the Qing dynasty and today they're conserved and revitalized to be a shopping district. There were lots of interesting shops /",

          "This place is the usual street alley like what you can find in other China cities. Lots of local street food and handicrafts for you to spend your monies. Getting here is super easy since there is a subway station name after it under Line1.",

          "Half authentic, half new, it was a nice place to stroll around. Some things are a surprise to see, then there are things you'd expect at a Chinese alley. Just go with it! We had some lovely little potatoes- eat them with a toothpick, they were a little spicy, but very nice!",
          "Restored alleys with shops and food. LOTS of people. Nothing really special to see, eat, or buy. I wouldn't describe it as \"authentic\" at all. We did stop in to see a show (it was the first such place on the left hand side as you're entering the alley, located on the 2nd floor",

          "Variety of local and fad food and souvenirs. The modernised old structures blends well in the atmosphere of the area. Many restaurants there provide shows, such the Sichuan's fast changing masks and Chinese opera, hence the cost of meals are expensive.",

          "Walked here from the hotel based on a recommendation from the concierge. Interesting place with lots of shops, restaurants, bars and food vendors. Makes for a nice night time activity, but it is a little expensive. Also found out it is a area that was recently built, but it is",
          "We went on a Saturday close to the Qing Ming holiday. It was busy, but not overwhelming by China standards. Lots to see and sample. Plenty of interesting architecture, artisans, food and unrushed corners to enjoy a meal. We came as a family group and all enjoyed the",
          "This place has a rich history and hence it is full of visitors even during wkdays. It has alot of souvenior shops, pubs and snack counters. There are decorations on the walls which depics the ancient story. Interesting place.",
          "The area has changed in recent years. It is no longer a collection of really up-market restaurants, and today houses many moderate low cost local eateries. Several Sichuan face changing shows which may be worth a visit.",
          "Walked here at the suggestion of one of the folks at our hotel. A really eclectic mix of traditional architecture, galleries, shops, bars and restaurants....while it is busy, at least you don\u2019t have to dodge mopeds.",

          "I visited here with my friends. There are 3 streets and a lot of shops. The buildings were unexpectedly built recently, though they look like old town. I recommend you will try XiaoChi in this area. These are cheap and delicious. If you\u2019re looking for some souvenirs, you",
          "Spend some time there if you are new to Chengdu. There are lots of restaurants and small eateries to try out local delicacies. There also are interesting shops that make the trip enjoyable. Make sure to take a walk in the different alleys, they lead to different parts of the",
          "These alleyways are perfect for those looking for a gift to take home. Rebuilt in the late 1990s -2000s the shops offer a variety of local crafts and food. A hint to the visitor, use the bathroom before visiting here as the \u2018facilities\u2019 are not great.",

          "Standard mix of funky souvenir shops, tea shops, art displays, etc. Very cute, \"cultural\" architecture, but obviously a bit tourist-y. There is a Starbucks, after all. It was fun to wander & pop in the shops, and there was decent coffee to be had. Bar-wise, though, the next",
          "This area is so popular among the locals & foreigners! What\u2019s fascinated me is has a mixed culture between the west & east. All the decor & display of shop front are very trendy & fashionable but with a touch of the chinese culture. Love to visit the tea house!",
          "Loved strolling these alleys even though it was a bit crowded, that\u2019s the downfall, but it\u2019s China expect crowds! Come here with a bit of an empty stomach to get a sample of all the little street foods. This place is a little gimmick (as with any tourist spot) but nonetheless",

          "We walked here at KuanZhai Alley after our dinner and immediately I felt that even if we came here directly for dinner at KuanZhai Alley we would have enjoyed our experiences here. KuanZhai Alley offers a lot of unique night bars with live music, or quiet teahouse to enjoy",
          "We came here knowing that it is a commercial tourist spot with lots of shops and local eateries. We tried quite a few of the eateries and saw a lot of interesting shops. When we got tired, we just stopped at a tea shop and drank some fruity drinks. The place is clean (including",
          "I loved the alleys in downtown Chengdu, both Kuanzhai and the parallel streets, they have unique street sculptures, nice tea houses, Chinese \"Xiao Chi\" (small bites) and fancy restaurants to please the most picky of tourists. A real delight not to miss while in Chengdu.",
          "Really nice spot. Popular with locals & tourists alike so probably better to visit on a weekday. I go every time we come back to Chengdu.",
          "Excellent experience soaking in the architecture and ambience, with shops peddling traditional crafts and foods. Highly recommended to visit. Go early to avoid the crowds, especially on weekends.",

          "Very pretty streets, since we where there in mid December and it was quite cold, there were not too many people, but I suppose this area gets crowded during high season. Nevertheless it's very pretty, lots of nice doors and good food too. Definitely recommend spending a few",

          "Every stores and cafe is unique and have beautiful decor. It is worth browsing each of them. My favorite store is \"Swarka\" which has Indian/Nepali theme to it.",
          "This place is like Chinatown of London/New York. When I said this, I meant, it's a re-built place that is meant for tourist. Kuanzhai alley actually made up of 3 parts, the wide alley (Kuan), the narrow (zhai) alley, and the well alley. The busy part is at the wide and narrow",
          "I was full of excitement before visiting the KuanZhai alley thinking that this might be an authentic looking streets from the past. However, the modern looking shops spoil the authenticity of these 2 alley. Just an hour is enough if you only want to walk down these 2 alleys.",

          "Love this place. Very well thought out preservation project turning it into a very touristic place, and a highly successful one too. The concept and architectural planning, commercial fit-outs of the entire place makes one feel like stepping back in time, 300+ years ago into the",

          "This place is quite similar to Jinli Street, full of shops and restaurants. But I find some of the shops here are more well decorated compare to Jinji Street. I enjoyed the Chinese architecture buildings and decorations and took many pictures. No entry fee is required. It is",
          "more expensive than other sites for street food but clean and delicious. also a good place for souvenirs.",
          "I like Jingli lane more, this alley has many nice shops and restraurants but they are expensive than other place in Chengdu, probably because it's too famous and popular. Unless you like to enjoy the wine here in the bars and watch the traditional opera trick called \"change",
          "These are a reconstruction of the old city market alleys - the wide and the narrow streets. They are filled with shops and people, lots of people. It's more touristy but worth a visit.",
          "Lots of tea shops and food stalls / restaurants to explore, and to give visitors a taste of Chengdu culture. If you want the same experience without the crowds (and maybe more authentic), try visiting Kuixinglou Street, a few streets to the North.",
          "Pretty good place for shopping and eating. Many tourists and thus rather packed. Teahouses are plenty and they are a nice place to sit down and rest for a while.",
          "I was very impressed with the Kuanzhai Alley and other surrounding areas. What a wonderful place for tourists - teeming with people but organised chaos, this place has some of the most beautiful shops and lots of fabulous restaurants which provide entertainment including the",

          "This famous tourist area is also known as Wide & Narrow Alleys. There are three parallel ancient city alleys, named Wide, Well and Narrow as well as numerous courtyards along them. They are popular for tourists as you can see in the photo\u2019s; where there are restaurants, pubs,",
          "Cool but touristy! Lots to eat, lots to look at and lots of people. But fun we came back twice. And ate here twice! Better to come in the evening less people. Starts to get much quieter around 9-930 but will close around 10",

          "Mostly restored or recreated. It\u2019s a fun destination to visit for local snacks, food, souvenirs etc. We went there in the evening & decided it was worth a second visit during the day. You can easily spend 3 hours there including a break for either lunch, afternoon tea or dinner.",
          "The usual commercialisation of a Chinese heritage area. Traditional architectures mixed in with many restaurants and cafes serving up a variety of cuisines. Weekends are super crowded as usual but you can find a nice place to watch the people walking pass and enjoy a cuppa.",
          "Very well appointed for city tourism. You will feel like walking in the past with lots of historical old building although they are turned it into something else now. You still can see some are kept like it was and well preserved.",
          "I see from comments below that people visiting during the day found the alley too crowded and hectic. We went on a Sunday evening (about 9pm), and we didn't have that problem at all. There were still enough people in the alley to give it atmosphere, but it still felt very calm",
          "I went on a Saturday and it was so crowed and chaotic that I wasnt able to enjoy it. A bit too commercial for me. Recommend Jinlin street instead.",
          "I enjoyed my 1-2 hours here. It is a pleasant place to have a wander around. There are a number of places where you can try different types of Sichuan food. The Wren Restaurant (pictured) was a convenient (although a bit more expensive) way of trying different Sichuan cuisine",
          "There were so many people - domestic and foreignt tourists visiting the 2 alleys. Best to visit in the morning, where there are lesser crowds, so that we you can better appreicate the alley ways and architecture. We visited in July, and in the afternoon, the weather became too",

          "Yep just like its description Kuanzhai Alley, is a warren of shops in varying sized alleys. We enjoyed wondering around and seeing all sorts of different souvenirs and food. We did prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street for its atmosphere though...",
          "We went here because we heard there was a traditional hot pot restaurant that also had the face changing opera as entertainment. We really enjoyed the traditional Sichuan hotpot and the face changing opera was a real highlight and something that the whole family will not",
          "If you're looking for crowds and overpriced shopping, this is the place for you. This is a popular place for domestic tourists, and the day we were there it was so crowded we couldn't wait to get through it and on to something more relaxing.",
          "this is a very popular destination for a lot of foreigners as well as out of town visitors from other parts of China or Asia. I can't see the attration, unless you've never seen one before. I would say it's ok for a first visit, just to say been there done that. The area is",
          "Prefer Jinli because more picturesque- but if u have time for both, would recommend. Some of the shops are same branch on both streets. Pedestrian only street lined with shops selling local foods, handicrafts and anything else imaginable. Great way to immerse in the food culture",

          "The narrow and wide alleys (there are three of them in the same area) are great to spend a couple of hours wandering through imagining how it used to be in decades gone by. They tried to keep them as authentic as possible while they serve a modern purpose - shopping, eating,",
          "Touristy but wonderful markets, such a variety of shops and things to eat. You can sit in on a play for a small fee also. We ventured less than 50m from here and found a very local Chinese market",
          "This was a lot like several other pedestrian zones we've visited on our trip. It had a lot of clothing and souvenir shops, many open to bargaining. There were also many places that sold Sichuan peppercorns, peppers, & hot pot concentrate. The street food looked really good, but",
          "Lovely place with a lot of history. Here you can clean your ears, in the old traditional way, for about 60 yuan. Nice restaurants and bars and a lot to see. Crowded place, but very nice.",
          "Yes, it is terribly crowded as are all tourist areas in China. But the ancient architecture, shops, and restaurants offer something for everyone. Lots of Sichuan snacks and restaurants, but also pubs featuring pizza and western food. Touristy \"face changing\" and Chinese opera",
          "Many food, drinks, restaurants, history, shops, souvenirs items and they have a lot to offer. Was great to visit from afternoon till evening",
          "You can wander through the alleys (there are several in this network) to find food, ice cream, souvenirs, and crafts. We found a really pretty handmade silver filigree jewelry store that was stunning. This shop is tucked away in an enclave of other shops, and not visible from",
          "It\u2019s made for tourist and the whole place is usually flooded by tourist from other cities in China. Sometimes locals do venture there for tea as well. If you are visiting Chengdu, might as well come and visit the streets and window shop. No need to buy any of the exorbitantly",

          "I went because this was one of the go-to places in Chengdu, and my family was on a group tour. The experience was marred by the holiday crowd (I went on the eve of a long 3 day public holiday), which made it difficult to move, much less enjoy the surroundings. Many parts of the",

          "Its a short street with many shops for tourists. Because we were on a hot noon, we didn't do much except walking through the street. We did stopped for lunch. The shop was busy, but the food was a disappointment.",

          "So much to see and do, shops of every variety, a great many nationalities. Noisy and bustling it was great. Take some time to stop and look, there is a lot to see. Plenty of places for food and drink, and you can even get your ears cleaned (a local speciality). As I am a",

          "A restored street built in the style of original architecture. A great place to wander and munch in the food stalls.",
          "We had heard rave reviews about this place, and on arrival we were not disappointed. It looks amazing, and is great to spend an hour or so threading your way through thousands and thousands of other tourists. Some amazing shops and food. The reason for the three stars is that",
          "This is, as may be expected, a commercialised area. Nevertheless, it is worth a visit for the various shops, the wall murals, and probably the teahouses which offer traditional tea in opera houses. For the latter, I suspect that it is better than that at Shufengyayun; they are",

          "Jinli and the wide and narrow alleys are the southern China version of the BeiJing Hutongs, and although these places to me don\u2019t have a really authentic feel about them, I think they are worth a visit... well at least one of them, the question is which one? I\u2019ve been several",
          "Though this is a tourist trap, it's a fun one. Visiting on a Saturday afternoon, the alleys were full of people, though this made for entertaining people-watching. The area is clean for the amount of traffic seen there. The shop buildings are well-restored.",
          "We spent one evening wandering these streets and had a great time. We would have liked more time here but were sadly leaving Chengdu the following day. These alleys are packed full of shops, tea shops, bakeries, restaurants and bars. It was very busy though when we were there",
          "This is a good place to see a cleaned up version of a traditional Chinese shopping/tea house area but don\u2019t go at peak times. I walked through here on a Saturday afternoon on my way back from the Yongling museum and these \u201calleys\u201d were so packed that you could hardly walk.",

          "They did a pretty good job with this place as far as how it looks, I enjoyed the monochromatic photo/sculpture things on display in the streets.

          "Here, the exterior of each building has been kept as its original looks. Inside the building, new things are exhibited. Thus you can buy something special or stuff with Chengdu style. Also, you can taste transitional Sichuan gourmet.",
          "We were disappointed with these streets. The beautiful old houses were overshadowed by the commercialism - pointless jewellery stores, tacky souvenirs and even a Starbucks. It would have been nice if they'd left the buildings without the need to fill them with tacky shops.",
          "This is not a typical downtown. Most of the boutique here and restaurant were designed culturally. If you were bargain hunter and a food enthusiast, this area is perfect for you.",
          "This street is a must-go in Chengdu, gorgeous little alleyways and reasonably (most of them anyway!) priced shops. Food is a little more pricey, but a lot of places do a Sichuanese opera (the one we saw was completely in Chinese) but I would still recommend even if you are not a",
          "Busy streets with no motorised tragic but very crowded with people. Stores are a bit higher prices as elsewhere but they are also better decorated and good athmosphere.",

          "Spending half a day walking up and down these alleys is a great way to get to know more about the cultural heritage in Chengdu. They are within walking distance of the town centre or if you don't feel like it, you can always take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the",
          "After almost two years working around Xichuan Province in China I got a recommendation to visit this place called Narrow & Wide alley (in English). It turned to be one of the best experience in Chengdu. There you can have a real taste of local culture including souvenirs,",
          "It's surprisongly enjoyable visit. There is quite a few things to do especially eating small meals throughout. There is also entertainment such as performances where you can sit down to relax.",
          "It's probably the most famous tourist spot in Chengdu city. So if you come to visit Chengdu, you are more than likely ending up here one time -- and one time is enough. It has been modernized so much that it is clearly catered to tourists -- foreign or domestic. Local people",
          "This pedestrian zone is really a wonderful place for tourists. Yes, it's touristy, but that's because they've done a good job of restoring the architecture to its original beauty and then filled each building with restaurants, shops, food stalls, and tea houses. It was mobbed",
          "Really worthy ur half day time visiting there and try everything you see, I believe you will love it. Do slow down ur steps and enjoy it.",
          "Chinese locals don\u2019t frequent this area as it is catered to tourists. We definitely had fun here as the streets are teaming with happy tourists gathered in small and narrow streets. The buildings are restored to resemble the old Qing Dynasty. You will just follow the crowds of",
          "I visited on a weekend and the alleys were throbbing with life. There are man F&B outlets and some upscale shops but I visited mainly to enjoy the vibrance. The old buildings were beautifully restored and an abundance of trees with green and yellow foliage made postcard pretty",
          "My overall score is three stars: fairly interesting, you won't regret visiting Unlike Jinli Pedestrian Street (see my other review), this area actually does have historical roots -- having been the site of a Manchu garrison -- but much seems to have been recently remodelled or",
          "Kuanzhai Ancient Street is quite famous, but I have been to many other cities in China and most of them have similar walking street. The food there is so so, I have 2 friends lived in Chengdu and they said actully the local doesn't visit this place and told me the food there is",
          "Crowded, lots of shops and trinkets - lots of panda merch but nothing really special. This area has alot of Sichuan opera/changing faces shows. Tickets range from 48 - 88 rmb in most places. I do always enjoy China at night when everything is lit up so if you stay until",
          "We took bus service 57 outside Jinli Pedestrian Walk for CNY1 and took a few minutes walk to this place. There are plenty of interesting shops and many very modern tea-houses here. It was quite crowded during our visit. The Chinese food can be rather intriguing with rabbit",
          "Visited both here and Jinli but I liked this area better as featured more of the teahouses and inns of Chengdu. Any visitor to Chengdu should do either here or Jinli but I recommend this area above Jinli.",
          "Similar to Jinli street, the streets are cleaner, buildings are older. There is a nice Starbuck here worth a visit!",
          "We went twice to the alleys and the best was in the evening when all the lights were on and the lanterns glowing. Some interesting displays and houses if you take the time to look at them as well as a good range of shops.",
          "Some confusion due to the three names in use for this pedestrian street, but certainly more pleasant to visit then Jinli Street. Lots of lovely sculptures - Chengdu has much public art - and Panda related merchandise is cheaper than at the Panda Research Base.",
          "Yes, lots of good shops -- from hammered silver to traditional souvenirs-- but be sure to enjoy the architecture that those ships enhabit. The alleys are very crowded on weekends. We went back during the week and found it much easier to navigate.",
          "walking street in Chengdu... worth spend some time here to explore the few alleys.... good place to take photos as well....",
          "A must go place in cheng du. Interesting food and alleys. Highly recommended. A lot of food and things to buy",
          "Similar to Jingli, lots of shops and restaurants in narrow streets. However, the overall feel is more upscale compared to Jingli. May uniquely designed or decorated stores. The restaurants are more formal, the foods offered are more sophisticated. Worth checking out.",
          "It is located at the downtown of Chengdu, taking Metro (subway) to Kuanzhai Xiang \u5bbd\u7a84\u5df7\u5b50 station is one of the best way to beat the heavy traffic of Chengdu, which cost you approx. RMB2/trip from ChunXi Road (where my hotel located). It is consisted of 3 streets which originated",

          "We enjoyed our walk down this street so much that we decided to visit twice during our stay in Chengdu. Both times however it was extremely crowded and difficult to walk through. There are a lot of nice restaurants and cafes to hide away from the crowds when it all gets too",
          "Cute walking lane full of nice architecture, good place to pick up some souvenirs and talk a walk, can be a little crowded though",
          "We spent around an hour to tour this place on our last day in chengdu . As expected this is a tourist place which exists in almost every chinese tourist city . The place was packed with tourists during lunch hour . The three streets were filled with small restaurants selling",
          "We arrived there on a Chinese holiday, the number of people was crazy. A lovely place, things on the walls, Chinese addresses, many restaurants and especially full shops, souvenirs, the perfect place for those who need a few more things.",
          "Similar in concept to JinLi street. However I find the kuanzhai street was more interesting. It was made up of wide alley, narrow alley and wells alley. The former two were more famous and more funfare and crowded while the latter was almost devoided of human traffic. This could",
          "Our tour group was en route to a local Hotpot restaurant for dinner. We had a pit-stop at Kuan & Zhai Alley to wander round by ourselves for an hour. Fascinating place. But for me it will always be remembered as the place I had my ears cleaned! The ancient practice of ear",
          "We went early in the day 9.30am and felt like we had the place to ourselves. By 10.30am the tourists began to arrive. This is more upmarket than anywhere else we had visited in China. The artwork on the walls, the shops, and tasteful designed buildings all add to the ambience.",
          "Like many attractions labeled Ancient, it really isn't that ancient, but made to look that way but with some modern shops and stalls scattered about. Personally I find this rather charming and enjoyable. Lets face it, you can't really create an authentic small ancient street",
          "A commercial street that sells food and souvenir. One of the photo spots charge \u00a510 for admission. Another one is in fact a hotel now. Only those pictures taking from the old street is free of charge.",
          "I read a lot of good reviews about this place. To my surprise, I found it disappointing when I visited. It have a lot of restaurants, street food stands, and gifts shops but nothing really stand out. The only I remember about the place is the stink smell coming from the",
          "This was indeed a very interesting street. A lot of historical building with urban shops and restaurants. pretty street arts and interesting walls. lot of chinese snacks in kiosks and also traditional chinese arts. Beware of the crowds. I also saw the traditional ear cleaning",

          "This is actually at least three (3) small street, parallel to each other, in a compact area just slightly west of Tianfu Square and very slightly northwest of People's Park (both of which you must also visit). They are similar to Jinli Street in that they are narrow, for",

          "This isn't authentic, it is crowded, and it is expensive. But there are also good bars, some decent food, and a fun night out.",
          "These few streets are little touristy gems. The old style architecture gives it a very unique feel in a large city rapidly developing. Lots of people but you're on holidays so taking time is what you do. We wandered around for just over an hour. It does have an almost upmarket",
          "I prefer Jinli street than this narrow and too crowded shopping street. And almost all eats and desserts are quite like the ones at Jinli Street. So just came here to have a quick look and tasted some of the snacks. Watch out for the infamous San Da Pao, its like mochi",
          "Many people for sure. Worth to come here to see the buildings which preserve the old Mengchu style architecture. A lot of coffee shop, hawkers food and restaurant. I saw the American chinese chef Martin Yan went inside one of the restaurant for video shooting. Hire a guide,",
          "We had so much fun strolling in Kuanzhai alley as it consists of Wide Alley, Narrow Alley and Well Alley.Wide and Narrow Alley is one of Chengdu's historical and cultural reserves. Very crowded with tourists but you still have room to take photos. Yes, here you still can try",
          "Nice Alleys to stroll. There are 4 alleys with different era architectures. You can get the feel of the old time villages along the alley.",
          "The narrow & wide alleys have some interesting artwork. The tiny shops are not much different from anywhere else in China. Only worthwhile visiting if you haven't got much on.",
          "This is a very representative historic place at Chengdu. Very clean, though crowded, as in many scenic places in China. The restaurants worth a try, and the cost is fair in general. Hot-pot is highly recommended.",
          "full of shops and it's a good place to buy souvenirs. Wouldn't suggest dining here though there are quite a number of restaurants.",
          "Fun short little walk down a tourist trap of a shopping area. The Starbucks was well designed to look Chinese. Many of the building are either old or renovated to resemble an ancient look. Ok place to get touristy trinkets. No need to book a tour as its easy to access via",
          "This street is much better and more spacious than Jingli street. Same kind of situation with stalls selling all kinds of food and souvenirs. However this area has more restaurants and cafe type establishments than Jingli. I suggest going after sunset so that there's less people",
          "Really enjoyed walking through the Kuan, Zhai and the adjacent Well alley. The buildings were well preserved and the area was very lively with tea houses, shops, ear cleaning 'stalls', street performances. Look out for the bronze statues/wall panels with informative write ups",

          "Having visited few other valleys in China, including Beijing, i find this is a very nice place to visit. Can easily spend half or even one day here at leisure. Goods and food sold here are reasonably priced without having to bargain much and items are pretty unique. Many",
          "Renovated buildings with cute retail shops and restaurants. Like many tourist areas, packed with people but well worth the visit. Food stalls with everything from cotton candy, mango drinks, rabbit heads, squid sticks, tofu and more. Restaurants were a bit pricey for China.",
          "Similarly to Jinli, these are traditional alleyway streets. I did prefer these streets to Jinli but that is just a personal preferences. It's more of a courtyard-village alleyway. It has gone through relatively recent renovations so it does have a more clean feel than Jinli. It",
          "Just back from a visit to the street. Very orderly, clean and organized. This attraction can be reached by subway. This afternoon while I was there it was mainly locals and I could not pick out any foreigners from the crowd. Straight streets of shops on either side and at least",

          "This is a fun place with alleys for eating, shopping and enjoyment. The focus is local crafts where one purchases gifts to take home. Obviously, it is quite \"touristy\" and many shops selling identical goods. There are three alleys and many artistic walls. Goods are a little",
          "Enjoyed the restaurants, face changing performances, the street food and the souvenir shops. There's a subway station right at the entrance.",
          "Came here just to kill time, but had enjoyed the trip. We didn't buy anything but just walked down both streets, window & people watching. There are lots of shops & eating places. The streets were crowded as it was Saturday but many obnoxious people kept gawking at a black",
          "We have heard of many such ancient and touristy streets in China. Many of them turned out to be a disappointment due to the poor balance between preservation of heritage and commercialism. Thus I was sceptical when I found out about this ancient street. This was my 2nd",
          "The food is good.... All the rest is very tourist oriented So go if you hungry Very expensive to buy souvenir there Give it 40 min then leave",
          "This is a cultural heritage left from the Qing dynasty. Now it offers restaurants housed in the historical buildings from that period, and various art and souvenir shops. Only two long Main Streets. It takes only 20 minutes to just browse thru them. Always crowded. Definitely a",
          "I have this place a 4 instead of a 5 just because it's smaller and less exciting than Jin Li, but still a must see! I love the cultural atmosphere of the wide and narrow alleys, and a great place to just walk around in fascination from everything that you see. From unique",
          "the atmosphere was great, felt i was sent back to china in the traditional era. Tried a couple of the street food, even though some of them were a bit expensive but it was great! a couple of german restaurants that had nice interior and great customer service as well.",
          "Nothing exciting - a very bustling tourist area filled with expensive souvenir shops and restaurants. Spent 15minutes to walk the whole thing and left. Nothing to write home about unless this is your first time in china. Take a brief walk if you have absolutely nothing to do",
          "Shopping, restaurants, bars, art & Sichuan Opera all in 3 well kept alleys. We saw the opera here (more variety show than opera in western definition) as we didn't want to dedicate a whole evening to it. 45 mins was enough & required no booking in advance",
          "This street area is billed as a must see for tourists- it is pretty but like so many places such as this around the world it is a sterilized version of the local culture. I strongly suggest walking the back streets of Chengdu to visit the local markets. This area has gift shops",
          "Interesting place. Street where rich families of Chengdu used to live. Some are still occupied. But nothing breathtaking",
          "We didn't have much time to play tourist however, this area was full of history and was very convenient to where we were staying.",
          "Maybe there was an ancient street at some point, but nowadays its different stores, restaurants and souvenir shops. Looks cute but all buildings look new. It wont take you long to see all three streets. But go there only if you have free time and if you already visited all main",
          "nothing special. you can find it in every tourist cities in China with different street names. If you are coming to China first time maybe worth to visit it.",
          "Kuan Zhai street is the best to walk and you will find lots of restaurants as well street food. You can finish the walk in around 40-45 min walking slow and experience the few local designers selling there products.",
          "Highly recommended. They surely have some interesting stuffs for everyone of you. You can also get your local snacks at those shops just outside before you enter into the alleys. Interesting place for me and everyone should try go there for a feel of Chinese culture!",
          "I came here 3 times during Chengdu trip. The first time was at night, after coming back from JiuZhai Valley. The 2nd time was the next day (on day time) and the last one was on the last day of the trip. To these ancient Street like Kuanzhai, you should visit on day time and",
          "Nice atmosphere with old houses, shops, eateries and performers. Also have gardens and places to rest, though plenty of people so need to squeeze. Good connectivity to public transport and security good too.",
          "We were quite dissapointed with this Alley. Its food are all very pricy and not much souvenior is available. But if you walk right to the end of the alley. There is a part where you can see the actual life of Chengdu people. Things are much cheaper there. Its something like a",
          "This is similar to most old towns in China which means it's not real. Most architecture and buildings have been rebuilt recently. Kuanzhai is also known as wide and narrow alley. There are 3 parallel alleys. 90% of the area is occupied with souvenir shops, restaurants and",
          "We really enjoyed walking down the street and seeing all the sights. There are a lot of souvenirs on sale here and there's lots of snacks you can try. We saw a lot of tea houses and restaurants but we didn't try any. You can also get your ears cleaned which we didn't try, but",
          "if it's your first time in China you will probably love this place. The buildings are beautiful and there is many shops where you can buy all sort of things. For me personaly is not that exciting since I've seen a lot of this kind of street not only in Chengdu but also in",
          "The Wide and Narrow Alleys provide plenty of material for people-watching and photographing. The atmosphere is that of an old city street with vendors and stores lining both sides. I really enjoyed the photographs that are partly 3D on the street walls. There is historical",
          "Although its just 3 streets of shops, we felt its more cozy than jinli and has wider walkway than jinli. It is more shopperble and some shops accepts international credit cards. Recommend the \u4e00\u9488\u4e00\u7ebf hand embroidery handbags. And we bump into a small tibetian incense stalls which",
          "Good place to buy trinkets and gifts. Lots of nightlife and restaurants to enjoy. Saw a nice show with a dancer who could quickly switch masks . Also a really cool looking starbucks if you are into that .",
          "My 2nd time here, I love here very much because is very beautiful street, a lot of food, a lot of beautiful thing. You can look tradition, cultural, modern at the same time. Here is a lot of souvenir. Please come to visit.",
          "This is a must visit place when you are in Chengdu. It is touristy however the well preserved buildings of historical Chengdu are interesting to see. The place also serve many local delicacies and modern fares.",
          "This place is very well conserved and now turned in a tourist attraction. A must visit to see the culture of chengdu and china. There are food stalls, restaurants, tea houses, boutiques, gift shops, Chinese operas, antiques, etc. Easily 2 hrs and the place is clean.",
          "Went there with my family for a stroll. Was very impressed with the cleanness of the place. Surprising the prices for the items from street Hawkers in push cart are fixed. No bargaining. A lot of interesting food to try out. I tried the famed rabbit meat but found it too",
          "Kuan ZhaiXIangZI is a famous sightseeing in Chengdu. Many visitors came there and left a really good comment about it. With many restaurants and clubs here, if you are a traveler who likes beer and food, you will have much more there at night. Comparing to Kuan ZhaiXiangZi, I",
          "This place is a must see while in Chengdu although you will not find any Pandas here other than the plastic ones! Within this area you will find a great deal of food and souvenirs, all very authentic. There are also several venues for the Facing Changing Opera shows. This is",
          "Fantastic little wide and narrow lanes, with plenty of random shopping, food and tea houses. Can get very busy in some parts. Only two stops down from Tianfu Square train station.",
          "Every place in China that is attended to, cared for, kept in a proper state, is a tourist attraction. Like a Swiss tourist village. Chinese people come and look how nice a place can be if one pays some attention to beautification and decoration. That is all the attraction in",
          "This is my second time visit to Kuanzai Ancient street. It is easy accessable by taking subway line 4 drop off at Kuanzai Street station. Basically as it is one of the famous tourist spot so it will always crowded with people either local or foreigner. Shops available selling",
          "If you go in the evening it is more beautiful with the lights on, but expect a lot more people. It was fun to walk trough but after a while we got tired of people bumping into us all the time.",
          "Nice looking area but getting commercialized now, even a starbucks on the street :) interesting shops, and some traditional foods and treats worth seeing",
          "The place was very crowded since it was a saturday afternoon and the weather was perfect. Many interesting food and wares were on sale. It features plenty of everything, i.e local food, ancient products and tourist souveneirs. There was only 1 public toilet at the entrance.",
          "You can find some cute and reasonable gift at those panda souvenir stores. Clothing and gifts are overpriced. Walk over 3 more streets you can find some local restaurants If time is not an issue. Traffic can get worse during school hour around 8:30am and 4:30pm. Overall it's a",
          "Great place to sample street food and people watch. Quirky shops. Lots of places to sample tea. Very busy.",
          "These streets are touristy and commercialised. Everything looked pretty new to me and people seemed to be lapping that up.",
          "Reserve two hours or more for this spot. There are some ancient buildings, interesting architecture, coffee shops and bars, with a fusion of modern and cultural style.",
          "Great street for shopping and tea houses. Very crowded, but not a problem. Prices are ok, you can probably spend a few hours there",
          "There are a lot of restaurants, shops and kiosks. I had a hot-pot dinner which was very spicy. It is a very famous attraction so there was a lot of people.",
          "Fun place to visit! Go at night. You can easily get here using the metro. There are a lot of restaurants! The food isn't the best one i had in China so far but the location is nice!",
          "Great for getting little bits and bobs for the family/friends. Prices are reasonable. Lovely traditional buildings.",
          "I have spent here one evening looking for a place to have dinner. The biggest problem is that basically no restaurant accepts credit cards so you need to have a lot of cash with you. If you look for an European style restaurant after some days of Chinese restaurants I recommend",
          "The Alley (street) isn't that long but quite interesting. Spent a couple of hours exploring the shops, some new some older. Some of the original buildings are still standing. Quite a tourist attraction with many bus loads of visitors arriving throughout the day. Worth a look if",
          "Good one. Three busy alleys arranged in parallel order. You can buy souvenirs there and simply taste old China. Must see if you are in Chengdu!",
          "One of the \"must visit\" place if this is your first time to Chengdu. There are few restaurants, pubs & teahouse for you to choose, to sit down and chi chat with friends. There is one section whereby you can take some nice photos with the 3D walls.",
          "If u want somewhere relaxing to spend your afternoon, kuanzhai is a good choice. Although commercial and crowded with tourists, still good to find some interesting shops and bars to spend your day.",
          "This place is a proof to the fact that not all touristy place are necessarily bad. It is lively, colorful, interesting and full of action. Definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. Restaurants are expensive by comparison to other local joints.",
          "We very much enjoyed strolling around this beautifully restored old Chengdu pedestrian area, full of residents and visitors enjoying the Autumn Moon Festival. Filled with nice shops, restaurants and tea houses, it was a fun way to spend an afternoon.",
          "The wide&narrow lane. Originally from the Ming dynasty..half is old, other half is renovated to shops/restaurants. In ancient times a lot of soldiers came to this area, the narrow street for the normal soldiers (now only Chinese street food) and the wide lane for the horses &",
          "Cool place to walk around. Was easy to taxi over from Du Fu Cottage. The eateries seemed a bit overpriced, perhaps a bit touristy. Some good street food options.",
          "A lot of restaurants, bars, street vendors and different shops. If you even have no intention to buy anything, it's very nice to wonder around. You can easily spend 2 hours there just looking and taking pictures.",
          "Typical chinese pedestrian street , with tea houses, vendors selling Chinese souvenirs. A bit pricier than Jin Li pedestrian street. Very crowded on public holidays so best avoided on those days.",
          "Fun to walk through the alleys and look in the shops, Very crowded but still a good time. A lot of cool things in the walls to take photos with and of! Stop and have lunch or some tea and people watch!",
          "We enjoyed the trip to KZ Ancient Street very much. There were many interesting little shops selling souvenirs as well as cafes everywhere along the walking street. There was also a Starbucks with Chinese style architecture. Even if you are not a fan of shopping, this place is",
          "Experienced the local delicacies and culture at these streets. Got some nice little souvenirs for family and friends here as well.",
          "Good place to spend a couple of hours on souvenir shopping. Some stores are a bit pricey so bargain.",
          "I had first visited the Kuan Zhai Alley before going to the Jinli pedestrianised area the following day. Both are pedestrianised areas showcasing some old houses that had been restored or renovated, souvenir shops, food stalls, restaurants, performances. If you are at Kuan Zhai",
          "Too busy to the point you want to get out like now! - it's attractive but very very touristy! High end shopping - not cheap.",
          "A compact area with a very wide selection of restaurants and shops. Good for a stroll and there's something in every price class. It's doubtful that anything is more than a few years old, but it's built to mimic the older styles and it does look nice. If you're in the area",
          "We toured the street after the temple as they are adjacent. Mostly vendors selling the same stuff you see everywhere and lots of food booths, with exotic meats like Yak and then the duck, rabbit heads and other animal parts.",
          "We walked here from our hotel as it was only 10 mins away. We did enjoy ourselves, there's plenty of shops, bars and places to get food. It does feel a bit like Jinli's poorer cousin. It has much of the same type of shops and food, but it's just not as big. On the plus side",
          "In contrast to Jinli, Kuanzhai is a tastefully attractive ancient style street with some nice shops and restaurants, well suited to a pleasant walk before or after dinner in one of the many restaurants.",
          "A very cool place to site see, shop and eat! We visited with friends do had translation handy to ask questions and try to help talk down prices.... As it says the wide and narrow streets are full of history and culture... A must see",
          "Artsy crafty shops without the usual tourist rubbish. clearly this area has been developed to attract tourists and diners alike. Worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful old streets which showcase the traditional architecture in a modern setting. Beautiful place for a stroll in the early evening. Be warned that it is a tourist hot pot and as such the prices are a little higher than else where but certainly worth it!",
          "We didn't really appreciate the spot. So many people were there it was impossible to walk through in a regular pace. People pushing from every side and merchants praising their articles aggressively made for bad vibes of these alleys. I'm sure the alleys would have been nice,",
          "Lotsa Chengdu souvenirs available at great bargains! especially panda items! there are several shops where you can watch 'changing face' Sichuan opera. I paid 38 yuan for one show that lasted about 1 to 1.5 hours. You can also get your ears cleaned at stalls along the lanes but",
          "I prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street than here as it is smaller but more crowded with similar local shops and food. Easier to get here from train station by just 5 mins walk. Only good point than Jinli if you don't have enough time.",
          "Wide and Narrow Street is one of my favorite areas in Chengdu. I love walking the small alleys without having to worry about traffic, bikes, and scooters. The area is a major attraction and is almost always guaranteed to be filled with throngs of happy tourists taking pictures",
          "The whole place have been rebuilt and just kept in the old style. It is really too commercialized. Tides of people there even on weekdays. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to spend a quiet time. There are some old towns around Chengdu which I really appreciate!",
          "For gifts for the folks back home, is a nice place to go. There are many shops from cheaper items to some very expensive items so it will satisfy most any budget!",
          "We headed there for lunch after seeing the pandas. The taxi ride took forever. We chose a lovely courtyard and had simple Chinese lunch. The street can be so noisy but the courtyards are lovely and quiet. Make sure to have some Koeko (or similar) ice-cream. Tastes like in",
          "I've been here so many times. I used to work at a school right around the corner... Rainy days are the best because there's very little if any people out there. Usually it's so crowded and uncomfortable otherwise... They do have great food and the architecture does represent the",
          "First, I have to say we are not big shoppers. However, the street is worth the experience especially if you can find you way into a courtyard to escape the pushy crowds.",
          "The streets north of these were much more interesting and full of local restaurants and locals. This street was interesting because of all the Chinese tourists and gift shops.",
          "Such a lovely street to walk down in the evening, lots of Chinese street snacks on offer, lots of cheap souvenir stores, lots of restaurants and there's always something going on here. Very vibrant and don't be afraid to try new things. When I was here it started raining but it",
          "That is the question: Wide and Narrow St or Jinli Pedestrian St? If you have time, do both. If not, here's my take (after having visited both): Wide and Narrow is easy to get to by Chengdu Metro and a smaller in terms of overall area than Jinli. I thought Wide and Narrow St",
          "The wide and narrow alley has a lot to offer. From all the tea houses that you can also catch a Sichuan Opera show, to the tea house/pub to grab a bottomless tea or a pint of beer. Add all the souvenir shop to the mix, you got yourself a great way to spend an evening. There",
          "Great shops and restaurants, and food stalls - interesting souvenirs for sale, good quality things. Nicely kept, clean and tidy. Interesting art display aswell.",
          "If u like historic and ancient building, this is the place. There's one place name Chinese Art and Craft Living Museum which is newly opened. Love the craft there, those statues are just so beautiful .... feel calm and excited there",
          "This is an interesting example of the old Chengdu streets made touristy for today's market. Full of Chinese tourists. We were the only Europeans in sight. Lots of food places but all look touristy, worth a look but not something to worry about missing. There seems to be quite a",
          "Marginally more interesting than JinLi. Better, more authentic restaurants can be found on North Xi'an road, a ten minute walk northeast.",
          "The street is very nice but very expensive and extremely crowded. Wouldn't buy a thing there, but definitely nice experience. And the entire area is nice",
          "We have been here twice.- during the day and at night. The buildings are amazing. We went into one place for lunch. When you walk into the doorway there were trees growing and tables around the area. The menu was completely in Chinese but we chanced ordering from the pictures",
          "Another ancient street in Chengdu, which lacks behind Jinli street. No matter at which time of the day you come, there are always massive crowds. While the ambiance in general is very nice, this destroys the experience. The stores are nice and of upper price level. Don't come",
          "Touristy spot in Chengdu and crowded at night, but really fun to stroll around. Many souvenier stores, restaurants, bars and food stands. Traditional Chinese houses make out the atmosphere of this place. Many photo opportunities including the on streat ear treatment and crispy",
          "Another interesting place to visit in the area. Bustling ancient street market, old buildings in true ancient Chinese style",
          "An amazing street with several old buildings Definitely bargain for prices here. Start with half the price and they will probably come down a significant amount. There is an amazing tea house you should visit here just to see it. It's very traditionally made such as several",
          "We received directions to this street but were almost lost. Unfortunately Chinese people could not explain how to get there due to language problems. We visited on a saturday night in the Chinese holiday season and it was crowded. After a while we noticed that wre were on a",
          "Very nice area to eat and go out in the evening. A lot of very stylish bars and many restaurants with many choices what to eat.",
          "The place was packed on a saturday but very lively with interesting shops, found a bar on the \"narrow\" lane which made for a nice respite.",
          "This is one of those old/ renovated street complexes,, a tourist magnet, which is to be enjoyed with your ears and eyes.The architecture of the houses lining the streets is something for history buffs. The stores are as usual touristy, mostly for domestic consumption",
          "This is a great place to find the souvenirs you need to take with you. Many shops and stalls, plus good dining facilities for local food/. Worth the trip.",
          "We re so happy to come to this place...yes it is crowded but you cant buy the atmosphere and the ambience of the this vicinity.... The shop sells range from traditional chinese foods to silverware and jewelry. The safety was ok as we saw a lot of police present in the area.",
          "There are a lot of stalls and food vendors selling food and products there. Great to wonder round at night time. Things close up at about 10pm, with a few bars staying open.",
          "If you are familiar with China, I am not sure of the value-added. But if not, then it is on the metro-line and it does offer traditional 19th century architecture (60% authentic, 40% reconstructed in the same style). Souvenir shops, tea houses and street food vie for",
          "Do go earlier if you want to take noce photographs of the place. May take 2 hours or more to really walk through the lanes. Good for buying little souvenirs and wating local snacks",
          "Visited on a rainy weekday eve but was still enjoyable. Lots of quirky little shops mainly selling touristy items, lots of street foods and restaurants. A good place to have a walk around and easy to get to as close to the metro.",
          "nice tourist spot with street food and very good hotpot! I like narrow street more than wide street and is worth visiting at night!",
          "The things in this street are slightly pricey as it's a popular tourist area but you could find great food and really nice hotpots in the area with nice decorations, it's a place worth visiting and especially at night it can look pretty different from when visiting in the",
          "I know, I know, it's newly built and not authentic - but it's a great fun place to visit after you paid cultural dues to those authentic sightseeing places and need panda souvenirs, tea, delicious street food and entertainment! We loved streets wide and narrow, it's a belly and",
          "This is another make-over traditional looking pedestrian street. Like many others in Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities, it offers traditional snacks, some live performance of how the food is cooked. If you have a few hours to kill, this is a place to hang around to soak",
          "Historical homes are now shops and tea rooms. Again, little difficult in the rest room category for Western visitors. Practice those squats, ladies!",
          "Having been called as the namecard of Chengdu by many tourists, Kuanzhai Alley( Broad&Narrow Street) has attacted many new traveller's attention. With three alleies lying paralleledly, each one has its own uniqueness. As a local girl and guide, i think the reason why Kuanzhai",
          "These streets are great for people watching, shopping, eating and just browsing. There are shops for every pocketbook and interest. Walking through this area is a must for any visitor to Chengdu.",
          "Our guide Cecilia brought us to this street and WOW it is amazing totally loved this, lots of character and lots of very talented people. We love going where the locals hang out! Lots of variety here, from handmade cavings and sugar art, to hot pots, tea shops and great silk",
          "The Wide and Narrow streets are worth a visit, lots of restaurants, can be busy but pleasant to walk around",
          "Was nice wandering through the 2 alleys. Especially enjoyed the hot, fresh snacks which were all 10 yuan. Try the spicy silken tofu - it was popular food good reason. Also the hot pineapple rice.",
          "This is a fun touristy area with lots of folks walking around in the evenings. There is a lot of shopping and there are several restaurants. There were some street performers, and the bars had a lot of performers too.",
          "During our private tour with Aline we stopped on the way back to our hotel on the Wide and Narrow Street. This is a shopping and street food area that is fun to visit and shop. We did actually find a couple of souvenirs as gifts for family at home here. Very interesting area,",
          "We thought it would just be another commercial street selling the same souvenir all over the street. It was so not that! The buildings are refreshingly Chinese and the merchandise is top notch. We also had the best dandan noodle in one of the restaurants. Would have stayed",
          "a little bit of chinese history, nice shops, good restaurants, old tradition meets modern tourism . . . it is a really nice place to visit especially in the evening, when the lights go on and everything is colorful, the heat of the day slowly ceases and you enjoy sinchuan with",
          "It has nice architecture and a nice atmosphere (I went during daytime), so it's great for window shoppers. However, the items are overpriced. It's still worth a visit if you enjoy casually walking and looking at random things!",
          "Really great place to try some great food, souvenirs, and plenty of interesting things to see! Really would recommend, day or night. The way to the dragon is a great hot pot dinner with Sichuan opera on Saturday nights. A great show and meal! Definitely try to visit",
          "Quite a nice and clean place (for China standards), lots of street food and tea houses around but other than that the shops didn't appeal to me. You can probably go there to take some photos. The place was smaller than expected.",
          "Yes, it's a bit touristy, but it also is very domestic, i.e., filled with locals. Just a wonderful place to wander aimlessly, chose a restaurant or street food, watch people, and enjoy the hot evenings. Highly recommend allowing a couple of hours to just experience the",
          "A crowded place that full of different street food and some Sichuan style tea houses. The streets are not wide and keep those old architectural objects or style. Perhaps, a bit too crowded but it's the way that attracts people and tourists. However, it stills a nice place to",
          "A great place for tourists who like markets and interesting different things to look at. Lots of local food to try, but also extremely crowded when we were there. All part of the genuine China experience.",
          "With so much restoration these \"ancient\" streets all looked the same to me. Their original identity is lost and replaced with an idealised version of an old street. Having said that, I would recommend seeing one ancient street during a trip to Chengdu. I thought Jinli Street",
          "This is quite similar to Jinli pedestrian street but without the gardens and pond. There are plenty of restaurants and shops selling souvenirs. Tea houses are everywhere but you can also find Starbucks and some local coffe cafes. The teahouse close to the exit by the main road",
          "My sister and I stayed at a hotel close by Kuanzhai last November so we went through the streets several times during our 4 day stay. The experience you have willl differ depending on how busy the area is. We had tea in the area on a Sunday afternoon and there were tons of",
          "Though it's going to be touristy no matter when you go, this is a nice area to walk through. Recommend it for families with kids, and it is fine for strollers. We enjoyed stopping in kiosks for snacks along the way--yogurt at one place, tofu in another, small savory dishes--and",
          "A tourist area that has been recreated to resemble what the architecture may have looked like at the time, but it is then populated by tourist trap restaurants and shops. A lot of tourists (but I was there on the weekend to be fair), but as an experience it wasn't all that fun",
          "Crowded and touristy (mostly in-country tourists)- but there are some architectural gems like old courtyard houses. There are also many food stalls and vendors selling local street food as well as ear-digging services (yes!) - all that creates a noisy festive kind of atmosphere",
          "This is a very crowded pedestrian street, with lots of small shops selling trinkets and food. A nice place to walk and eat tidbits, if it wasn't so crowded",
          "We went to the Wide and Narrow Streets on a Wednesday night and didn't find it too crowded. There are lots of shops and you could spend quite a while browsing all different types of items! There is a stand where a man will paint your name and a poem in Chinese, and there are all",

          "I expected more, I wasn't overly impressed. The crowd makes the whole trip off putting. I've gotten quite used to the shuffling mentality in Chengdu, but it doesn't make you feel relax! Best to walk alongside the outer corners of Kuanzhai, where you will see less people. I",
          "When you decide to come over during the weekends, be prepared for the mass of people you will encounter. This won't be an easy stroll, more like a shuffle train! Don't bother coming here if you can't stand masses of people pushing elbow to elbow. You'll be better off going to",

          "We came on a Sunday and it was really crowded - too crowded to be enjoyable. The area also seems very commercial. If you can, get out of Chengdu and visit an old town instead. We also visited Huanglongxi Ancient Town and it was much more enjoyable. We walked through this",
          "Another great place to visit in chengdu. One of the older parts of the city. Went and saw a show totally enjoyed this area . Like most of the old parts of chengdu it is full of gifts to buy and food to eat. History that you can't find anywhere else. Im definitely going back",

There was an old Chinese proverb \u201cDonot enter Sichuan in youth (\u5c11\u4e0d\u5165\u5ddd)\" describing that the life style of Chengdu will make you enjoy life more rather than work your butt off. With that being said,",

It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery.

However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou\u2014both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways\u2014on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development.

Built in 1911 as Shaocheng Park (\u5c11\u57ce\u516c\u56ed), it is the first public park in the city. The Railway Protection Movement Monument in the park is designated a Major Historical and Cultural Site of China.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nPeople's Park is located on Shaocheng Road in central Chengdu, near Tianfu Square. Covering an area of 112,639 square metres (1,212,440 sq ft), it is the largest green area in downtown Chengdu. The park features an artificial lake, several gardens, the Railway Protection Movement Monument, and the century-old Heming Teahouse (\u9e64\u9e23\u8336\u9986), a local landmark.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park is located in the former Shaocheng (\"small city\"), which was built by the Qing dynasty as the garrison for the Manchu and Mongol soldiers from the Eight Banners. In 1911, Yu Kun (\u7389\u6606), the last Qing general in Chengdu, converted part of Shaocheng into the city's first public park, known as Shaocheng Park.In 1911, the Railway Protection Movement erupted in Sichuan, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and replaced it with the Republic of China. From 1913\u201314, the new republican government built the Monument to the Martyrs of the Railway Protection Movement (\u8f9b\u4ea5\u79cb\u4fdd\u8def\u6b7b\u4e8b\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891) in the park, which is now a Major Historical and Cultural Site of China.The park was enlarged in 1914. In 1924, Governor Yang Sen appointed prominent businessman Lu Zuofu (\u5362\u4f5c\u5b5a) to be the education minister of Sichuan. Lu made many improvements to the park, building museums, a library, a zoo, and sports facilities.During the Second Sino-Japanese War, a bronze statue of General Wang Mingzhang of the Sichuan Army was erected in the park, after Wang was killed in the Battle of Xuzhou. On 27 September 1940 and 27 July 1941, Shaocheng Park was twice bombed by Japanese warplanes, which destroyed many facilities and caused thousands of casualties, although the Railway Protection Monument survived.After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the new Communist government renamed the park as People's Park in 1950. The park was enlarged, refurbished, and reopened in October 1952, but the Wang Mingzhang statue was demolished.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe park has its own station, People's Park Station, on Line 2 of the Chengdu Metro. It is also served by bus lines 5, 13, and 37.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "not that impressive ... get cheap beer as way too many fake (and expensive) wines and liquors. use your own judgement",
          "While this is one of these touristy shopping alleys that you find in major Chinese cities, I found this one quite well done. It has an interesting mix of traditional local snacks, souvenirs, Chinese furniture, clothing,... it also has a few \u201chigher end\u201d pretty stores and cafe",
          "This place is the usual street alley like what you can find in other China cities. Lots of local street food and handicrafts for you to spend your monies. Getting here is super easy since there is a subway station name after it under Line1.",
          "It rained throughout our stay, which made Kuanzhai alley hard to negotiate. Plenty of food outlets, curio shops, a little too touristy and crowded for our liking, but it may appeal to some people.",
          "Nice and interesting place to visit, with great admiration for the preservation of the old houses, with new modern interior architecture for some of the shops. Lots of things to buy and eat but prices on the high side, considering this is a tourist-bound destination.",
          "Visit there in December which is a frezzing season. A clean and nice shopping street which is for tourism and the price is not that cheap. Just take a walk, try some street foods and enjoy the ambience. Overall nice shoppin street.",
          "Go if you've few hours to spare. Easy access by subway. Can eat local snacks and foods with culture performance. Personally feel safe here as there are police are patrolling and tourist information. counter. Price are more touristy.",
          "We visited Chengdu as part of a tour. Our guide told us about the Wide and Narrow Alley history before we visited. Interesting mix of shops and restaurants, we had a quick lunch and a chance to try authentic Sichuan cuisine. It was interesting to watch the people as well.",
          "We really enjoyed our guided walk around these alleyways and saw lots of interesting shops, food places and just generally interesting things. As like most of the places we visited, very few Western tourists which made us a target for photos and selfies with the locals.",
          "nice shipping, very cultural setup. It appears a walk through time. nice food locations. A lot of nick knack shopping.",
          "Very crowded, but very interesting ancient streets with street food, tea shops and silversmiths. Treat yourself with an authentic, handmade (in front of you) silver piece and enjoy the noise!",
          "This is a super touristy place full of \"silver\" shops and other food that we saw everywhere else - its so crowded we couldn't walk and really wanted to get out of there - if this is your first time in China check it out - otherwise, you can pass.. you have seen this before..",
          "Located just opposite Kuanzhai train station. We really enjoyed visiting and trying the food. We would recommend this but glad we didn\u2019t take the kids.",
          "Allocate a couple of hours to wander this area. Great example of \u201colder times\u201d. Small alleys with lots of shops and eating options. Also here is the face changing opera if you want it. Highly recommended.",
          "Love the architecture of the ancient buildings and the photo ops beside sculptures and especially some of the exterior-wall painting. Lots of Chinese street food options, including roasted pig ear, noses, scorpions and many other exotic delicacies. Lots of souvenir and other",
          "It was lovely time when we went there as it was not as hot and you have time to explore more. Price is ok for things food is good there are few famous sichuan restaurant that suit my taste bud. As the small shops one scare the hell of me for their hygiene wise and ambience. So",
          "A place not to miss if you visit Chengdu. Lots of great shopping and food . It can be quite crowded, especially in the evening so try an ego early.",
          "Too crowded. Food is good, though. You can find authentic Sichuan spicy food and they have very cute papapig cotton candy for sale. You must get one of them if you have kids.",
          "Nice historical area with lots of shops, cafes and restaurants. Very busy with lots of tourists but still very interesting to visit.",
          "I guess it\u2019s a typical tourist trap that is overly crowded and this month with the heat and rainy season does not help to the whole experience",
          "This area has shops and food, it gets very busy on the main alleys but is a fun place to walk around, there are a bunch of places tucked away in between!",
          "Shopping street as others in the China. Many restaurants, bars, street food, souvenirs. Very crowded",
          "The most interesting is the old-fashioned houses, although they are newly built. The shopping atmosphere is crowded and touristic. In fact, you see much. But I did not want to buy anything. It is just to old-China-styled-artificial. Good to visit, but all is too much over the",
          "Excellent renovation work all buildings are amazing you get a feeling of Chinese Architecture. Good choice for a long walk if you want to take pics, try local street food drink tea and buy local delicacies . Once you have entered one souvenir store \u201e you have seen all of them",
          "Although most visitors may be tourist, most don\u2019t know that the area is very historical architecturally. The houses there are the original ancient homes of that area. The owners updated them to be for commercial purposes which turned them into the present day attractions. I went",
          "Well this is a popular place among tourists (mostly from other parts of Sichuan as the Chengdu locals do not shop here). Pleasant enough with a wide range of shops, and good for a few photos if you can keep the crowds out of your photos. Reasonably close to metro station, and",
          "I guess this is the place to go if you want to buy trinkets. By the time I got here I was shopped out, but there were other sights to see worth the look.",
          "Enjoy the traditional and architecture buildings and some local snacks along the three streets at the Alley..",
          "Not worth the time spent getting there, nothing different to many similar places in China with expensive snacks and overpriced tat",
          "Some interesting shops and weird \u201csnacks\u201d (rabbit heads????) but ultimately very commercial Beautiful brown sugar animal creations. Get made up as a Chinese opera star.",
          "This is an upscale version of Jinlin Street area, with bigger shops and better restaurants and it\u2019s much less crowded. It\u2019s busy day and night and always seemed quite safe to us. There\u2019s a lot of street food and ice cream stands as well as high end tea and antique shops.",
          "My teen daughters and I walked here from our hotel and had a great time wandering the alley, enjoying the beauty and architecture of the area. We saw many in large garb walking around. We were there on a Sunday and honestly it was not too crowded. The restaurants all look really",
          "Amazing and wonderful stuff from souvenirs to traditional opera dance to great food.. New hype cafes selling traditional to modern food.. So tempting and u need at least 3 hours to try almost different stuff. A must for locals and foreigners.",
          "The Alleys are very close to People's Park in the centre of the city, and are full of charm and character. Lots of small businesses and restaurants selling their wares and services here with all of the commotion and sounds and smells you would expect from traditional Chinese",
          "We came here twice because we enjoyed it so much. There is a good variety of food on offer and it was not as crowded and overwhelming as Jilin walking street. Highly recommended for some shopping and eating. We also did a tea tasting at one shop. As is the case in most of China,",
          "There are many interesting structures, shops and eateries in the Kuanzhai Alley pedestrian area. We tried some of the street foods, but without being too adventurous. There are many beautiful and unique photo ops throughout the area. It is a sightseer\u2019s haven. It is a good place",
          "Nice and charming alley where the old meets the new. Boutiques, snack shops, restaurants, tea houses, sport bars, art galleries, you can find all kinds of establishments in this unique neighbourhood. It's easy to get to the Alley by public transportation, which has contributed",
          "Lovely narrow streets with lots of shops and places to eat. Relaxed place, no one is giving you the hard sell, a real pleasure to walk around, give yourself a couple of hours to really soak it up",
          "Half authentic, half new, it was a nice place to stroll around. Some things are a surprise to see, then there are things you'd expect at a Chinese alley. Just go with it! We had some lovely little potatoes- eat them with a toothpick, they were a little spicy, but very nice!",
          "Restored alleys with shops and food. LOTS of people. Nothing really special to see, eat, or buy. I wouldn't describe it as \"authentic\" at all. We did stop in to see a show (it was the first such place on the left hand side as you're entering the alley, located on the 2nd floor",
          "A nice place to visit after coming back from the Pandas. Narrow alleyway full of souvenirs, street food, restaurants. A great mix of cultures. Worth a wander Has its own subway so easy to find.",
          "I have visited the place several times. I still remains interesting because each time one could see somewhat different things and people. Quite a crowded place. It has many different kinds of shop, some nostalgic and some modern. Plenty of Sichuan food to choose from and prices",
          "This place has a rich history and hence it is full of visitors even during wkdays. It has alot of souvenior shops, pubs and snack counters. There are decorations on the walls which depics the ancient story. Interesting place.",
          "The area has changed in recent years. It is no longer a collection of really up-market restaurants, and today houses many moderate low cost local eateries. Several Sichuan face changing shows which may be worth a visit.",
          "Walked here at the suggestion of one of the folks at our hotel. A really eclectic mix of traditional architecture, galleries, shops, bars and restaurants....while it is busy, at least you don\u2019t have to dodge mopeds.",
          "Wonderful to see so many different ways of expose the Chinese culture. We have a nice time walking and appreciating many stores, restaurants, Te houses, etc.",
          "Used to be a great place to visit. Now is a touristy place with low taste. Lost all its characteristics.",
          "I visited here with my friends. There are 3 streets and a lot of shops. The buildings were unexpectedly built recently, though they look like old town. I recommend you will try XiaoChi in this area. These are cheap and delicious. If you\u2019re looking for some souvenirs, you",
          "Spend some time there if you are new to Chengdu. There are lots of restaurants and small eateries to try out local delicacies. There also are interesting shops that make the trip enjoyable. Make sure to take a walk in the different alleys, they lead to different parts of the",
          "These alleyways are perfect for those looking for a gift to take home. Rebuilt in the late 1990s -2000s the shops offer a variety of local crafts and food. A hint to the visitor, use the bathroom before visiting here as the \u2018facilities\u2019 are not great.",
          "Its a good place to shop after day tour, Variety street food with reasonable price, even local people come here fir dinner. My favorite shop here is Panda House which sells panda poducts with a good design.",
          "Standard mix of funky souvenir shops, tea shops, art displays, etc. Very cute, \"cultural\" architecture, but obviously a bit tourist-y. There is a Starbucks, after all. It was fun to wander & pop in the shops, and there was decent coffee to be had. Bar-wise, though, the next",
          "I loved the alleys in downtown Chengdu, both Kuanzhai and the parallel streets, they have unique street sculptures, nice tea houses, Chinese \"Xiao Chi\" (small bites) and fancy restaurants to please the most picky of tourists. A real delight not to miss while in Chengdu.",
          "Really nice spot. Popular with locals & tourists alike so probably better to visit on a weekday. I go every time we come back to Chengdu.",
          "Excellent experience soaking in the architecture and ambience, with shops peddling traditional crafts and foods. Highly recommended to visit. Go early to avoid the crowds, especially on weekends.",
          "Replica street made of old times. It\u2019s nice to see. It takes an hour or two to see everything. Mostly tea houses or shops that sell panda items.",
          "Very pretty streets, since we where there in mid December and it was quite cold, there were not too many people, but I suppose this area gets crowded during high season. Nevertheless it's very pretty, lots of nice doors and good food too. Definitely recommend spending a few",
          "I was full of excitement before visiting the KuanZhai alley thinking that this might be an authentic looking streets from the past. However, the modern looking shops spoil the authenticity of these 2 alley. Just an hour is enough if you only want to walk down these 2 alleys.",
          "Must see place for first time visit in chengdu. Historical buildings with modern shopping concept. Many local street food and art displays. Easily accessible by local Metro service.",
          "Love this place. Very well thought out preservation project turning it into a very touristic place, and a highly successful one too. The concept and architectural planning, commercial fit-outs of the entire place makes one feel like stepping back in time, 300+ years ago into the",
          "Good historic walk thru the wide and narrow alleys of chengdu. Many things to see. Many artists show their skills here. Candy designs can be made in front of you, colorful cotton candy, paper cuts, even dog poop candy.",
          "Just two parallel streets but very colorful and live area. Impressive buildings housing galleries, shops and restaurants. Great place to visit.",
          "This place is quite similar to Jinli Street, full of shops and restaurants. But I find some of the shops here are more well decorated compare to Jinji Street. I enjoyed the Chinese architecture buildings and decorations and took many pictures. No entry fee is required. It is",
          "more expensive than other sites for street food but clean and delicious. also a good place for souvenirs.",
          "I like Jingli lane more, this alley has many nice shops and restraurants but they are expensive than other place in Chengdu, probably because it's too famous and popular. Unless you like to enjoy the wine here in the bars and watch the traditional opera trick called \"change",
          "These are a reconstruction of the old city market alleys - the wide and the narrow streets. They are filled with shops and people, lots of people. It's more touristy but worth a visit.",
          "Lots of tea shops and food stalls / restaurants to explore, and to give visitors a taste of Chengdu culture. If you want the same experience without the crowds (and maybe more authentic), try visiting Kuixinglou Street, a few streets to the North.",
          "Pretty good place for shopping and eating. Many tourists and thus rather packed. Teahouses are plenty and they are a nice place to sit down and rest for a while.",
          "I was very impressed with the Kuanzhai Alley and other surrounding areas. What a wonderful place for tourists - teeming with people but organised chaos, this place has some of the most beautiful shops and lots of fabulous restaurants which provide entertainment including the",
          "Three lanes full of shops, restaurants, snack stalls and Chinese people. So crowded it is difficult to walk especially in the evening",
          "If you like hiking this is the place to be with lots of greenery and flowers.However there is nothing much here",
          "This famous tourist area is also known as Wide & Narrow Alleys. There are three parallel ancient city alleys, named Wide, Well and Narrow as well as numerous courtyards along them. They are popular for tourists as you can see in the photo\u2019s; where there are restaurants, pubs,",
          "Cool but touristy! Lots to eat, lots to look at and lots of people. But fun we came back twice. And ate here twice! Better to come in the evening less people. Starts to get much quieter around 9-930 but will close around 10",
          "1. U can enjoy variety of foods here, rabbits meat, stinky taufu etc.. 2. Combination of few streets. 3. Place for photographs 4. Metro station just in front of the KuanZhai Alley.",
          "Beautiful alleys, shops, nice food, buildings with full of art, very interesting, must do while you are in Chengdu",
          "Kuan and Zhai Alley will provide you with a fusion of modern lifestyle and traditional Chines culture, food and tea house opera. There are plenty of shops to do shopping from traditional handicrafts, spices to silk and modern apparels. Evening would be preferred to visit",
          "A modern twist to the alley way, plenty of shops to look at, snacks, bars, restaurants etc. Clean and convenient to get to to, with its own metro station.",
          "Cultural and historical place with rows of street food including rabbit meat, gosh! Culture Shocckkk!!!",
          "We really enjoyed our day exploring through this part of town. There\u2019s lots to see and eat. Particularly enjoyed the pastry shop. Worth a visit.",
          "The alleyways are quite touristy and commercialised but still good to just wander about,from narrow one to wide one,nice street food",
          "Mostly restored or recreated. It\u2019s a fun destination to visit for local snacks, food, souvenirs etc. We went there in the evening & decided it was worth a second visit during the day. You can easily spend 3 hours there including a break for either lunch, afternoon tea or dinner.",
          "The usual commercialisation of a Chinese heritage area. Traditional architectures mixed in with many restaurants and cafes serving up a variety of cuisines. Weekends are super crowded as usual but you can find a nice place to watch the people walking pass and enjoy a cuppa.",
          "Very well appointed for city tourism. You will feel like walking in the past with lots of historical old building although they are turned it into something else now. You still can see some are kept like it was and well preserved.",
          "I see from comments below that people visiting during the day found the alley too crowded and hectic. We went on a Sunday evening (about 9pm), and we didn't have that problem at all. There were still enough people in the alley to give it atmosphere, but it still felt very calm",
          "I went on a Saturday and it was so crowed and chaotic that I wasnt able to enjoy it. A bit too commercial for me. Recommend Jinlin street instead.",
          "I enjoyed my 1-2 hours here. It is a pleasant place to have a wander around. There are a number of places where you can try different types of Sichuan food. The Wren Restaurant (pictured) was a convenient (although a bit more expensive) way of trying different Sichuan cuisine",
          "There were so many people - domestic and foreignt tourists visiting the 2 alleys. Best to visit in the morning, where there are lesser crowds, so that we you can better appreicate the alley ways and architecture. We visited in July, and in the afternoon, the weather became too",
          "Beautiful area to wander around. More boutique type shops, interesting. Lots of food options, but Western prices.",
          "Yep just like its description Kuanzhai Alley, is a warren of shops in varying sized alleys. We enjoyed wondering around and seeing all sorts of different souvenirs and food. We did prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street for its atmosphere though...",
          "We went here because we heard there was a traditional hot pot restaurant that also had the face changing opera as entertainment. We really enjoyed the traditional Sichuan hotpot and the face changing opera was a real highlight and something that the whole family will not",
          "If you're looking for crowds and overpriced shopping, this is the place for you. This is a popular place for domestic tourists, and the day we were there it was so crowded we couldn't wait to get through it and on to something more relaxing.",
          "this is a very popular destination for a lot of foreigners as well as out of town visitors from other parts of China or Asia. I can't see the attration, unless you've never seen one before. I would say it's ok for a first visit, just to say been there done that. The area is",
          "Prefer Jinli because more picturesque- but if u have time for both, would recommend. Some of the shops are same branch on both streets. Pedestrian only street lined with shops selling local foods, handicrafts and anything else imaginable. Great way to immerse in the food culture",
          "Strolling along the customs & tradition of the locals, a must to visit. The scent of the spicy Szechuan cuisine, its famous chilly & pepper, the traditional stone grinding of red chilly mix with garlic,typical courtyard of the dynasty bordering this stone walking alley makes",
          "This is a good area to wander around for a few hours. Good for street food and souvenirs. There are also great restaurants here which have live Sichuan opera and dance shows.",
          "The narrow and wide alleys (there are three of them in the same area) are great to spend a couple of hours wandering through imagining how it used to be in decades gone by. They tried to keep them as authentic as possible while they serve a modern purpose - shopping, eating,",
          "Touristy but wonderful markets, such a variety of shops and things to eat. You can sit in on a play for a small fee also. We ventured less than 50m from here and found a very local Chinese market",
          "This was a lot like several other pedestrian zones we've visited on our trip. It had a lot of clothing and souvenir shops, many open to bargaining. There were also many places that sold Sichuan peppercorns, peppers, & hot pot concentrate. The street food looked really good, but",
          "Lovely place with a lot of history. Here you can clean your ears, in the old traditional way, for about 60 yuan. Nice restaurants and bars and a lot to see. Crowded place, but very nice.",
          "Yes, it is terribly crowded as are all tourist areas in China. But the ancient architecture, shops, and restaurants offer something for everyone. Lots of Sichuan snacks and restaurants, but also pubs featuring pizza and western food. Touristy \"face changing\" and Chinese opera",
          "Many food, drinks, restaurants, history, shops, souvenirs items and they have a lot to offer. Was great to visit from afternoon till evening",
          "You can wander through the alleys (there are several in this network) to find food, ice cream, souvenirs, and crafts. We found a really pretty handmade silver filigree jewelry store that was stunning. This shop is tucked away in an enclave of other shops, and not visible from",
          "It\u2019s made for tourist and the whole place is usually flooded by tourist from other cities in China. Sometimes locals do venture there for tea as well. If you are visiting Chengdu, might as well come and visit the streets and window shop. No need to buy any of the exorbitantly",
          "I have been to Chengdu three times. The alley is always on my list. Many good tea houses to share with friends.",
          "I went because this was one of the go-to places in Chengdu, and my family was on a group tour. The experience was marred by the holiday crowd (I went on the eve of a long 3 day public holiday), which made it difficult to move, much less enjoy the surroundings. Many parts of the",
          "Lots of places to stop and shop or to stop and eat. God people watching, too. A great diversion in the city. Also within a very short walk to People's Park.",
          "Its a short street with many shops for tourists. Because we were on a hot noon, we didn't do much except walking through the street. We did stopped for lunch. The shop was busy, but the food was a disappointment.",
          "Old street full of restaurants, cafes/tea houses and shops selling souvenirs. Went there at night and it was crowded. Love the ambience.",
          "Lots of interesting things to see and taste. We spent about a hour walking around after dinner. It does get crowded but very civil people. It is vey clean considering the crowds.",
          "Known as Wide and Narrow Alleys, these pedestrian streets have street performers, shopping, and restaurants. It\u2019s a colorful scene and very crowded. Plan on 2-3 hours.",
          "We went to JinLi street during our last Chengdu trip last year and didnt get a chance to come to KuanZhai alley, so we made up for it this trip. well, if you are expecting something similar to JinLI street, ie tonnes of street side food to sample and crowds, then you are wrong.",
          "So much to see and do, shops of every variety, a great many nationalities. Noisy and bustling it was great. Take some time to stop and look, there is a lot to see. Plenty of places for food and drink, and you can even get your ears cleaned (a local speciality). As I am a",
          "This place is as good as it gets if you're a foodie and willing to explore all the different food that is available. Everything my wife and I tried was AWESOME. Lots of great desert type stuff as well.",
          "Cool alleyway with some interesting shops. Lots of tourist shops and panda items everywhere! Plenty of yummy smelling food too.",
          "A restored street built in the style of original architecture. A great place to wander and munch in the food stalls.",
          "We had heard rave reviews about this place, and on arrival we were not disappointed. It looks amazing, and is great to spend an hour or so threading your way through thousands and thousands of other tourists. Some amazing shops and food. The reason for the three stars is that",
          "This is, as may be expected, a commercialised area. Nevertheless, it is worth a visit for the various shops, the wall murals, and probably the teahouses which offer traditional tea in opera houses. For the latter, I suspect that it is better than that at Shufengyayun; they are",
          "Kuanzhai Alley is a historical look alley with lots of shopping and restaurants. There are many for stores for local snack like spiced rabbit head, spiced pig brain...kuanzhau Alley is more interesting than Jinli Street, it is bigger in size and with more options on food. Many",
          "It is interesting to walk around in this pedestrian area. The designed concept is nice and rather attractive with a bit of history. though rather commercialized with all the shops for all kinds of contemporary merchandise.",
          "A few walking streets (wide and narrow, per the name) full of shops and restaurants. Despite some of the signage, there is nothing ancient about it, but there are a lot of options (and tourists).",
          "As written in the title, you'll probably end up here if you go to Chengdu. It's flooded with tourists and local chinese, walking around and lining up for restaurants, coffee shops and mahjong establishments nearby. It's modern, but feels very pleasant and cultural too.",
          "The place full of all kinds of building, you could stroll around watch a traditional Chinese show, including the famous change face mask in less a second right on front of you. All kinds of street foods, all kinds of restaurant. You could drink coffee or tea, relaxing and",
          "Jinli and the wide and narrow alleys are the southern China version of the BeiJing Hutongs, and although these places to me don\u2019t have a really authentic feel about them, I think they are worth a visit... well at least one of them, the question is which one? I\u2019ve been several",
          "Though this is a tourist trap, it's a fun one. Visiting on a Saturday afternoon, the alleys were full of people, though this made for entertaining people-watching. The area is clean for the amount of traffic seen there. The shop buildings are well-restored.",
          "We spent one evening wandering these streets and had a great time. We would have liked more time here but were sadly leaving Chengdu the following day. These alleys are packed full of shops, tea shops, bakeries, restaurants and bars. It was very busy though when we were there",
          "This is a good place to see a cleaned up version of a traditional Chinese shopping/tea house area but don\u2019t go at peak times. I walked through here on a Saturday afternoon on my way back from the Yongling museum and these \u201calleys\u201d were so packed that you could hardly walk.",
          "We spent a wonderful couple of hours walking around this renovated Hutong area. there are a vast number of eating establishments and restaurants to choose from and a good time will be had.",
          "Very interesting area to spend a warm afternoon. Lots of small, but clean shop with friendly owners who don\u2019t pressure with high pitched sales. Recommend Dan Dan noodles at one of the noodle houses. Yummy.",
          "Ancient street, neat, clean and will very crowded if holidays season due to the street is narrow. A lot of local delicacies street foods and Chinese opera face changing show in this street.",
          "Just another pair of Qing-style (emphasis on the word style) streets for busloads of Chinese tourists to walk on for last-minute panda stuffed toys and quick 10 RMB bites (emphasis, too, on the word busloads, because if you stop for even a quick photo someone will start shouting",
          "the streets has so much to offer! basically everything u need from touristic stuff to local food or some real hot spicy food,you name it. but it can be a bit too lousy at times,ppl talk kinda LOUND there, if you know what i mean!",
          "We visited this place as it was recommended by TripAdvisor as one of the top 10 places to visit in Chengdu. It's very touristy, you can buy souvenirs for home here. No bargaining. Most of the time they only accept cash and their local credit card. The many local snacks are quite",
          "They did a pretty good job with this place as far as how it looks, I enjoyed the monochromatic photo/sculpture things on display in the streets. I felt it was a bit nicer/different from most other \u201etraditional\u201c alleys I\u2018ve seen in China, more like a re-interpretation. We didn\u2018t",
          "There's nothing historic here, just a bunch of themed shops that are new, but built in the old style. It takes 20 minutes tops to walk through both if you dont buy anything.",

          "Every time I visit China, I return to the Alleys. I love the hustle and bustle; the cacophony of voices that greets you as you approach. Wide and Narrow Alleys are busy, all year round. You can get away from the shoulder to shoulder crowds by ducking into one of the many",
          "Great place to explore if you don't mind the crowds. There are lots of shops and restaurants and it is in a central part of town.",
          "Great shopping and food. This is a good place to enjoy a tea ceremony and learn about tea. Storekeepers are friendly and not pushy. You will find all kinds of souvenirs.",
          "We visited this place on Sunday so it was rather busy and crowded. We tried a few local delicacies. Tasted good and it was a good experience for us. The Qing Dynasty buildings are good to view. Just that this place has become too commercialised.",
          "We took the sightseeing bus from the panda base to here which costed us 10 RMB and it took around half an hour. We were starving and just went in a place that sell different kinds of snack. The place was packed and we took it as a good sign and it surely didn\u2019t disappoint! I",

          "It's sometimes hard to wrap my mind around the age of China's recorded history. A visit to the ancient city with the enormous wall gives a glimpse of sophisticated society that existed so long ago.",
          "Here, the exterior of each building has been kept as its original looks. Inside the building, new things are exhibited. Thus you can buy something special or stuff with Chengdu style. Also, you can taste transitional Sichuan gourmet.",
          "We were disappointed with these streets. The beautiful old houses were overshadowed by the commercialism - pointless jewellery stores, tacky souvenirs and even a Starbucks. It would have been nice if they'd left the buildings without the need to fill them with tacky shops.",
          "This is not a typical downtown. Most of the boutique here and restaurant were designed culturally. If you were bargain hunter and a food enthusiast, this area is perfect for you.",
          "This street is a must-go in Chengdu, gorgeous little alleyways and reasonably (most of them anyway!) priced shops. Food is a little more pricey, but a lot of places do a Sichuanese opera (the one we saw was completely in Chinese) but I would still recommend even if you are not a",
          "Busy streets with no motorised tragic but very crowded with people. Stores are a bit higher prices as elsewhere but they are also better decorated and good athmosphere.",
          "The wide and narrow alleys are worth a visit. Lots of local restaurants and street food. Also a lot of neat shops that sell spices, crafts and all kinds of souvenirs.",
          "It is like Harry Potter, you run into a wall and enter into another world. Beautiful way of depicting history and art. Don't miss it if you visit Chengdu.",
          "Spending half a day walking up and down these alleys is a great way to get to know more about the cultural heritage in Chengdu. They are within walking distance of the town centre or if you don't feel like it, you can always take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the",
          "After almost two years working around Xichuan Province in China I got a recommendation to visit this place called Narrow & Wide alley (in English). It turned to be one of the best experience in Chengdu. There you can have a real taste of local culture including souvenirs,",
          "It's surprisongly enjoyable visit. There is quite a few things to do especially eating small meals throughout. There is also entertainment such as performances where you can sit down to relax.",
          "It's probably the most famous tourist spot in Chengdu city. So if you come to visit Chengdu, you are more than likely ending up here one time -- and one time is enough. It has been modernized so much that it is clearly catered to tourists -- foreign or domestic. Local people",
          "This pedestrian zone is really a wonderful place for tourists. Yes, it's touristy, but that's because they've done a good job of restoring the architecture to its original beauty and then filled each building with restaurants, shops, food stalls, and tea houses. It was mobbed",
          "Really worthy ur half day time visiting there and try everything you see, I believe you will love it. Do slow down ur steps and enjoy it.",
          "Chinese locals don\u2019t frequent this area as it is catered to tourists. We definitely had fun here as the streets are teaming with happy tourists gathered in small and narrow streets. The buildings are restored to resemble the old Qing Dynasty. You will just follow the crowds of",
          "I visited on a weekend and the alleys were throbbing with life. There are man F&B outlets and some upscale shops but I visited mainly to enjoy the vibrance. The old buildings were beautifully restored and an abundance of trees with green and yellow foliage made postcard pretty",
          "My overall score is three stars: fairly interesting, you won't regret visiting Unlike Jinli Pedestrian Street (see my other review), this area actually does have historical roots -- having been the site of a Manchu garrison -- but much seems to have been recently remodelled or",
          "Kuanzhai Ancient Street is quite famous, but I have been to many other cities in China and most of them have similar walking street. The food there is so so, I have 2 friends lived in Chengdu and they said actully the local doesn't visit this place and told me the food there is",
          "Crowded, lots of shops and trinkets - lots of panda merch but nothing really special. This area has alot of Sichuan opera/changing faces shows. Tickets range from 48 - 88 rmb in most places. I do always enjoy China at night when everything is lit up so if you stay until",
          "We took bus service 57 outside Jinli Pedestrian Walk for CNY1 and took a few minutes walk to this place. There are plenty of interesting shops and many very modern tea-houses here. It was quite crowded during our visit. The Chinese food can be rather intriguing with rabbit",
          "Visited both here and Jinli but I liked this area better as featured more of the teahouses and inns of Chengdu. Any visitor to Chengdu should do either here or Jinli but I recommend this area above Jinli.",
          "Similar to Jinli street, the streets are cleaner, buildings are older. There is a nice Starbuck here worth a visit!",
          "We went twice to the alleys and the best was in the evening when all the lights were on and the lanterns glowing. Some interesting displays and houses if you take the time to look at them as well as a good range of shops.",
          "Some confusion due to the three names in use for this pedestrian street, but certainly more pleasant to visit then Jinli Street. Lots of lovely sculptures - Chengdu has much public art - and Panda related merchandise is cheaper than at the Panda Research Base.",
          "Yes, lots of good shops -- from hammered silver to traditional souvenirs-- but be sure to enjoy the architecture that those ships enhabit. The alleys are very crowded on weekends. We went back during the week and found it much easier to navigate.",
          "walking street in Chengdu... worth spend some time here to explore the few alleys.... good place to take photos as well....",
          "A must go place in cheng du. Interesting food and alleys. Highly recommended. A lot of food and things to buy",
          "Similar to Jingli, lots of shops and restaurants in narrow streets. However, the overall feel is more upscale compared to Jingli. May uniquely designed or decorated stores. The restaurants are more formal, the foods offered are more sophisticated. Worth checking out.",
          "It is located at the downtown of Chengdu, taking Metro (subway) to Kuanzhai Xiang \u5bbd\u7a84\u5df7\u5b50 station is one of the best way to beat the heavy traffic of Chengdu, which cost you approx. RMB2/trip from ChunXi Road (where my hotel located). It is consisted of 3 streets which originated",
          "Busy alleys with some older buildings, many restaurants, opera theatres and cafes , nice for a stroll",

          "Big and small alleys filled with shops restaurants coffee and tea houses. We went there twice; first to see, second to shop. Most interestong part was to see professional ear cleaners in the streets. We bought tea from the Sichuan tea group as the tea leaves smelled lovely",

          "Whilst unquestionably aimed at extracting as much of the tourist dollar as possible the Wide and Narrow Streets attraction is worthy of a visit. You will be delighted with the plethora of fascinating food stalls, restaurants and ice cream shops! If you're after a gift for",
          "I love the architecture on the wall and amazed by them. Rows of shops to pick up souvenirs and street food. A good place for photo taking and strolling if you have some time to spare.",
          "We enjoyed our walk down this street so much that we decided to visit twice during our stay in Chengdu. Both times however it was extremely crowded and difficult to walk through. There are a lot of nice restaurants and cafes to hide away from the crowds when it all gets too",
          "We went early in the day 9.30am and felt like we had the place to ourselves. By 10.30am the tourists began to arrive. This is more upmarket than anywhere else we had visited in China. The artwork on the walls, the shops, and tasteful designed buildings all add to the ambience.",
          "Like many attractions labeled Ancient, it really isn't that ancient, but made to look that way but with some modern shops and stalls scattered about. Personally I find this rather charming and enjoyable. Lets face it, you can't really create an authentic small ancient street",
          "A commercial street that sells food and souvenir. One of the photo spots charge \u00a510 for admission. Another one is in fact a hotel now. Only those pictures taking from the old street is free of charge.",
          "I read a lot of good reviews about this place. To my surprise, I found it disappointing when I visited. It have a lot of restaurants, street food stands, and gifts shops but nothing really stand out. The only I remember about the place is the stink smell coming from the",
          "This was indeed a very interesting street. A lot of historical building with urban shops and restaurants. pretty street arts and interesting walls. lot of chinese snacks in kiosks and also traditional chinese arts. Beware of the crowds. I also saw the traditional ear cleaning",
          "I preferred this to Jinli street which is more touristy. There was a bustling atmosphere on saturday night. Many bars and restaraunts, shops and entertainments. There are many interesting buildings in the area.",
          "Best thing to do in Chengdu. Tons of famous street snacks. Lots of local street artist and workers. Busy energy from tourists. Loved it here. So fun. Evening is the best time.",

          "The place is crowded, there is a Starbucks (which is not a plus), and it lost a bit of its authenticity. But to get an idea of the ancient city, this is a great place to go. The streets are bustling, there are shops, theatres, antique houses and gardens, and restaurants. The",
          "We're walking around with a local friend and the street, the buildings, the shops, the workshops and the street stalls are a fantastic way to get some taste of old Chinese culture",
          "There're many attractive shops and I could feel traditional atmosphere of China. I really enjoyed delicious meal and coffee here.",
          "very good place. it combined the ancient buildings and modern elements. a great place for shopping, eating, relaxing and experience the local food and culture",
          "There are 2 main streets: 1 wide and 1 narrow.. maybe in terms of older days but seriously u can't see the difference now especially with the crowds when u can't move much. Building structure is very nostalgic and get a good old feel but with almost every shop being souvenirs or",
          "During our visit to Chengdu, we wanted to do some local shopping for gifts, souvenirs and more and was told about an ancient section of Chengdu known as Kuanzhai Alley, built/established during the Qing Dynasty. Now this sounded like a great place to visit. This area consists",
          "The wide and narrow alley was the most polished of all the attractions we visited in Chengdu. It was renovated in 2008 so everything was prestine. There was lots of street art and performers and endless bars and restaurants, and boutique stores. A great place to people watch",
          "Me and my friend went there once during the day and once during the night. Regardless of when you visit, be careful of your belongings as the streets are very crowded. There are a lot of street food vendors, silverware shops and tea houses. Even if none of that interests you,",
          "None of the buildings look genuine ancient. It just looks like one big souvenir shop. And it's really crowded. Perfect place for pocket thieves!",
          "I biked over from where I was staying and enjoyed the place. Some interesting historical sites and nice way to explore. Lots of places to shop if that is your thing also some nice coffee and tea shops. Interesting food items on offer and the usual Chinese friendly merchants.",
          "Amazingly beautiful to walk through ancient buildings left untouched and included in the modern high rise city! Preserving physical evidence of ancestry and leaving it for future generations is just some of the magnificent sites to see around China.",
          "We enjoyed our time wandering the alleys. Plenty of interesting shops to look into and foods to try. Worth a visit and easy to get to.",
          "Lovely neighborhood of homes and businesses with ancient architectural style, tea houses, and many shops. Lots of food vendors.",
          "This is actually at least three (3) small street, parallel to each other, in a compact area just slightly west of Tianfu Square and very slightly northwest of People's Park (both of which you must also visit). They are similar to Jinli Street in that they are narrow, for",
          "Plan on spending a entire day here, there is a lot to see and take in, this is just like going back in time and walking down the streets of yester-years, you will simple enjoy and bring your billfold.....many things to see and watch....",
          "This isn't authentic, it is crowded, and it is expensive. But there are also good bars, some decent food, and a fun night out.",
          "These few streets are little touristy gems. The old style architecture gives it a very unique feel in a large city rapidly developing. Lots of people but you're on holidays so taking time is what you do. We wandered around for just over an hour. It does have an almost upmarket",
          "I prefer Jinli street than this narrow and too crowded shopping street. And almost all eats and desserts are quite like the ones at Jinli Street. So just came here to have a quick look and tasted some of the snacks. Watch out for the infamous San Da Pao, its like mochi",
          "Many people for sure. Worth to come here to see the buildings which preserve the old Mengchu style architecture. A lot of coffee shop, hawkers food and restaurant. I saw the American chinese chef Martin Yan went inside one of the restaurant for video shooting. Hire a guide,",
          "We had so much fun strolling in Kuanzhai alley as it consists of Wide Alley, Narrow Alley and Well Alley.Wide and Narrow Alley is one of Chengdu's historical and cultural reserves. Very crowded with tourists but you still have room to take photos. Yes, here you still can try",
          "Nice Alleys to stroll. There are 4 alleys with different era architectures. You can get the feel of the old time villages along the alley.",
          "The narrow & wide alleys have some interesting artwork. The tiny shops are not much different from anywhere else in China. Only worthwhile visiting if you haven't got much on.",
          "This is a very representative historic place at Chengdu. Very clean, though crowded, as in many scenic places in China. The restaurants worth a try, and the cost is fair in general. Hot-pot is highly recommended.",
          "full of shops and it's a good place to buy souvenirs. Wouldn't suggest dining here though there are quite a number of restaurants.",
          "Fun short little walk down a tourist trap of a shopping area. The Starbucks was well designed to look Chinese. Many of the building are either old or renovated to resemble an ancient look. Ok place to get touristy trinkets. No need to book a tour as its easy to access via",
          "This street is much better and more spacious than Jingli street. Same kind of situation with stalls selling all kinds of food and souvenirs. However this area has more restaurants and cafe type establishments than Jingli. I suggest going after sunset so that there's less people",
          "Really enjoyed walking through the Kuan, Zhai and the adjacent Well alley. The buildings were well preserved and the area was very lively with tea houses, shops, ear cleaning 'stalls', street performances. Look out for the bronze statues/wall panels with informative write ups",
          "This is one site with historical values of Qing Dynasty in Chengdu. Apart from the ancient background, it has a variety of other attractions such as shrines, the traditional production of local food.",
          "There were so much teahouses, cafes and interesting shops. There's a good balance of new and old shops for one to spend time walking leisurely down and you wont have to worry getting lost. The streets are pretty simple",
          "Certainly one of the nicest areas of Chengdu ! ( Much better than Jinli Street ) . The shops sell quality items , and you feel free to stroll around leisurely without being pushed by overzealous vendors ! And you are greeted with a smile....",
          "I enjoyed a lot the visit even though it was not included in our already organized tour and the guide subtlety suggested \" it was expensive \" we decided to go by ourselves . Metro reachs one of the extremes of the alleys . We did not think it was expensive at all , found",
          "Lovely place..with lots of shops and interesting architecture. If you want to buy panda soft toy, the shop outside the alley got good choices and reasonable price too. The subway station is Kuanzhai alley(something like this).",
          "Having visited few other valleys in China, including Beijing, i find this is a very nice place to visit. Can easily spend half or even one day here at leisure. Goods and food sold here are reasonably priced without having to bargain much and items are pretty unique. Many",
          "Renovated buildings with cute retail shops and restaurants. Like many tourist areas, packed with people but well worth the visit. Food stalls with everything from cotton candy, mango drinks, rabbit heads, squid sticks, tofu and more. Restaurants were a bit pricey for China.",
          "Similarly to Jinli, these are traditional alleyway streets. I did prefer these streets to Jinli but that is just a personal preferences. It's more of a courtyard-village alleyway. It has gone through relatively recent renovations so it does have a more clean feel than Jinli. It",
          "Just back from a visit to the street. Very orderly, clean and organized. This attraction can be reached by subway. This afternoon while I was there it was mainly locals and I could not pick out any foreigners from the crowd. Straight streets of shops on either side and at least",
          "very easy to find as it is right next to the metro exit and there are signs to point you to the alleys. Unfortunately it is packed with tourists so isn't that easy to walk around (we went during non peak season. can't imagine how bad it gets for peak season). Loads of",

          "Be prepared for crowds especially if you're there during a holiday but enjoy the very many shops and restaurants you're sure to find. We enjoyed Sichuan lunch with live entertainment at Chengdu Ying Xiang (Zhai Xiang Zi). We had prior reservations and a great table in front of",
          "We went on a weekday afternoon in March and there were a TON of people. It was hard to make sure we did not get separated, that's how many people there were. But it was still a cool experience, with lots of little shops and tea gardens hidden in little pockets of the street.",
          "A wonderful place and historical street that u must visit if u are here . All houses are old and beautifully built . They transformed them into shop or restaurant. It's crowded even weekday , so I recommended u come only during weekday . The Starbucks is so historical and",
          "Many shops and restaurants there! But I personally do not like over developed and commercialized tourist spot.",
          "This is a \"must-do\" in Chengdu but really it can be passed unless you have time to spare. We went on a Friday at around 2pm and it was insanely packed with local tourists with selfie sticks and tour groups. It was totally overwhelming. On top of that, maybe it was charming in",
          "We were really looking forward to wandering around here, however we're a little disappointed. Although lovely to look at, and interesting in places, we didn't really enjoy much more... The crowds were crazy with rude people pushing you, stopping in front of you and taking",

          "I went there on my last day of Chengdu trip, it's such a pity that I did not bring enough money. So many cute characters from the past dynasty. Though my advice is that, do not buy from the shops inside the alley (you can't bargain the prices either), there is one shop outside",
          "We stayed right next to Kuanzhai Alleys when we visited Chengdu and wandered around here quite a lot to visit restaurants and eat good food. We were never disappointed! Even simple little restaurants in this neighbourhood serve delicious, fiery food. Plus the atmosphere of",
          "Well worth a stroll. Interesting glimpses into the past in terms of artefacts, good and entertainment. Plenty of tourists, local and foreign wander through old buildings that connect to another street. Check out one stall that offers postcards with a difference!",
          "These streets are similar to Jinli but feature more higher end Sichuan Restaurants with performances that would be suitable for dinner. Lively area for handicrafts, snacks and local flavors.",
          "This area is nice for walking around and people watching. It reminds me strongly of many other \"old towns\" in china. Still, nice enough. Lots of shops with normal Chinese touristy stuff. Very little really unique. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants.",
          "Nice and great place for shopping. Have variety of choice and reasonable price. Not too pack with people. Have beautiful ancient place to take pictures and hang out at classy style of starbuck",
          "This is a fun place with alleys for eating, shopping and enjoyment. The focus is local crafts where one purchases gifts to take home. Obviously, it is quite \"touristy\" and many shops selling identical goods. There are three alleys and many artistic walls. Goods are a little",
          "Enjoyed the restaurants, face changing performances, the street food and the souvenir shops. There's a subway station right at the entrance.",
          "Came here just to kill time, but had enjoyed the trip. We didn't buy anything but just walked down both streets, window & people watching. There are lots of shops & eating places. The streets were crowded as it was Saturday but many obnoxious people kept gawking at a black",
          "We have heard of many such ancient and touristy streets in China. Many of them turned out to be a disappointment due to the poor balance between preservation of heritage and commercialism. Thus I was sceptical when I found out about this ancient street. This was my 2nd",

          "This is a cultural heritage left from the Qing dynasty. Now it offers restaurants housed in the historical buildings from that period, and various art and souvenir shops. Only two long Main Streets. It takes only 20 minutes to just browse thru them. Always crowded. Definitely a",
          "I have this place a 4 instead of a 5 just because it's smaller and less exciting than Jin Li, but still a must see! I love the cultural atmosphere of the wide and narrow alleys, and a great place to just walk around in fascination from everything that you see. From unique",
          "the atmosphere was great, felt i was sent back to china in the traditional era. Tried a couple of the street food, even though some of them were a bit expensive but it was great! a couple of german restaurants that had nice interior and great customer service as well.",
          "Nothing exciting - a very bustling tourist area filled with expensive souvenir shops and restaurants. Spent 15minutes to walk the whole thing and left. Nothing to write home about unless this is your first time in china. Take a brief walk if you have absolutely nothing to do",
          "Shopping, restaurants, bars, art & Sichuan Opera all in 3 well kept alleys. We saw the opera here (more variety show than opera in western definition) as we didn't want to dedicate a whole evening to it. 45 mins was enough & required no booking in advance",
          "This street area is billed as a must see for tourists- it is pretty but like so many places such as this around the world it is a sterilized version of the local culture. I strongly suggest walking the back streets of Chengdu to visit the local markets. This area has gift shops",
          "Interesting place. Street where rich families of Chengdu used to live. Some are still occupied. But nothing breathtaking",
          "We didn't have much time to play tourist however, this area was full of history and was very convenient to where we were staying.",
          "Maybe there was an ancient street at some point, but nowadays its different stores, restaurants and souvenir shops. Looks cute but all buildings look new. It wont take you long to see all three streets. But go there only if you have free time and if you already visited all main",
          "nothing special. you can find it in every tourist cities in China with different street names. If you are coming to China first time maybe worth to visit it.",
          "Kuan Zhai street is the best to walk and you will find lots of restaurants as well street food. You can finish the walk in around 40-45 min walking slow and experience the few local designers selling there products.",
          "Highly recommended. They surely have some interesting stuffs for everyone of you. You can also get your local snacks at those shops just outside before you enter into the alleys. Interesting place for me and everyone should try go there for a feel of Chinese culture!",
          "I came here 3 times during Chengdu trip. The first time was at night, after coming back from JiuZhai Valley. The 2nd time was the next day (on day time) and the last one was on the last day of the trip. To these ancient Street like Kuanzhai, you should visit on day time and",

          "This is similar to most old towns in China which means it's not real. Most architecture and buildings have been rebuilt recently. Kuanzhai is also known as wide and narrow alley. There are 3 parallel alleys. 90% of the area is occupied with souvenir shops, restaurants and",
          "We really enjoyed walking down the street and seeing all the sights. There are a lot of souvenirs on sale here and there's lots of snacks you can try. We saw a lot of tea houses and restaurants but we didn't try any. You can also get your ears cleaned which we didn't try, but",
          "if it's your first time in China you will probably love this place. The buildings are beautiful and there is many shops where you can buy all sort of things. For me personaly is not that exciting since I've seen a lot of this kind of street not only in Chengdu but also in",
          "The Wide and Narrow Alleys provide plenty of material for people-watching and photographing. The atmosphere is that of an old city street with vendors and stores lining both sides. I really enjoyed the photographs that are partly 3D on the street walls. There is historical",

          "This place is very well conserved and now turned in a tourist attraction. A must visit to see the culture of chengdu and china. There are food stalls, restaurants, tea houses, boutiques, gift shops, Chinese operas, antiques, etc. Easily 2 hrs and the place is clean.",
          "Went there with my family for a stroll. Was very impressed with the cleanness of the place. Surprising the prices for the items from street Hawkers in push cart are fixed. No bargaining. A lot of interesting food to try out. I tried the famed rabbit meat but found it too",
          "Kuan ZhaiXIangZI is a famous sightseeing in Chengdu. Many visitors came there and left a really good comment about it. With many restaurants and clubs here, if you are a traveler who likes beer and food, you will have much more there at night. Comparing to Kuan ZhaiXiangZi, I",
          "This place is a must see while in Chengdu although you will not find any Pandas here other than the plastic ones! Within this area you will find a great deal of food and souvenirs, all very authentic. There are also several venues for the Facing Changing Opera shows. This is",
          "Fantastic little wide and narrow lanes, with plenty of random shopping, food and tea houses. Can get very busy in some parts. Only two stops down from Tianfu Square train station.",
          "Every place in China that is attended to, cared for, kept in a proper state, is a tourist attraction. Like a Swiss tourist village. Chinese people come and look how nice a place can be if one pays some attention to beautification and decoration. That is all the attraction in",
          "This is my second time visit to Kuanzai Ancient street. It is easy accessable by taking subway line 4 drop off at Kuanzai Street station. Basically as it is one of the famous tourist spot so it will always crowded with people either local or foreigner. Shops available selling",
          "If you go in the evening it is more beautiful with the lights on, but expect a lot more people. It was fun to walk trough but after a while we got tired of people bumping into us all the time.",
          "Nice looking area but getting commercialized now, even a starbucks on the street :) interesting shops, and some traditional foods and treats worth seeing",
          "The place was very crowded since it was a saturday afternoon and the weather was perfect. Many interesting food and wares were on sale. It features plenty of everything, i.e local food, ancient products and tourist souveneirs. There was only 1 public toilet at the entrance.",
          "You can find some cute and reasonable gift at those panda souvenir stores. Clothing and gifts are overpriced. Walk over 3 more streets you can find some local restaurants If time is not an issue. Traffic can get worse during school hour around 8:30am and 4:30pm. Overall it's a",
          "Great place to sample street food and people watch. Quirky shops. Lots of places to sample tea. Very busy.",
          "These streets are touristy and commercialised. Everything looked pretty new to me and people seemed to be lapping that up.",
          "Reserve two hours or more for this spot. There are some ancient buildings, interesting architecture, coffee shops and bars, with a fusion of modern and cultural style.",
          "Great street for shopping and tea houses. Very crowded, but not a problem. Prices are ok, you can probably spend a few hours there",
          "There are a lot of restaurants, shops and kiosks. I had a hot-pot dinner which was very spicy. It is a very famous attraction so there was a lot of people.",
          "Fun place to visit! Go at night. You can easily get here using the metro. There are a lot of restaurants! The food isn't the best one i had in China so far but the location is nice!",
          "Great for getting little bits and bobs for the family/friends. Prices are reasonable. Lovely traditional buildings.",
          "I have spent here one evening looking for a place to have dinner. The biggest problem is that basically no restaurant accepts credit cards so you need to have a lot of cash with you. If you look for an European style restaurant after some days of Chinese restaurants I recommend",
          "The Alley (street) isn't that long but quite interesting. Spent a couple of hours exploring the shops, some new some older. Some of the original buildings are still standing. Quite a tourist attraction with many bus loads of visitors arriving throughout the day. Worth a look if",
          "Good one. Three busy alleys arranged in parallel order. You can buy souvenirs there and simply taste old China. Must see if you are in Chengdu!",
          "One of the \"must visit\" place if this is your first time to Chengdu. There are few restaurants, pubs & teahouse for you to choose, to sit down and chi chat with friends. There is one section whereby you can take some nice photos with the 3D walls.",
          "If u want somewhere relaxing to spend your afternoon, kuanzhai is a good choice. Although commercial and crowded with tourists, still good to find some interesting shops and bars to spend your day.",
          "This place is a proof to the fact that not all touristy place are necessarily bad. It is lively, colorful, interesting and full of action. Definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. Restaurants are expensive by comparison to other local joints.",
          "We very much enjoyed strolling around this beautifully restored old Chengdu pedestrian area, full of residents and visitors enjoying the Autumn Moon Festival. Filled with nice shops, restaurants and tea houses, it was a fun way to spend an afternoon.",
          "The wide&narrow lane. Originally from the Ming dynasty..half is old, other half is renovated to shops/restaurants. In ancient times a lot of soldiers came to this area, the narrow street for the normal soldiers (now only Chinese street food) and the wide lane for the horses &",
          "Cool place to walk around. Was easy to taxi over from Du Fu Cottage. The eateries seemed a bit overpriced, perhaps a bit touristy. Some good street food options.",
          "A lot of restaurants, bars, street vendors and different shops. If you even have no intention to buy anything, it's very nice to wonder around. You can easily spend 2 hours there just looking and taking pictures.",
          "Typical chinese pedestrian street , with tea houses, vendors selling Chinese souvenirs. A bit pricier than Jin Li pedestrian street. Very crowded on public holidays so best avoided on those days.",
          "Fun to walk through the alleys and look in the shops, Very crowded but still a good time. A lot of cool things in the walls to take photos with and of! Stop and have lunch or some tea and people watch!",
          "We enjoyed the trip to KZ Ancient Street very much. There were many interesting little shops selling souvenirs as well as cafes everywhere along the walking street. There was also a Starbucks with Chinese style architecture. Even if you are not a fan of shopping, this place is",
          "Experienced the local delicacies and culture at these streets. Got some nice little souvenirs for family and friends here as well.",
          "Good place to spend a couple of hours on souvenir shopping. Some stores are a bit pricey so bargain.",
          "I had first visited the Kuan Zhai Alley before going to the Jinli pedestrianised area the following day. Both are pedestrianised areas showcasing some old houses that had been restored or renovated, souvenir shops, food stalls, restaurants, performances. If you are at Kuan Zhai",
          "Too busy to the point you want to get out like now! - it's attractive but very very touristy! High end shopping - not cheap.",
          "A compact area with a very wide selection of restaurants and shops. Good for a stroll and there's something in every price class. It's doubtful that anything is more than a few years old, but it's built to mimic the older styles and it does look nice. If you're in the area",
          "We toured the street after the temple as they are adjacent. Mostly vendors selling the same stuff you see everywhere and lots of food booths, with exotic meats like Yak and then the duck, rabbit heads and other animal parts.",
          "We walked here from our hotel as it was only 10 mins away. We did enjoy ourselves, there's plenty of shops, bars and places to get food. It does feel a bit like Jinli's poorer cousin. It has much of the same type of shops and food, but it's just not as big. On the plus side",
          "In contrast to Jinli, Kuanzhai is a tastefully attractive ancient style street with some nice shops and restaurants, well suited to a pleasant walk before or after dinner in one of the many restaurants.",
          "A very cool place to site see, shop and eat! We visited with friends do had translation handy to ask questions and try to help talk down prices.... As it says the wide and narrow streets are full of history and culture... A must see",
          "Artsy crafty shops without the usual tourist rubbish. clearly this area has been developed to attract tourists and diners alike. Worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful old streets which showcase the traditional architecture in a modern setting. Beautiful place for a stroll in the early evening. Be warned that it is a tourist hot pot and as such the prices are a little higher than else where but certainly worth it!",
          "We didn't really appreciate the spot. So many people were there it was impossible to walk through in a regular pace. People pushing from every side and merchants praising their articles aggressively made for bad vibes of these alleys. I'm sure the alleys would have been nice,",
          "Lotsa Chengdu souvenirs available at great bargains! especially panda items! there are several shops where you can watch 'changing face' Sichuan opera. I paid 38 yuan for one show that lasted about 1 to 1.5 hours. You can also get your ears cleaned at stalls along the lanes but",
          "I prefer Jinli Pedestrian Street than here as it is smaller but more crowded with similar local shops and food. Easier to get here from train station by just 5 mins walk. Only good point than Jinli if you don't have enough time.",
          "Wide and Narrow Street is one of my favorite areas in Chengdu. I love walking the small alleys without having to worry about traffic, bikes, and scooters. The area is a major attraction and is almost always guaranteed to be filled with throngs of happy tourists taking pictures",
          "The whole place have been rebuilt and just kept in the old style. It is really too commercialized. Tides of people there even on weekdays. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to spend a quiet time. There are some old towns around Chengdu which I really appreciate!",
          "For gifts for the folks back home, is a nice place to go. There are many shops from cheaper items to some very expensive items so it will satisfy most any budget!",
          "We headed there for lunch after seeing the pandas. The taxi ride took forever. We chose a lovely courtyard and had simple Chinese lunch. The street can be so noisy but the courtyards are lovely and quiet. Make sure to have some Koeko (or similar) ice-cream. Tastes like in",
          "I've been here so many times. I used to work at a school right around the corner... Rainy days are the best because there's very little if any people out there. Usually it's so crowded and uncomfortable otherwise... They do have great food and the architecture does represent the",
          "First, I have to say we are not big shoppers. However, the street is worth the experience especially if you can find you way into a courtyard to escape the pushy crowds.",
          "The streets north of these were much more interesting and full of local restaurants and locals. This street was interesting because of all the Chinese tourists and gift shops.",
          "Such a lovely street to walk down in the evening, lots of Chinese street snacks on offer, lots of cheap souvenir stores, lots of restaurants and there's always something going on here. Very vibrant and don't be afraid to try new things. When I was here it started raining but it",
          "That is the question: Wide and Narrow St or Jinli Pedestrian St? If you have time, do both. If not, here's my take (after having visited both): Wide and Narrow is easy to get to by Chengdu Metro and a smaller in terms of overall area than Jinli. I thought Wide and Narrow St",
          "The wide and narrow alley has a lot to offer. From all the tea houses that you can also catch a Sichuan Opera show, to the tea house/pub to grab a bottomless tea or a pint of beer. Add all the souvenir shop to the mix, you got yourself a great way to spend an evening. There",
          "Great shops and restaurants, and food stalls - interesting souvenirs for sale, good quality things. Nicely kept, clean and tidy. Interesting art display aswell.",
          "If u like historic and ancient building, this is the place. There's one place name Chinese Art and Craft Living Museum which is newly opened. Love the craft there, those statues are just so beautiful .... feel calm and excited there",
          "This is an interesting example of the old Chengdu streets made touristy for today's market. Full of Chinese tourists. We were the only Europeans in sight. Lots of food places but all look touristy, worth a look but not something to worry about missing. There seems to be quite a",
          "Marginally more interesting than JinLi. Better, more authentic restaurants can be found on North Xi'an road, a ten minute walk northeast.",
          "The street is very nice but very expensive and extremely crowded. Wouldn't buy a thing there, but definitely nice experience. And the entire area is nice",
          "We have been here twice.- during the day and at night. The buildings are amazing. We went into one place for lunch. When you walk into the doorway there were trees growing and tables around the area. The menu was completely in Chinese but we chanced ordering from the pictures",
          "Another ancient street in Chengdu, which lacks behind Jinli street. No matter at which time of the day you come, there are always massive crowds. While the ambiance in general is very nice, this destroys the experience. The stores are nice and of upper price level. Don't come",
          "Touristy spot in Chengdu and crowded at night, but really fun to stroll around. Many souvenier stores, restaurants, bars and food stands. Traditional Chinese houses make out the atmosphere of this place. Many photo opportunities including the on streat ear treatment and crispy",
          "Another interesting place to visit in the area. Bustling ancient street market, old buildings in true ancient Chinese style",
          "An amazing street with several old buildings Definitely bargain for prices here. Start with half the price and they will probably come down a significant amount. There is an amazing tea house you should visit here just to see it. It's very traditionally made such as several",
          "We received directions to this street but were almost lost. Unfortunately Chinese people could not explain how to get there due to language problems. We visited on a saturday night in the Chinese holiday season and it was crowded. After a while we noticed that wre were on a",
          "Very nice area to eat and go out in the evening. A lot of very stylish bars and many restaurants with many choices what to eat.",
          "The place was packed on a saturday but very lively with interesting shops, found a bar on the \"narrow\" lane which made for a nice respite.",
          "This is one of those old/ renovated street complexes,, a tourist magnet, which is to be enjoyed with your ears and eyes.The architecture of the houses lining the streets is something for history buffs. The stores are as usual touristy, mostly for domestic consumption",
          "This is a great place to find the souvenirs you need to take with you. Many shops and stalls, plus good dining facilities for local food/. Worth the trip.",
          "We re so happy to come to this place...yes it is crowded but you cant buy the atmosphere and the ambience of the this vicinity.... The shop sells range from traditional chinese foods to silverware and jewelry. The safety was ok as we saw a lot of police present in the area.",
          "There are a lot of stalls and food vendors selling food and products there. Great to wonder round at night time. Things close up at about 10pm, with a few bars staying open.",
          "If you are familiar with China, I am not sure of the value-added. But if not, then it is on the metro-line and it does offer traditional 19th century architecture (60% authentic, 40% reconstructed in the same style). Souvenir shops, tea houses and street food vie for",
          "Do go earlier if you want to take noce photographs of the place. May take 2 hours or more to really walk through the lanes. Good for buying little souvenirs and wating local snacks",
          "Visited on a rainy weekday eve but was still enjoyable. Lots of quirky little shops mainly selling touristy items, lots of street foods and restaurants. A good place to have a walk around and easy to get to as close to the metro.",
          "nice tourist spot with street food and very good hotpot! I like narrow street more than wide street and is worth visiting at night!",
          "The things in this street are slightly pricey as it's a popular tourist area but you could find great food and really nice hotpots in the area with nice decorations, it's a place worth visiting and especially at night it can look pretty different from when visiting in the",
          "I know, I know, it's newly built and not authentic - but it's a great fun place to visit after you paid cultural dues to those authentic sightseeing places and need panda souvenirs, tea, delicious street food and entertainment! We loved streets wide and narrow, it's a belly and",
          "This is another make-over traditional looking pedestrian street. Like many others in Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities, it offers traditional snacks, some live performance of how the food is cooked. If you have a few hours to kill, this is a place to hang around to soak",
          "Historical homes are now shops and tea rooms. Again, little difficult in the rest room category for Western visitors. Practice those squats, ladies!",
          "Having been called as the namecard of Chengdu by many tourists, Kuanzhai Alley( Broad&Narrow Street) has attacted many new traveller's attention. With three alleies lying paralleledly, each one has its own uniqueness. As a local girl and guide, i think the reason why Kuanzhai",
          "These streets are great for people watching, shopping, eating and just browsing. There are shops for every pocketbook and interest. Walking through this area is a must for any visitor to Chengdu.",
          "Our guide Cecilia brought us to this street and WOW it is amazing totally loved this, lots of character and lots of very talented people. We love going where the locals hang out! Lots of variety here, from handmade cavings and sugar art, to hot pots, tea shops and great silk",
          "The Wide and Narrow streets are worth a visit, lots of restaurants, can be busy but pleasant to walk around",
          "Was nice wandering through the 2 alleys. Especially enjoyed the hot, fresh snacks which were all 10 yuan. Try the spicy silken tofu - it was popular food good reason. Also the hot pineapple rice.",
          "This is a fun touristy area with lots of folks walking around in the evenings. There is a lot of shopping and there are several restaurants. There were some street performers, and the bars had a lot of performers too.",
          "During our private tour with Aline we stopped on the way back to our hotel on the Wide and Narrow Street. This is a shopping and street food area that is fun to visit and shop. We did actually find a couple of souvenirs as gifts for family at home here. Very interesting area,",
          "We thought it would just be another commercial street selling the same souvenir all over the street. It was so not that! The buildings are refreshingly Chinese and the merchandise is top notch. We also had the best dandan noodle in one of the restaurants. Would have stayed",
          "a little bit of chinese history, nice shops, good restaurants, old tradition meets modern tourism . . . it is a really nice place to visit especially in the evening, when the lights go on and everything is colorful, the heat of the day slowly ceases and you enjoy sinchuan with",
          "It has nice architecture and a nice atmosphere (I went during daytime), so it's great for window shoppers. However, the items are overpriced. It's still worth a visit if you enjoy casually walking and looking at random things!",
          "Really great place to try some great food, souvenirs, and plenty of interesting things to see! Really would recommend, day or night. The way to the dragon is a great hot pot dinner with Sichuan opera on Saturday nights. A great show and meal! Definitely try to visit",
          "Quite a nice and clean place (for China standards), lots of street food and tea houses around but other than that the shops didn't appeal to me. You can probably go there to take some photos. The place was smaller than expected.",
          "Yes, it's a bit touristy, but it also is very domestic, i.e., filled with locals. Just a wonderful place to wander aimlessly, chose a restaurant or street food, watch people, and enjoy the hot evenings. Highly recommend allowing a couple of hours to just experience the",
          "A crowded place that full of different street food and some Sichuan style tea houses. The streets are not wide and keep those old architectural objects or style. Perhaps, a bit too crowded but it's the way that attracts people and tourists. However, it stills a nice place to",
          "A great place for tourists who like markets and interesting different things to look at. Lots of local food to try, but also extremely crowded when we were there. All part of the genuine China experience.",
          "With so much restoration these \"ancient\" streets all looked the same to me. Their original identity is lost and replaced with an idealised version of an old street. Having said that, I would recommend seeing one ancient street during a trip to Chengdu. I thought Jinli Street",
          "This is quite similar to Jinli pedestrian street but without the gardens and pond. There are plenty of restaurants and shops selling souvenirs. Tea houses are everywhere but you can also find Starbucks and some local coffe cafes. The teahouse close to the exit by the main road",
          "My sister and I stayed at a hotel close by Kuanzhai last November so we went through the streets several times during our 4 day stay. The experience you have willl differ depending on how busy the area is. We had tea in the area on a Sunday afternoon and there were tons of",
          "Though it's going to be touristy no matter when you go, this is a nice area to walk through. Recommend it for families with kids, and it is fine for strollers. We enjoyed stopping in kiosks for snacks along the way--yogurt at one place, tofu in another, small savory dishes--and",
          "A tourist area that has been recreated to resemble what the architecture may have looked like at the time, but it is then populated by tourist trap restaurants and shops. A lot of tourists (but I was there on the weekend to be fair), but as an experience it wasn't all that fun",
          "Crowded and touristy (mostly in-country tourists)- but there are some architectural gems like old courtyard houses. There are also many food stalls and vendors selling local street food as well as ear-digging services (yes!) - all that creates a noisy festive kind of atmosphere",
          "This is a very crowded pedestrian street, with lots of small shops selling trinkets and food. A nice place to walk and eat tidbits, if it wasn't so crowded",
          "We went to the Wide and Narrow Streets on a Wednesday night and didn't find it too crowded. There are lots of shops and you could spend quite a while browsing all different types of items! There is a stand where a man will paint your name and a poem in Chinese, and there are all",
          "The streets are full of shops and kiosks. Not particularly interested. There are some old classic Chinese houses and now converted into a restaurant, we went inside to take a look but it was just too crowded so we didn't have a chance to venture more.",
          "I checked out this area at the advice of a guide I had in the city. I was on my own and there were some sections that were very crowded. It was a fun place to walk around still with lots of shops and food.",
          "Lots of Chinese food, you can find some souvenirs here, especially on the pedestrian crossing bridge on the end of street",
          "A maze of one-storey buildings housing a variety of restaurants and stores selling artwork, tea and souvenirs. The area is clean and popular.. We were told to be careful of pickpockets if only because of the crowded narrow streets. It is more touristy than authentic, but",
          "can spend an hour or two strolling the 3 streets. you get many tea houses, shops selling knick-knacks of sorts and souvenirs. walking around in cool weather is quite enoyable",
          "This is another interesting street to visit in Chengdu. It is close to Kuanzhai ancient street so I'd recommend doing both of those in one go as they are also quite similar in style. This whole area is a bit commercial nevertheless the street is worth visiting.",
          "This place is nice for a stroll. It is a bit of a tourist trap so only go in the restaurants here if you feel fine about paying a bit of a tourist premium. The street looks interesting though and is certainly worth walking through.",
          "lots of people here. you can find a lot of local touristy staff. If you do not have a lot of time in Chengdu, this is one place where you can get to see/buy most of local souvenirs and taste some local food",
          "Try hot pot, must try even if you're unsure, should be the culinary experience of your stay in Chengdu. It can be stressful four newbies, but ask for meats and greens that doesn't get old fast. The rest are kind of meh... There's a panda post office that is fun! Remember to",
          "As previous reviewers have mentioned this is a great place to see the architecture and way of life of the Qing Dynasty, the only drawback is because it is so interesting it gets unbearably overcrowded (I did go on a Saturday) only reason I didn't put 5 stars.",
          "Kuanzhai alleys seem to take me back in time to the Qing dynasty period, but have been tastefully done up to attract today's crowds. Apart from the many shops, restaurants and cafes, this is a very picturesque place. It does get crowded on weekends and holidays so do try to",
          "Variously shops and restaurants, suitable for age of ppl. Nice food but bit dear compare with other local restaurants. Nice to see the traditional buildings.",
          "Too crowded. Went on a public holiday and the streets were literally packed like sardines, was challenging to manoeuvre your way into shops or take photos etc. However, the streets provides nice cultural insights to the history of Chengdu and there are many street side stalls",
          "A great place to explore and get lost in. It has a variety of shops ranging from local clothing to high end stores. I stopped in a tea house for a couple of hours to hang out and get some wifi. People in Chengdu, love to hang out this way, not too shabby!",
          "Architecturally the exteriors of these buildings are true to their age. However, most of the interiors are now shops and restaurants and reflect their new owners desires. Some good some bad but not the original look in most cases. However in a minority of cases there is a close",
          "Nice buildings in a traditional style. Good for photographs. However all the buildings are shops. If you know what you want to buy you could go elsewhere as the shops here sell more expensively!",
          "An interesting place...not too crowded didn't get to try a lot of food because of the crowds but this was a national holiday",
          "We took our guide with us here with made life so much easier as no one speaks English. Sample wonder local foods, take in the sites and enjoy the many activities that go on in this very charming old part of Chengdu. The traditional streets are wonderful. Just a hint don't do the",
          "This is a must visit place in Chengdu, if you got little time, just visit her. Short taxi trip from any hotel and cheap if you find too far to walk. So many stor here selling all kinds of stuffs. My rating: 5 star.",
          "It is basically two streets with mostly restaurants and souvenir shops. It is interesting to see what people are eating. There is even a Starbucks housed in a beautiful old mansion with a nice courtyard. The most interesting thing I saw was a man getting his ear \"cleaned\" by",
          "I expected more, I wasn't overly impressed. The crowd makes the whole trip off putting. I've gotten quite used to the shuffling mentality in Chengdu, but it doesn't make you feel relax! Best to walk alongside the outer corners of Kuanzhai, where you will see less people. I",
          "When you decide to come over during the weekends, be prepared for the mass of people you will encounter. This won't be an easy stroll, more like a shuffle train! Don't bother coming here if you can't stand masses of people pushing elbow to elbow. You'll be better off going to",
          "Lots to see - a lot of historical buildings. Lots of different food outlets with reasonable prices also. Such a beautiful place - it's nice to experience with people who speak the language. It will help you to understand more about the culture and history. Lots of cool",
          "Kuanzhai is a cool and vibrant walking street in Chengdu. Strolling through the stone covered narrow streets is fascinating. It has a nice blend of small stores, and coffee shops and is nicely lit up at night. I have been to many walking streets in China and I would rate this as",
          "Must be my 4th visit here and evening time with a visitor us the best time to visit. Sit by the street Tea store drink tea and watch the crowd go by itself is an experience. Than have dinner cum Chengdu folk show us a must. The famous Face Changing show us a must in Chengdu.",
          "Went here with friends & enjoyed the walk around the 'old style of Chengdu life' plenty of shops, restaurants and places of interest for all ages. Sample the local spicy dishes or drink tea & watch the world go by, very relaxing & enjoyable",
          "We came on a Sunday and it was really crowded - too crowded to be enjoyable. The area also seems very commercial. If you can, get out of Chengdu and visit an old town instead. We also visited Huanglongxi Ancient Town and it was much more enjoyable. We walked through this",
          "Another great place to visit in chengdu. One of the older parts of the city. Went and saw a show totally enjoyed this area . Like most of the old parts of chengdu it is full of gifts to buy and food to eat. History that you can't find anywhere else. Im definitely going back",
          "A authentic Chinese experience with some great buildings to see. We went on the weekend which is a busy time with lots of people mingling around",

          "There are endless shops some with cheap souvenirs and some with higher priced products. One point we didn't appreciate is that in all the shops, including the higher priced ones, you are unable to use your Visa or MasterCard. They only take Chinese credit cards. They are lots of",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control. The system was built by Libing and his son. The irrigation system prevents floods and droughts throughout the Plain of Chengdu.\n\n\n==== Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries ====\n\nCovering a total of 9,245 km2 (3,570 sq mi) over 12 distinct counties and 4 cities, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, lie on the transitional alp-canyon belt between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation. The Jinsha Relics Museum is located in the northwest of Chengdu, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from downtown. As a theme-park-style museum, it is for the protection, research, and display of Jinsha archaeological relics and findings. The museum covers 300,000 m2 (3,200,000 sq ft), and houses relics, exhibitions, and a conservation center.\n\n\n==== Golden Sun Bird ====\n\nThe Golden Sun Bird was excavated by archaeologists from the Jinsha Ruins on 25 February 2001. In 2005, it was designated as the official logo of Chinese cultural heritage by the China National Relic Bureau.\nThe round, foil plaque dates back to the ancient Shu area in 210 BC and is 94.2 percent pure gold and extremely thin. It contains four birds flying around the perimeter, representing the four seasons and directions. The sun-shaped cutout in the center contains 12 sunlight beams, representing the 12 months of a year. The exquisite design is remarkable for a 3,000-year-old piece.\n\n\n==== Sanxingdui Museum ====\nSituated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site, Sanxingdui Museum is 40 km (25 mi) north of Chengdu, covering a total area of 7,000 square metres (75,000 square feet).\nThe main collection highlights the Ancient City of Chengdu, Shu State & its culture, while displaying thousands of valuable relics including earthenware, jade wares, bone objects, gold wares, and bronzes that have been unearthed from Shang dynasty sacrificial sites.\n\n\n=== Buddhist and Taoist cultures ===\n\n\n==== Chengdu Daci Monastery ====\nKnown as the \"Nonpareil Monastery\" in China, the Daci Monastery in downtown Chengdu was first built during the Wei and Jin dynasties, with its cultural height during the Tang and Song dynasties. Xuanzang, an eminent Tang dynasty monk, was initiated into monkhood and studied for several years here; during this time, he gave frequent sermons in Daci Monastery.\n\n\n==== Wenshu Monastery ====\nAlso named Xinxiang Monastery, Wenshu Monastery is the best preserved Buddhist temple in Chengdu. Initially built during the Tang dynasty, it has a history dating back 1,300 years. Parts of Xuanzang's skull are held in consecration here (as a relic). The traditional home of scholar Li Wenjing is on the outskirts of the complex.\n\n\n==== Baoguang Monastery ====\nLocated in Xindu District, Baoguang (meaning divine light) Monastery enjoys a long history and a rich collection of relics. It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers. The lanes remained residential until 2003 when the local government turned the area into a mixed-use strip of restaurants, teahouses, bars, avant-garde galleries, and residential houses.\nHistoric architecture has been well preserved in the Wide and Narrow lanes.\n\n\n==== Jinli ====\nNearby Wuhou Shrine, Jinli is a popular commercial and dining area resembling the style of traditional architecture of western Sichuan. \"Jinli\" (\u9526\u91cc) is the name of an old street in Chengdu dating from the Han dynasty and means \"making perfection more perfect\".\nThe ancient Jinli Street was one of the oldest and the most commercialized streets in the history of the Shu state and was well known throughout the country during the Qin, Han and Three Kingdoms periods.\nMany aspects of the urban life of Chengdu are present in the current-day Jinli area: teahouses, restaurants, bars, theatres, handicraft stores, local snack vendors, and specialty shops.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Historic Town ====\nFacing the Jinjiang River to the east and leaning against Muma Mountain to the north, the ancient town of Huanglongxi is approximately 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Chengdu. It was a large military stronghold for the ancient Shu Kingdom. The head of the Shu Han State in the Three Kingdoms period was seated in Huanglongxi, and for some time, the general government offices for Renshou, Pengshan, and Huayang counties were also located here.\nThe ancient town has preserved the Qing dynasty architectural style, as seen in the design of its streets, shops, and buildings.\n\n\n==== Chunxi Road ====\nLocated in the center of downtown Chengdu, Chunxi Road (\u6625\u7199\u8def) is a trendy and bustling commercial strip with a long history. It was built in 1924 and was named after a part of the Tao Te Ching.\nToday, it is one of the most well-known and popular fashion and shopping centers of Chengdu, lined with shopping malls, luxury brand stores, and boutique shops.\n\n\n==== Anren Historic Town ====\nAnren Historic Town is located 39 km (24 mi) west of Chengdu. It was the hometown of Liu Wencai, a Qing dynasty warlord, landowner and millionaire. His 27 historic mansions have been well preserved and turned into museums. Three old streets built during the Republic of China period are still being used today by residents. Museums in Anren have a rich collection of more of than 8 million pieces of relics and artifacts. A museum dedicated to the memorial of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was built in 2010.\n\n\n==== Luodai Historic Town ====\nLuodai was built, like many historic structures in the area, during the period of the Three Kingdoms. According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China. Three or four hundred years ago, a group of Hakka people moved to Luodai from coastal cities. It has since grown into the largest community for Hakka people.\n\n\n==== Du Fu Thatched Cottage ====\nChinese name \u675c\u752b\u8349\u5802,24 acre, at the western outskirts of Chengdu, adjacent to the Huanhua Xi (Flower Rinsing Creek). Key buildings in the Du Fu Cao Tang Park were constructed in the early 16th century during the Ming dynasty and extensively renovated in 1811 during the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChina's state council has designated Chengdu as the country's western center of logistics, commerce, finance, science and technology, as well as a hub of transportation and communication. It is also an important base for manufacturing and agriculture.\nAccording to the World Bank's 2007 survey report on global investment environments, Chengdu was declared \"a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China\".Also based on a research report undertaken by the Nobel economics laureate, Dr. Robert Mundell and the celebrated Chinese economist, Li Yining, published by the State Information Center in 2010, Chengdu has become an \"engine\" of the Western Development Program, a benchmark city for investment environment in inland China, and a major leader in new urbanization.\nIn 2010, 12 of the Fortune 500 companies, including ANZ Bank, Nippon Steel Corporation, and Electricit\u00e9 de France, have opened offices, branches, or operation centers in Chengdu, the largest number in recent years. Meanwhile, the Fortune 500 companies that have opened offices in Chengdu, including JP Morgan Chase, Henkel, and GE, increased their investment and upgraded the involvement of their branches in Chengdu.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Leshan Giant Buddha (Chinese: \u4e50\u5c71\u5927\u4f5b) is a 71-metre (233 ft) tall stone statue, built between 713 and 803 (during the Tang dynasty), depicting Maitreya. It is carved out of a cliff face of Cretaceous red bed sandstones that lies at the confluence of the Min River and Dadu River in the southern part of Sichuan province in China, near the city of Leshan. The stone sculpture faces Mount Emei, with the rivers flowing below its feet. It is the largest and tallest stone Buddha statue in the world and it is by far the tallest pre-modern statue in the world.\nThe Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Leshan Giant Buddha is located at the Lingyun Mountain\u2019s Qifeng Peak. Qifeng Peak is located at the junction of the Minjiang River, Qingyi River, and Dadu River.Other than the Leshan Giant Buddha, the Danxia Landform also contains abundant history and cultural connotations, such as cliff tombs and cliff dwelling. The Mahao Cliff Tombs at the Leshan Giant Buddha scenic area were built in the Han Dynasty, indicating ancient local residents\u2019 living habits.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction started in 723 AD, led by a Chinese monk named Hai Tong. He hoped that the Buddha would calm the turbulent waters that plagued the shipping vessels traveling down the river. When funding for the project was threatened, he is said to have gouged out his own eyes to show his piety and sincerity. After his death, however, the construction was stuck due to insufficient funding. The statue was only completed from the shoulders up at the time. Several years later, Hai Tong\u2019s disciples continued work on the statue with financial support from a local official named Zhangchou Jianxiong. Hai Tong\u2019s disciples continued the construction until the Knees, when construction was halted because Zhangchou JianXiang was called to work at the royal court in Chang\u2019an. About 70 years later, jiedushi Wei Gao decided to sponsor the project and the construction was completed by Hai Tong's disciples in 803.\nBy the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Leshan Giant Buddha had been damaged -- the body was covered in moss, and the wooden pavilion had collapsed. During the reign of Song Renzong, the Giant Buddha was repaired once on a large scale and the wooden pavilion was rebuilt. Since then, the records of the destruction and reconstruction of the Buddha have been missing, and the original temple, Lingyun Temple, had been destroyed by war many times. \nApparently, the massive construction resulted in so much stone being removed from the cliff face and deposited into the river below that the currents were indeed altered by the statue, making the water safe for passing ships.A sophisticated drainage system was incorporated into the Leshan Giant Buddha when it was built. It is still in working order. It includes drainage pipes carved into various places on the body, to carry away the water after the rains so as to reduce weathering.\nWhen the Giant Buddha was carved, a huge thirteen story wood structure (similar to the one at the Rongxian Giant Buddha) was built to shelter it from rain and sunshine. This structure was destroyed and sacked by the Mongols during the wars at the end of the Yuan dynasty. From then on, the stone statue was exposed to the elements.\n\n\n== Degradation ==\nThe Leshan Buddha has been affected by the pollution emanating from the unbridled development in the region. According to Xinhua news agency, the Leshan Giant Buddha and many Chinese natural and cultural heritage sites in the region have seen degradations from weathering, air pollution, and swarms of tourists. The government has promised restoration work.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe entire art piece is built in stone, except for the ears that were designed in wood, covered with mud on the surface to make clay, and attached to the head. \n\n\n== Dimensions ==\nAt 71 metres (233 ft) tall, the statue depicts a seated Maitreya Buddha with his hands resting on his knees. His shoulders are 28 metres wide and his smallest toenail is large enough to easily accommodate a seated person. There is a local saying: \"The mountain is a Buddha and the Buddha is a mountain\". This is partially because the mountain range in which the Leshan Giant Buddha is located is thought to be shaped like a slumbering Buddha when seen from the river, with the Leshan Giant Buddha as its heart.\nThis 71-meters (233 ft) statue, carved in the Lingyun Mountain, is the biggest and tallest Buddha statue in the world. Leshan Giant Buddha\u2019s hair is composed of 1,021 spiraled curls embedded in his head that measures 14.7 meters (48 ft) in height and 10 meters (33 ft) in width. His ears, capable of holding two people inside, are 7-meters (23 ft) long. He has 5.6-meter (18 ft) long eyebrows, 8.3 meters (27 ft) long fingers, 24 meters (79 ft) wide shoulders, and a 5.6-meter (18 ft) long nose. His mouth and each of his eyes have a width of 3.3 meters (11 ft). His instep that is around 8.5 meters (28 ft) in width can hold about a hundred people and his smallest toenail can fit one seated person. This statue is ten stories high, which can be compared to the size of the Statue of Liberty if Buddha stood upright.  Buddha\u2019s body is placed in a symmetrical posture and the proportions of his various body parts are proportioned in accordance with the Buddharupa requirements of a statue. It has a calm form, which conforms to the Tang Dynasty statues\u2019 style .\n\n\n== Drainage System ==\nBehind the Buddha\u2019s head and between his two ears, the Leshan Giant Buddha has a unique and advanced drainage system to preserve the statue from erosion. There are several hidden gutters and channels scattered in Buddha\u2019s hair, collar, chest, and holes in the back of his ears and chest that have been carrying out the rainwater to keep the inner areas dry. This complex architectural system has been preventing the statue from eroding for the past 1,200 years.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nAfter the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Leshan Giant Buddha was designated as a cultural relic and put under protection by the Sichuan Provincial People\u2019s Committee in 1956. In 1996, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee included the Leshan Giant Buddha in the World Cultural and Natural Heritage List. In 1998, the Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area Management Committee was formally established. The management committee\u2019s scope of control reached 17.88 square kilometers. In 2008, the Mount Emei - Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area Management Committee was formally established, with the main task of developing tourism resources for Mount Emei and the Leshan Giant Buddha. On March 24, 2002, the first phase of the Leshan Giant Buddha repair project by the World Bank officially started. The project included completely renovating the Buddha from chest up to the head and then strengthening the rock wall. On June 23, 2002, the second phase of the Leshan Giant Buddha Maintenance Project started. During this phase, the rocks at the Buddha\u2019s feet were repaired and the eroded part of the rock below water level was repaired.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nBeing one of the six world cultural heritage sites in the Province of Sichuan, it receives a lot of tourist visits. From 2001-2003, it was ranked the second most popular attraction amongst the provincial heritage sites with 1.4 to 1.5 million visitors per year. In 2004, there was a breakthrough which led the numbers to drastically go up to 2.1 million visitors. From 2005-2007, it had around 2.3 to 2.8 million visitors per year, which was more than all the other sites .\nThe most convenient way to get to the Giant Buddha from Leshan Town is through the local bus 13. Upon arrival, it is necessary to purchase a ticket at the price of CNY 90 per person (including Wulong Temple & Mahao Cliff Tomb). The opening hours are 7:30am-6:30pm from April until October and 8:00am-5:30pm from October until March. The weekends and holidays are much busier compared to weekdays.\nApart from the main attraction, there are dozens of pathways throughout the mountain that can be explored by foot. \nPeople come from all over the world to worship Maitreya. To get a close-up view of him, there is a pedestrian pathway that allows visitors to appreciate the changing view of Buddha\u2019s body through multiple perspectives. It is important to note that the plank pathways there are steep and narrow. To get a more panoramic view of him, there are sightseeing boats available at the price of CNY 70 per person. Since these boats have a capacity of 35 passengers, there may be a waiting line.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBuddhist art\nChinese Buddhism\nList of statues by height\nTang Dynasty\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNESCO\nLeshan Grand Buddha - Da Fo",

          "Actually I prepared myself mentally that the Buddha will be very packed so I tried to avoid the crowds by starting very early at 7:30am when they opened the park. Luckily there were just a few people and I could enjoy the whole place. I have been to there between a regular",
          "We did a boat trip to see the giant Buddha. It was great to see it from a distance to take in the sheer size. This is a must when you\u2019re in the region",
          "We arrived early, and while there were still line ups to walk down to the bottom it was worthwhile. Judging by the gates for queuing people at busier times, it can be a lot busier! I highly recommend leaving yourself enough time to walk to the bottom as well as explore the",
          "We had an amazing visit to the famed Leshan Buddha last week. The immaculately maintained temples and breathtaking walk down the sheer steps from the Top of the Buddha to its base are a definite Sichuan highlight!",

          "We only saw the Buddha from above, which was a pretty good view. It appears you can hike down and get a view lower, but the the line was extremely long and viewing from above, it looked like a single path with a lot of people. The Buddha isn't the only tour sight to view. You",

          "If you have seen buddha's in SE Asia, you can give this one a miss. It was a long drive from Chengdu (2 hours) and one the fog lifted, it was a short speed boat ride down the river to the buddha carved into the side of the cliff. Maybe you have to do the land version and climb",
          "This was breathtaking! We were able to see the Buddha and witness a service in a temple. People take offerings: fruits, candy, flowers, etc. It\u2019s very nice to experience another culture.",
          "The site is a UNESCO Heritage spot and the ticket not cheap but worth for the marvellous Buddha. If you come here avoid the Chinese new year and national day ,then it won't be too crowded.",

          "When we were there it wasn't all that crowded, which was nice. The hike is not hard but I wouldn't recommend it to young children or elders. All in all it was a nice experience, might have been better if we were in a guided tour to learn a bit more on the background of this",
          "The Leshan Giant Buddha is a once in a life time experience. The whole park is amazing and worth walking through, the walk up to the top is not too difficult, when you are on top there is a beautiful temple to explore. Waiting to go down the stairs, next to the Buddha was a long",

          "The Leshan Buddha is very impressive however there is another part you can pay an extra 80\u00a5 for that is way more impressive, as there are caves and tombs with amazing wall carvings and statues inside. A lovely walk around, can easily get a train from Chengdu to Leshan and would",
          "Many people just take a boat across the river, climb the Giant Buddha in a line of people and return. They miss the best. Start on the land side at the East Gate and go through the Caves of a 1000 Buddhas. While the Giant is impressive, the Caves are filled literally with 1000's",

          "We took a bus from Chengdu to Leshan and then we took the local buses to get to the Buddha. We were going to take the boat to see it but after a miscommunication, we ended up hiking it. It took us 2 hours from the entrance to the base and back out. It is honestly really",
          "Just average and the place is quite small. if you do wanna visit this place, my advice is to take a boat. It's more convenient and could save your time as well. By the way, the local food in leshan is really good,you can't miss it.",
          "We climbed up. Instead of took the boat ride, because of the fog. But I'm glad we walked. Cos we were able to see the 1,300 year old sculptures along the way! Go with a guide, so you know about the history and the significance of the place, plus how cleverly the big buddha has",

          "I took my son to Chengdu for spring break. I decided to book this tour after reading the reviews. Our guide, Ivy met us promptly at our hotel. We took the Metro to the high speed train going to Leshan. The ride was comfortable. Ivy was very informative about the culture and",
          "We took the high speed train from Chengdu to Leshan (purchasing the tickets from in town the day before took about 40 mins with various translation apps and about 5 staff members - they were all doing their best but my almost non-existant mandarin made things pretty difficult",
          "Took the boat, it is a 10mn ride. View is probably the best. Unfortunately could not make the walk/trail with the he young kids but seemed awesome too though a bit crowded.",
          "Seriously people, make sure you are stair fit! The number of stairs at this attraction is incredible, and they are not even, or regular! After you buy your tickets, there is a pretty cruisey climb to the top of the Buddha. Along the way, there are a couple of places you can stop",
          "The enormity of the entire Budhha from head to toe is just not easy to explain in words. The Buddha site is a UNESCO heritage site and rightfully so. An hour's ride from Chengdu East Railway into the Leshan Railway station, this site is easily accessible from there through Bus",

          "Amazing Giant Buddha (Da Fo), the largest stone buddha in the world sitting at 72 metres. You can walk down from the Buddhas head down to Da Fo's feet. We got the fast train from Chengdu East to the Leshan station then the Number 3 bus to Leshan Giant Buddha. It was really easy.",
          "We made the 2.5-hour car ride from Chengdu City to Leshan to hike the Giant Buddha, which is 1300 years old and the largest sculpted Buddha in the world. We decided to hike the Buddha, rather than take the boat excursion to see it solely from the river bottom. I imagine the",
          "The Leshan Buddha was impressive. I did not do the climb, but rather chose to take the boat. With my terrible knees and Harris of lines, I'm glad I made this choice. I bought my train tickets through the Ctrip app and picked them up at the mostly deserted South Train station",
          "This makes a great day trip from Chengdu. We were in Chengdu to see the pandas (we booked the trip through China Highlights with Helen as our guide). We asked to have an extra day added to the trip to visit the giant Buddha. It was a perfect day. It's a long drive, but",
          "If you go to Chengdu make sure you make a detour to Leshan and the Giant Buddha carved into the rock formation. You will have to take a bus or a taxi from Chengdu and it will take you about 2 hours to get there and then it is another 10 minute boat ride to the Giant Buddha.",
          "2.5 hours drive from Chengdu. Took boat for half hour trip to see Giant Buddha from river as is the only way to see it in its entirety. Can climb up and over statue and visit other statues and shrines. Although not very far the sheer number of people meant the walk took 2.5",
          "I would recommend setting aside a full day for this trip, if you are doing it as a day trip from Chengdu. If you finish your sightseeing ahead of schedule, Leshan looks to be a pretty big town with plenty of restaurants and shops (albeit not right outside of the trains station).",
          "We decided to drive out to see the Leshan Giant Buddha in the afternoon after visiting the Chengdu Panda Center in the morning. The drive from Chengdu to Leshan is a bit long as you deal with traffic (2 1/2+ hours). I'd want to try the train next time (1 hour) but we had a tour",
          "The best way to visit Leshan Gian Buddha is to take fast train from Chengdu East station to Leshan Railway Station, and then change to city bus 3 to reach this site. Train takes around 1 hour and city bus - 1 hour one way as well. Buddha statue is really huge and worth a visit",

          "We went on a super rainy, slightly chilly day. The stairs really warmed us up though. There are some gentle stairs up to the head of the Buddha, and then you have the option of climbing down to the Buddha's feet, or staying at the top and just looking down. You don't need to go",
          "This is the biggest Buddha that I've seen in my life.It's also one of world heritage side by UNESCO.It's also very ancient.I wonder how they built it in the past.You don't need to go there by boat,but it requires a lot of walk and climb,good exercise ;)",
          "Beautiful sight and definitely worth the visit, some of the walkways nearby are a little tight which can be daunting when you've got pushy Chinese people in front and behind you though! But, its popular so it didnt surprise us that there would be large crowds!",
          "Leshan 50m high Buddha is the largest outdoor Buddha in china which was carved out of a hill. One can ride a boat to watch it from the boat or just to the Buddha and climb Up the side of Buddha. Definitely a must-see",
          "It's very very very nice! I went there in December, around 11:30 and we were only 20 people... I don't know if because it winter but was amazing! It's the only one reason to go in Chengdu, easy to take a train from Chengdu and then a bus and you are arrived! For lunch you",
          "Amazing feature, so big! The Oriental Buddha Park next to it is definitely worth a look too, huge caves full of impressive statues and carvings. But disappointed that you have to pay extra to go into see Leshan Great Buddha, misleading when you enter the Oriental Park - 80rmb to",
          "I had one day off in Chengdu and went to visit the Giant Buddha in Leshan - the weather decided to cooperate and we actually saw the sun for the first time this week. The two hour car ride was uneventful and there isn't much to see on the road between Chengdu and the famous",

          "Traveling by bus, its take about 2 and half hours to reach destination and totally worth it. Other option is the speed train ( 1 hour trip) . Take few step up to the hill ( 333 step to be exact) , along the way some story hidden behind the mountain. Once you reach, the big",
          "Leshan giant buddha is one of the world heritage - unesco site. I should take small boat (ferry) to get across the river to see the giant Buddha. The tour itself only took 45 minutes. If u already arrive in leshan, u should see this tourism site",

          "It's definitely worth the trip, very impressive! We went in December for Christmas holiday so we thought we beat the crowds but it was still somewhat crowded. Fun trip! I recommend you bring comfortable shoes since there are a lot of stairs, despite the fact that the lady in",
          "Very impressive site, but can be very crowded. Besides the Buddha itself the rest of the park is worth visiting, especially the Lingbao pagoda from the Tang Dynasty. For the best views do a boat trip",
          "Worth the trip we took from emeishan to Leshan by van. Its about an hour drive. We paid 20 rmb per person. If you booked the whole van they will charge you 100 rmb. Then we took the boat ride for 70 rmb per person. Its bring you right to the foot of the giant buddha. Lovely",
          "I made the hike out to leshan one afternoon and really enjoyed it. He is impressively big and carved into a wall of rock that looks over a river and the city of leshan. Built 1300 years ago, this is quite the achievement. There are a host of other night monasteries and carvings",
          "If you visit this location in high season, you will get a 1-1.5 hour queue. But if you have time, this is worth to see. Not really suitable for small child. Hidden treasure, there is several other giant Budha status in the complex, but there all inside caves, not many people",
          "We took the boat trip since after reading reviews we wanted to see the whole Buddha. This has been on my bucket list for a while and just didn't live up to the pictures I had seen. Glad I went and I'm not wondering about it.",
          "The giant buddha in Leshan was a great way to spend a day. It is HUGE and yes, it is as big and impressive as you might expect. Except for the rumour I heard that you could play a game of basketball on it's shoulder! That's a stretch. I would suggest going on a weekday where the",
          "Waaaaaaaay to crowded. Really not worth the effort since there is nothing else to see besides the Buddha. The hike up the mountain could of been cool if it weren't for all the tour groups with guides yelling through megaphones. The descend down the side of the Buddha was",
          "Magnificent image of the Buddha carved on the LeShan mountain, definitely worth the walk down and up the sides of the mountain. Do take care because the steps can be quite steep and it can be very crowded. I visited on a Sunday afternoon and I toured the other section with other",
          "Leshan Giant Buddha is really impressive to see, both from the top and from the bottom. Be patiente though, as the crowd of tourists is not the fastest in the stairs. But it really is worth it! We spend the day there and arrived very early but this way we manage to avoid a",
          "It's Amazing Place, beautiful too. I went there by myself from chengdu, I take CRH from Chengdu to Leshan around 1 hour then take the bus No.3 around 40 mins to Giant Buddha (East gate, ticket gate) it was very easy. (When you out of Leshan Railway station, please see the right",

          "Just how they carved out this gigantic Buddha is amazing. It's really a piece of Art and so much ingenuity. It's really worth going and very easy to go there from Chengdu. It could be crowded during holidays and weekend so better go during the week.",
          "This is just an amazing wonder of gigantic proportions. The giant stone sculpture faces Mount Emei, and two rivers join to flow below his feet. It is the largest stone Buddha in the world and it reputed to be the tallest pre-modern statue in the world. This is a UNESCO World",
          "It's really worth seeing. Very easy to get there and to walk around. My advice: go there from Monday to Thursday. We went there on Monday and there were hardly any people. Everything was great. You don't need to walk a lot - it's quite fast and easy to get around. However, if",
          "The humongous sitting Buddha carving is a very magnificent piece of history and artwork. It makes one wonder how the people at that time were able to complete such a feat carving it out from n the cliff. Walking up to the top of the hill was not that bad. Along the way,",
          "Take a high speed train and it takes around 1hour to travel from Chengdu. the big buddha is located around 20mins taxi journey from the train station. and try to go early to avoid the crowd. it will be crowded by 10-11am.",
          "I went there with my friends and we had a great time there. I have to say with the mysterious tales about Buddha, I felt the power of religion. The sculpture of the Buddha is really remarkable and I couldn\u2019t help respecting the ancient people who built such an impossible work.",
          "Took a boat to view this ancient works. The Buddha was at least 18 storey high. Couldn't believe how this could be done in the ancient days. If u take a boat, u are able to see the full view of the Buddha and they also offer to take pics for u of cost at rmb20 each. Be careful",
          "You can either hike up the hill or take a boat tour to see the Giant Buddha. It is remarkable piece of work. From the boat you can get a good view of the area. A pity we couldn't hike up the hill due to time constraint",
          "Recommend the boat trip to see it from the water - that way you can see the full scale of it. There are also other carvings in the rock around it that can only be seen from the water. It is also possible to walk down many steps to the Buddha's feet and then back up as many",
          "Really love the day here. It's not even a hike to get up there so don't be put off. The buddha itself is amazing and really awe inspiring. We got there early so avoided some of the queues of pushing chinese tourists!! They can take the edge off a little but it is still a",
          "We took a short excursion to see the Giant Buddha on our tour. It was an OK visit being on the boat and glad that we were not hiking up and down on the sides of the cliff. The boat ride was about 30 minutes from beginning to end with many other tourists, not just from our group.",
          "Worth all the stairs to see the Giant Buddha from the bottom, we went on the boat as well, just different aspects. I can see why the river currents changed with all the rubble the carving of the Buddha created.",
          "It was a long drive from Chengdu to Leshan to visit the Giant Buddha. Since we try to catch a flight in the afternoon to go to Jiuzhaigou, we only took the boat ride to see the Buddha. It is very tall, so you can only take pictures from the boat. If you decide to climb to the",
          "Another amazing construction made by the ancient chineses. You can choose between going by foot or by boat. We choosen going by foot and visit the whole park, which has some small temples apart from the Giant Buddha. It is a huge statue, really impressive and well preserved",

          "Originally I planned to visit Leshan by myself. Our tour had a free day in Chengdu. Somehow my secret leaked out and the whole group came along. Everyone happy to make the side trip. Very impressive. The local guide was \" forced upon\" us. Because of the local guide we had to see",
          "Humongous up close! Pretty amazing sight! Cant believe it only took people less than 100 years to complete!",
          "Best way to view the Buddha is by boat - which leave from the banks across from the Buddha on regular intervals. Lunch is easily bought at Leshan from where the boats depart. Later by road you can travel across to the other side of the river and climb up a well laid path to",
          "It's certainly big & impressive to see. If you go to walk past it the queues are horrendous though might be avoided if arriving later in the afternoon (after 3:30). A boat would give a good view from afar if a photo is all you want.",
          "This 71-metre tall stone Buddha statue is a very impressive, and I understand it to be the world\u2019s largest stone Buddha. Construction took place in the Tang Dynasty between 713 and 803. It was carved out of the cliff. The construction project was planned by a monk by the name of",

          "Definately do not miss out on a chance to see the great buddha and the nearby caves. Make sure you go plenty early and out of season if possible. Don't use the tour guides as they tend to speak no English and you don't get the full value and are still expected to follow the",
          "We hired a car with driver for around RMB700 and start our journey around 8.00am. It took us more than 3 hours. At first, we plan to cover both, by climbing the stairs and by boat. However, it was very crowded when we were there so we decided to skip the climbing and went for",
          "Possibly my favorite place in Sichuan, even while fighting all the tourists. The magnitude of this statue is not easily realized, you have to really think about HOW HUGE it really is to understand. To do this I would recommend the boat tour. Yes it is an additional 70Y but",
          "We stayed in Chengdu and a relative offered to take us to Leshan to visit the Giant Buddha. Despite 3 plus hours in traffic to get there, it was well worth it. Pictures really don't reflect how big this Buddha is! You take steep stairs down one side of the cliff to get to the",
          "Really enjoyed my time there as we spent most of the day in the area. I would adviced to go enter the park after lunch time as it's pretty crowded before and most of the groups are gone after (a chinese guide told me they combine Leshan Buddha with Emeishan). If you are",
          "I visited on a murky day and saw by lake - the boat journey was just 15 minutes but got good unobstructed view - not sure what it would be like on holiday season or weekend - worth a visit",
          "Happily, there were no queues when we arrived at around 9:45am (late September). We took the 8am bus from Baoguo Station in Emei (\u00a511), which takes an hour. The number 13 city bus leaves from outside the bus station (nearside of the road) and takes about 40 minutes to reach the",

          "There are two ways to see the giant Buddha. First option is to walk down very steep stairs, lots of very steep stairs, or to take a boat. If you have any issues with heights, then definitely avoid the steps. The boat gives you a much better view and only costs a few dollars.",
          "When you get there go straight to the line to see the giant Buddha, because this could take a while if it's crowded. After that explore the rest of the park, very beautiful, nice pictures, temples. You can spend from 2 to 5 hours. It will depend on how much you want to see and",
          "If you have the time, definitely come and see the Big Buddha in Leshan - it's pretty spectacular. The path to climb down is quite narrow with large steps and a few viewing platforms along the way. We were lucky and did not have to wait very long to climb down to the Buddha's",
          "We visited in mid September 2016, felt the Leshan Giant Buddha was definitely worth a day trip out of Chengdu. We hired a taxi for the day from Chengdu, cost us rmb850. It's approximately 2.5 hour drive from Chengdu to Leshan without traffic. We left Chengdu at 7:30, reached",
          "We visit the giant buddha from Chengdu. Left Chengdu at 09:30 am by train and arrived after a claustrophobic bus ride at the sight at 11:55 am. Bought tickets and climbed the stairs to the head of the Buddha. There was a surprise; the waiting line for the path & boat ride was",
          "Amazing sight. Expect to wait in a queue for at least 2 hours. Many steps to walk down then up. I would recommend the boat option if you don't like waiting or have trouble with walking up and down steps.",

          "Not really into these sorts of monuments , but it was part of a tour and the 2 hour coach drive from Chengdu was interesting. Used the opportunity to see the Buddha from the boat , which is probably the best option.",
          "Definitely come to see this attraction, but do it right. The 90 RMB entry for the Buddha is a waste. It looks most impressive from the bottom, and you have to stand in a miserable queue to walk down and view it from there. Pay 70 RMB for the cruise and see it from the river",
          "Travelled from Chengdu by train. You can get there either from Chengdu East (Line 2) or Chengdu South (Line 1) stations. The latter was quiet when we went on a Tuesday outside of rush hour. Cost was 51RMB per person. You can find train times on travelchinaguide.com &",
          "Ok I have to admit that I was very skeptical about this place before I went there. I thought it would be another tourist trap but I was wrong. The giant Buddha is amazing but what I found even more amazing was the trail leading up to the Buddha, which featured beautiful caves",

          "When we saw the long queu to climb down from the head to the feet of the Buddha I thought I was throwing away the little time I had to explore Leshan but I was wrong. The steps are narrow and clinged on the cliff with the river at your feet. View are amazing both towards Giant",
          "It's so amazing to think that one man (Haitong the sculptor and monk) came up with the idea to sculpt this work of art into this fabulous red sandstone. It is quite breathtaking and the best way to see this fabulous Buddha is definitely from the river boat which you can get",
          "Very impressive, giant stone Buddha. Also the temple is very nice. The place is very crowded. Expect long queues if you want to go down to the feet of the Buddha. Maybe it's worth to have a look from a boat on the river.",
          "Giant Buddha very impressive ! It took us almost 2 hour in queue to see giant Buddha from top to the bottom it was totally worth to be in queue ...the view form top to bottom is awesome we took lot of beautiful pictures , was very much impressed the it was build by monk thousand",
          "The Buddha is a steep decent down and a big climb up the mountains either side however it was worth it, not only for the views of the Buddha on the way down but also to look up and see how big it actually is at the bottom! The park also has many other Buddhas to look at in",
          "If you are in Chengdu this is a fantastic day trip! It's a few hours drive so get an early start. The Buddha at Le Shan is massive. It is said that it was built by a monk to appease the gods, who kept flooding the area and killing many people. Today it is unknown if the",
          "He\u2019s big and certainly special but the park, including the massive buddhas in caves (one in the cave of 1000 buddhas) are also amazing. For me, they were the highlight. There is a bit of walking and climbing involved but its relatively gentle and there are refreshments and",
          "The giant buddha itself is pretty amazing, and worth the long queue (it actually moved pretty quickly anyway). I was worried that there wouldn't be anything else to do here, but the surroundings are beautiful and lovely to walk around, and there are lots of other buddha-related",
          "The Budha statue is really impressive and worth of visit. But may be is better to take one of the frequent boats to see it from the river then stand really long queue in the park. We spent there 1 hour and 40 minutes right after noon, when there was 36 degrees in shadow, so make",
          "A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is an attraction not to be missed. The largest stone Buddha in the world said to be 71 meters tall and 28 meters wide. At such humongous size, I believe it is best admired from a distance. We opted for the boat ride rather than the steep climb",
          "Visited the site on the last day of a trip to Chengdu to see the pandas, and was highly disappointed. It was crowded and the queue to descend the stairs was over 2 hours long. It's a 1+ hour train ride from the city, then a bus ride to the mountain. Saw the Buddha for a few",
          "The best time to go there is 4pm. We were almost alone. Perfect for picture and to appreciate the place with out a massive crowd by your side. I will recommend this place to anyone that come to Chengdu or Leshan. We paid 1yen the bus to get there from Lesham main bus station",
          "This is a must do from the boat and walking up. Look at it first from the boat to get perspective and then look at it from the top. We did not go down till the legs as there was a huge line but from the top itself it looked amazing. We did several other of the temples around",
          "We just take a 30minutes rivercruise...the weather was a bit hot but it was worth the heat. The Giant Buddha statue was huge and beautiful...signs of ancient and the magnitude of buddhism can be felt throughout the journey. We took several full body of the Buddha...we didnt",
          "My tour operator took us on a short cruise on the river to see the giant buddha. It is probably the best option if you'd like to take a picture of yourself and the whole of the buddha statue (I don't think you can do it if you stand right below the statue). The boat will stop in",
          "This was our first day of our holiday so we were probably niaeve but the taxi driver didn't take us to the Buddha but to the other side of the water - where we got a ferry at an extortionate rate that simply drove over to the Buddha and dropped its anchor. Not a massive tourist",
          "The unfortunate thing was that we kinda came 2.5 hours before closing and were rushing through everything, but the advantage was that it was a weekday and there were no lines at all to see the giant buddha. You could go downstairs at your own pace. As much as I have heard the",
          "As I saw, from morning to approx 2:00pm there have hugh people means you need to queue approx 1~2 hours for climb down to Buddha's feet( it was created from the mountain). You will climb up to top of the mountain as the Buddha's head; then climb down as Buddha's feet to view",
          "It was quite a drive out of Chengdu but well worth it. The enormity of it is quite staggering. As my wife is disabled we only took the boat trip.",
          "We travelled from Chengdu East Railway station to Leshan on the high speed train. It took just 1 hour! A one way ticket for first class travel cost us approx. RMB65 per person. The train also has a second class option (roughly RMB55 per person) and a business class option",
          "We started our trip with a short river cruise to view the buddha from the river which was impressive and you can get an appreciation of the size and the cliff walkway. Later we climbed to the top, an easy wander with lots of easy steps. He is big! Great monestry and temple at",
          "The Buddha was quite spectacular. There are also temples and gardens but the Buddha alone is already worth paying a visit if you happen to pass Leshan on your way to Emeishan. A Hong Kong movie had a scene shot here, so it had a bit more significance to me but I am sure others",
          "The park is huge and beautiful. The buddha is the most impressive sculpture I've ever seen, worth the visit. Inside the park are lots of food stands, with beverages, icecreams and low quality food. It's like an amusement park. The only problem is that there's a 2h queue inside",
          "The statue of the Giant Buddha is quite impressive, standing on a rock in Leshan. The place is very nice but crammed with local tourists all the time. At 90yuan is ok for the normal prices. There are interesting areas around the south entrance without so many tourists. It is ok",
          "I expected a bit more wow from Leshan. The giant buddha is quite impressive, especially the giant hands and feet! If you go, go early. We arrived at the buddha at about 9.30am and there were very small queues. Whilst there are other things to see in the park it feels quite",

          "We took a very small boat ride to get to this ancient wonder. To think something this old has stood the test of time out in the weather. There is another way to visit this Buddha and that's via a great big climb, glad we went by boat. Totally worth having a look at",
          "Le Shan Giant Buddha is really impressive. Carved during the Tang dynasty more than 1000 years ago. Best view from the cruise ride from the river. The closer you get to the Buddha, the more impressive it looks. There are stairways to climb up the structure behind the giant",
          "I took a plane to Chengdu and a bullet train to Leshan and spent one night here (FODI Inn) just to visit Da Fo. It was totally worth the travels to see this in person. I arrived at the Leshan train station around 3:30 because of flight delays, so I went straight to the site.",
          "Of course the enormous stone Buddha (tallest statue until the 20th Century!) and its history are really spectacular, but the area includes some other interesting sights that you should make time for. Mt. Lingyun and Mt. Wuyuo are joined by the Haoshang Bridge and a network of",
          "There are two ways to visit this place - from the river or by foot. We took the cruise and swing over to side of the mountain. The trip is about 30 to 45 minutes. Do wear the lifejacket. Take the top level of the boat since that is the best place to take pictures. Don't forget",
          "We stopped here in our way back from Mount Emei to ChengDu. 1 hour is enough time for you to take the boat and get the pictures. The boat ride takes less than 30 min and costs RMB 70",
          "We went here for a day trip from Chengdu. The lines are super long, but as the largest standing pre-modern structure, it is quite impressive! Head through the entire park, check out the different stones with large red calligraphy, enjoy the views from the face of mount emei",
          "Yeah it's a massive Buddha. If you are in the area it's worth a stop for an hour or so to take some pics and then you can say you saw the tallest Buddha in the world. If you are not already in the area it may not be worth going out of your way to see it. It's a good detour if",
          "The place is beautiful: nature and construction-wise. The remains of the structures throughout the park and the Giant Buddha itself is a great daytrip. It's only a shame that almost nobody takes it as it is - a spiritual spot.",

          "We caught the ferry as we were short on time. 70 CNY, and about 30mins. But you see the impressive Buddha from the water which allows for good views. The walk also looked good. But I was happy with my boat trip",

          "This attraction is about an hour and a half from Chengdu and is well worth the visit. I did not attempt to take the crowded walk down to the foot of the Buddha, but enjoyed a leisurely cruise on the boat to get a great view of this amazing Buddha. The cruise itself is no more",

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern schlars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km^2 area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts, 5 county-level cities and 5 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot Pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city.

The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China.

        "wiki": "The Tea Horse Road or chamadao (simplified Chinese: \u8336\u9a6c\u9053; traditional Chinese: \u8336\u99ac\u9053), now generally referred to as the Ancient Tea Horse Road or chamagudao (simplified Chinese: \u8336\u9a6c\u53e4\u9053; traditional Chinese: \u8336\u99ac\u53e4\u9053) was a network of caravan paths winding through the mountains of Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet in Southwest China. This was also a tea trade route. It is also sometimes referred to as the Southern Silk Road or Southwest Silk Road, and it is part of a complex routes system connecting China and South Asia.\nThere are numerous surviving archaeological and monumental elements, including trails, bridges, way stations, market towns, palaces, staging posts, shrines and temples along the route. Besides the route's importance for commercial activity, more significantly it was crucial for cultural exchange between the Indian subcontinent, Tibet and Southwest China. Especially, it was vitally important for the interchange of Buddhism between China and South Asia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSichuan and Yunnan are believed to be the first tea-producing regions in the world. The first record of tea cultivation in the world suggested that tea was cultivated on Sichuan's Mount Mengding (\u8499\u9876\u5c71) between Chengdu and Ya'an earlier than 65 BC. Ya'an has been an important hub of tea trading till the 20th century. Besides tea, silk products from Chengdu, notably Shujin (\u8700\u9526), was also traded through this road to South Asian from around 2000 years ago.\nFrom around a thousand years ago, the Tea Horse Road was a trade link from Yunnan to Bengal via Myanmar; to Tibet; and to Central China via Sichuan Province. In addition to tea, the mule caravans carried salt. Both people and horses carried heavy loads, the tea porters sometimes carrying over 60\u201390 kg (132-198 lb.), which was often more than their own body weight in tea. The porters carried metal-tipped staffs, both for balance while walking and to help support the load while they rested, so they didn't need to lay the bales down (as illustrated in the photo).\nIt is believed that it was through this trading network that tea (typically tea bricks) first spread across China and Asia from its origins in Pu'er county, near Simao Prefecture in Yunnan.The route earned the name Tea-Horse Road because of the common trade of Tibetan ponies for Chinese tea, a practice dating back at least to the Song dynasty, when the sturdy horses were important for China to fight warring nomads in the north.\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn the 21st century, the legacy of the Tea-Horse Road has been used to promote a railway that will connect Chengdu to Lhasa. This planned railroad, part of the PRC's 13th 5-Year Plan, is called the Sichuan-Tibet railway (\u5ddd\u85cf\u94c1\u8def); it will connect cities across the route including Kangding. Authorities claim it will bring great benefit to the people's welfare.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTea\nPu-erh tea\nMengding Ganlu tea\nShaxi, Yunnan, a well-preserved historical trading town in Jianchuan County on the ancient tea route\nSiberian Route\nSilk Road\nJeff Fuchs,  the first westerner to walk the entire road\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nForbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011).

          "Very convenient to get there through public transport. Take a train and then switch to a bus to get to the entrance. The place is quite big and it will take at least half a day to explore. Cuteness overload here with so many pandas around. The baby pandas are especially cute and",
          "Worth the visit, have seen lots of Pandas playing, relaxing and eating. Have seen a baby panda. Best maintained panda center with a world class research center. Good views of the city from the park.",
          "Go early in the morning to miss the crowds, and also see the panda's at their most active. Easy to take a taxi form the city centre - not expensive and no need to queue up for buses etc.",
          "Had a lovely morning visit here with our guide. There were pandas everywhere and it was lovely to be able to see the newborns. The place covers a large area, but it was very crowded with tourists",
          "The weather was perfect and the Pandas including the Red Pandas were all in an active mood and made it interesting and entertaining",
          "This is a beautiful park with beautiful pandas of every ages, beginning from baby pandas to elder ones. You can watch them eating bambu or playing with their friends. There is a shop at the entrance which you can find many kinds of souvenirs. I recommend everbody to visit this",
          "Well worth a visit, the base opens at 7:30am so arrive as early as possible to get the most out of it.",
          "It is a must do when visiting Chengdu! We caught a 'DiDi' straight from our hotel in the morning. From reviews we got there about 8:30am. We bought tickets at the ticket office out the front. Upon entering we did not realise how large it was. We walked all the way to the back of",
          "I would personally recommend this to anyone visiting Chengdu, this place is huge so do allow a few hours to have a good walk around. there is a lot to see and it's a very calming and relaxing place to be.",
          "It's a giant 'zoo' for viewing giant panda and the small red panda. We had a very good time observing giant panda, taking pictures and video taping them. Go to the base in the early morning when the pandas are fed. We spent about two hours there easily. It was well worth the",
          "It's big, like a normal zoo but very different in that there is only one animal. Actually there are two, the Red Panda and the Giant Panda. Red panda only have a couple of pens and they are smaller and more elusive. There are Pandas everywhere! Just look for a crowd of people",
          "We arrived there (with our tickets) and they would not recognise them. Said we booked for the wrong date (we didn't). Because of limited English/Mandarin done via translator we decided to pay for new tickets. They told us to cancel the TripAdvisor tickets. We did but no refund",
          "During return flight from australia we had 10.5 hours of transit in Chengdu airport - 0540 am to 04:15 pm. with our experience at Beijing layover we waned to make use of this time and definitely dont want to visit and see Pandas in China. Getting transit visa if your nationality",
          "What a life, sleeping, eating and sleeping. This was a highlight and you can get so close, but bware the rude Chinese who are experts with their elbows at getting to the front. Saw the very young baby pandas just because my elbows are bigger than most",
          "We went on this tour today and had a great experience. Our tour guide, Hayley, was very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. She expertly guided us through the park and helped us get the best pictures possible all while sharing a lot of information about the pandas and expertly",
          "Cute animals alert! Even though the crowd made it hard for us to see the pandas up close, and the distance was quite far, but it was a nice experience. Should have came earlier when the pandas are still active! Just wished they would let us take a peek inside the room for the",
          "Opens 730am. Be there before 11am as they are most active in the morning. Spend abt 3 hrs here. Take MRT to Panda Avenue station. Panda Shuttle buses will b waiting outside. Buy tickets from the authorised ticketing staff near or in the buses. DO NOT buy from the people right",
          "I visited here was a friend late September and i loved the whole experience. I was worried that it would be too busy and we wouldnt see many pandas but we saw so many and it did get busy but we made sure to arrive very early to avoid most of the crowds. We planned to go on a",
          "This was definitely worth a visit. A group of my friends and I traveled from Guangzhou to Chengdu. We went right away in the morning and it seemed like we had the whole park to ourselves. We saw so many active pandas playing and eating. We also saw them sleeping. There were also",
          "Get there at exactly 0730 to be able to get on the open air tour trolly. Dress warm. Eat before you go, there is food available, but not very good.",
          "Great place, its incredible to see the pandas here. They look very relaxed. The baby area is particularly favourite with the visitors. This place gets pretty busy but if your patient enough you really enjoy the peace of the gardens.",
          "When in Chengdu, you can't miss the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base. Book a Day Tour to avoid long queue.",
          "This was a place where Pandas live. But i find it over-rated. There are a number of things that this park needs to improve on. Firstly, this place certainly needs more big proper walking paths for pedestrians. We paid additional money on top of the attraction ticket prices for",
          "A sensational location to observe Pandas. They are not in their natural environment, but they look happy. The location is also very beautiful, with nice gardens.",
          "The research base has very lovely grounds - bamboo forests, waterfalls, stone paths. The pandas like them too, so much so that they hide in them all day. Pandas find a comfortable position and stay in one spot apparently until it is time to eat. It's hard to spot them amongst",
          "We did expect more kind of a zoo, but this Pandas seem to live in paradise in Chengdu. They have big enclosures and a huge area to roam around and therefore they seem to be happy. We arrived at 10:30am and still there were most of them very active, playing and eating, sure some",
          "I guess this is one of the only places on Earth, one can see a baby panda within a metre (separated by glass). Super adorable. BUT!!!! ... To avoid the crowd, we reached the Park at 8am and at the Nursery Compound, the visitors traffic is still bad ... literally being pushed",
          "Came here as part of a tour. Really crowded and most of the pandas were asleep so did not see much activity. Saw red pandas too which was great.",
          "We were transiting through Chengdu and decided to use the wait to see the pandas. One hour and half to two are sufficient to see the whole base. It is organized very well and the grounds are well suited to showcase the pandas. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that",
          "A must place to visit when you\u2019re in Chengdu. If you\u2019re lucky you might be able to catch a baby panda. They\u2019re just so adorable.",
          "We are DIY travellers--don't like tours---and also not morning people. When I read that you better be there at the crack of dawn to see anything, that didn't sit well. So instead we decided to take a chance and go in the afternoon--we left our hotel (Sofitel) about 1:30pm. We",
          "It was the very reason we come to Chengdu. A taxi ride from our hotel was reasonable in cost. The real beauty was the free entry to the base as both of us are over certain age. You do need to be able to walk up hill a little. We toured the base back to front by seeing the",
          "We were on a guided tour having travelled from England. Arrived early but there were already a lot of people at the centre. Easy to get in and saw our first panda within minutes of arriving. It was a bit crowded at most viewing areas (4-5 people deep in places). The pandas",
          "Chengdu is the hometown of giant pandas. This is our first visit to Chengdu. It was so interesting to see the Panda while asleep. None of them were playing. The red panda was in active mode. The Research Base is like a park. It was large and like a tropical rainforest. the",
          "It was wonderful to see the pandas so close up. Get there early - we got there just after 8am - as they are active after their breakfast but then head off for their nap. It was lovely to see a couple of adolescent pandas tumbling around together, pulling on each other's ears",
          "It's much better than a city zoo or circus, and we did not see the entire grounds, and true Pandas are more endangered and unique than typical farms animals, but I still felt sort of sorry for the Pandas. The animals I saw are still surrounded by discreetly hidden electric",
          "The Panda research base is excellent. It is quite an extensive site and involves a lot of walking sometimes on an incline. You can however take transport form the entrance to the base. There are both Giant and Red Pandas to see and they are housed in large compounds with large",
          "This is a beautiful park environment. If possible, pick a cool weather day to visit so the pandas are active. It was lovely to see them moving about and younger ones playing together in the trees! There was a large crowd to view the baby pandas (one in an incubator and one in a",
          "Although on a reserve it is also a major research centre for this endangered species. Surprisingly it is just on the Edge of a get large city. Be prepared for a lengthy walk around the reserve and it is quite hilly in places but there Are transport available. You will never get",
          "Err interesting. A must see when visiting Chengdu. In addition, the park where the Panda Center is located is quite beautiful and worth walking through.",
          "The Giant Panda Research Base is amazing but get there by 7.30. We caught a metro to the Panda Avenue stop and caught a taxi for 20 yuan to the Panda Base. Couldn't see the buses as it was dark. Arrived 7.15am at Panda Base. Stood in line for tickets - no issue buying tickets",
          "An overcast early morning allowed us to see the Pandas feeding. They feed with their backs to you, not interested in your attempts to photograph them. Maybe due to the weather, the crowds were tolerable . Only 8,00 people shuffling about. But in the incubators, the crowds were",
          "It was lovely to see the pandas and to view, briefly, the babies. The worst thing we're the queues of people, so it took a long time to view very little. The paths are no good for pushchairs and wheelchairs, as there are steps and also trees in the middle of the paths, no",
          "A very well frequented preserve. Try to be there early. It seems to get very crowded any day of the week. Nice grounds with many opportunities to see all varieties of Pandas. It does involve quite a bit of walking. It is hard to get a taxi for the return trip. Do not be shy to",
          "In a land of amazing things to see, the Giant Panda Research base holds its own. Literally hundreds of pandas from tiny babies to juveniles to adults all existing in natural conditions wherever possible. It literally blows your mind to see how they are cared for and enabled to",
          "Situated a reasonably short drive from Chengdu proper the center is well laid out and offers great views of all the Pandas large and small and provides very informative vignettes on their life and the work of the people operating the center. Recommend getting their after the",
          "Pandas are amazing, you do need to go early so that you can catch them having their breakfast as after that they do not do very much. Me and my boyfriend were very lucky, nearly all the tourists had gone so we decided to have another little walk around and we were able to watch",
          "Seeing this facility was a dream of mine and it didn't disappoint. Loved viewing the pandas outside being as active as pandas can be! The local people need to be more considerate of visitors and not spend so much time taking selfies. A must visit when in Chengdu.",
          "Its a Panda Theme Park. Very well oiled to handle crowd. The only exception is a tiny space to see baby panda. Not nice to be indoors with loud speakers. Do go as early as possible. We were there around 10am. The stars had their breakfast and were all digesting the bamboo in",
          "This centre is beautiful, full of vegetation and in a clean setting for watching the pandas, but it's imperative to be there early as it's a very busy place and the crowds gather where you can see the pandas to a point that viewing is impossible. The cafe offers very good lunch",
          "This is just a beautiful place-and the Pandas are amazing, go early so that you can catch them having their breakfast, because after that they just laze around and don\u2019t do much. Go and see the babies in the enclosed area they are like big fluffy balls. Also visit the red Pandas",
          "Started the day early arriving at the breeding Center at about 8am by taxi which was only about \u00a312 for a 30 min drive, the cost for admission surprised me at only \u00a36.00 entry. I looked online at an organised trip that would have cost about \u00a3112.00 The place is remarkable, all",
          "Think huge safari park, zoo, and research facility dedicated to pandas. Our visit exceeded our expectations. First the place is huge. We walked 4.5 miles throughout the park and still didn\u2019t visit all of the exhibits. They do have a shuttle, but the queue is always long and",
          "We were visited on cool Sunday afternoon in November, and were delighted by many very active pandas, even the red ones! Many reviews said to go in the early morning to see the pandas active, but we think that since it was a pretty cool day, they were keen to move about in the",
          "Seeing the pandas is an awesome experience and outweighs the challenges with crowd management which are especially severe in the nursery areas. Suggestion is to get there early and spend half the day so you can see the pandas when they are active as well as appreciate the",
          "Thanks to the helpful TripAdvisor community, we understood that the earlier you go the better the experience as the pandas are more active and there'll be less crowds. We used Trip dot com to buy tickets online, it was very simple and useful; once purchased (no extra fees)",
          "Yes, this place gets crowded (primarily busloads of Chinese and European tourists), but you can still see quite a number of pandas, including babies in the \"nursery\" as well as the red pandas. We saw probably 25 or so large pandas during our walk-through (it was WAY too crowded",
          "Because it is so close to the city the Chengdu Panda Base has a zoo-like atmosphere with hundreds of visitors everywhere. Some young adult pandas were able to be viewed in trees, providing realistic images of their lives. They were, however, a fair distance from the perimeter",
          "The pandas are ever so cute, but oh so lazy. In fact so lazy that they will not hunt for food. They eat 12 hours a day, sleep for 10 and play for two. Once they are done eating, well forget about it, they will lie down with their backs towards you. Forget about getting any",
          "Pandas are cute and it's a must visit in Chengdu but this place seriously needs some crowd control. We went there early in the morning and it was already crowded with people (mainly tours). There were lines at the entrance but people were actually queuing up. We thought they",
          "I've been planning to come to China and everyone asked me why...my one word answer...\"panda's!\" This place was wonderful. So many panda's roaming,eating, laying, playing! It's not like zoo's whrre they have two pandas and they are aleeping the whole time. No this has many many",
          "I was there during Golden Week meaning it was incredibly busy, but the staff managed the crowds well and limited the numbers that could enter the enclosures at any one time. If possible though don't go during Chinese holidays! Was very interesting to see how the pandas live in",
          "I have always loved pandas since I was a child. To be able to watch these animals at such close proximity was a real treat. There is also a viewing window for the babies which was great and rightly the staff usher people through this area to keep things flowing. The setting here",
          "You have the choice of a long walk/hike up the road/trails or you can take the much easier golf carts for a fee. I recommend the golf carts if you have limited time or not very active. The walks can be long or the weather can be a little rainy. The pandas are hard to predict,",
          "The grounds are beautiful, well-maintained. The pandas are so cute. It gets very crowded so go early if you can. The directions on some of the signs can be misleading so expect to get lost! Take the shuttle to the top of the park and meander down. We took a taxi from Chengdu to",
          "Absolutely amazing. It can get crowded and the nursery is packed uncomfortably with too many people. If you have the option, go as early as possible. The pandas are more active when it is cool in the early morning and there are less out people to compete with.",
          "As part of our trip to China we visited the Panda research Facility in Chengdu and what a wonderful experience it is to get up close with the Pandas. one thing, there were very large crowds on the day we were day, as they were showing off the recently new born pandas - but it",
          "Also a must if you visit Chengdu. The pandas are amazing. The place is very well laid out. Clean and tidy. Didn't need a tour guide at all.",

          "I went there on a Sunday at noon thinking it would be extremely crowded but I was happily surprised with EVERYTHING. I made my own way by metro to Panda Ave station (less than $1) followed by a quick yellow shuttle bus (Hi-Panda) at an astronomical cost of 2 yuan. You buy your",
          "There were too many visitors at the time I was there, which kind of dampens the experience. But the pandas were so cute!",
          "there were far to many people visiting this place we were told they only have 20,000 people in one day they all must go in the morning, as this is the time our tour went there as most other tour groups I would imagine, trying to get there first. It was hectic from the start and",
          "The facility covers many acres and is home to about 80 Giant Pandas as well as the smaller red pandas. There can be extensive walking, but there is also a shuttle bus route. We were there on a misty day - apparently ideal panda weather - and saw many of the bears reasonably",
          "I was super excited to do this and it was worth it! It was really easy to get to - take the metro to Panda Avenue and there is a bus right outside that takes you to the park. The bus is free and you can buy entry tickets from the guides on the bus (This is legit). Don't bother",
          "a remarkable place, enabling viewing of the pandas in a caring, healthful and beautiful environment. wandering through the extensive leafy park, there are a variety of enclosures and great information. great to know that the ultimate objective is not only to save the population",
          "We visited the Giant Panda Breeding Base and it was one of the highlights of my visit to China. To see the Panda's in such close proximity and in such a near to natural environment with lots of space and climbing frames was totally amazing. The Panda's do appear to be content",
          "As of this review, I visited the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base twice; once on a weekday, another on a Sunday. There is a noticeable difference in crowd size during the weekend and would definitely return on a weekday. It's also worthwhile to visit as early as possible, at",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to China was to be able to see giant pandas of all ages as well as red pandas. We visited the week after the October holiday and it was fine for crowds. We saw 2 week old pandas with their carer, adult pandas eating (and being gradually covered",

          "Giant Pandas are reduced to around 2200 in the wild, all in Sichuan Province. Our guide outlined that pandas sleep for 15 hours a day, have the anatomy of a carnivore though their diet has evolved to be bamboo which they are only 20% efficient at digesting. So he said we should",
          "Thankfully our SNA guide was aware of all the pathways and we were able to see lots of pandas even though we didn't arrive until about 9am. The place is packed with people as you would expect and there are the inevitable really busy places where baby pandas are on display along",
          "Great experience and lots of walking - great panda experience - loved them now. Hopefully, less pushing and cutting on line in the newborn baby panda section.",
          "This place is great, the lay out, the enclosures and the park itself but the amount of people take away from the experience. We got there when it opened and left by 1pm as the crowds were too intense. You literally were aggressively pushed and elbowed to get to the front to see",
          "Surprised at how close to the city centre this research station is.It is one of the must see features in China. The pandas appear to be very well looked after and healthy. They are in fairly large enclosures and do not appear to be upset at all at their situation. They take vey",
          "A great place to visit if you want to see lots of Pandas. We only saw two babies and they were asleep, but the 'teenagers' were fun. We went early in the morning so that we had more chance of seeing active Pandas. Most were either eating or sleeping, but we did get to see the",
          "Went early to beat the crowds and i was well worth it. By mid morning the visitors were flooding in. Loved seeing the pandas and learning about them, Well worth the special trip to Chengdu on its own merit. Had a fabulous day (and the sun shone all day to make it even more",

          "Done easily in 2 to 3 hours. Just reach here before 9am (or earlier) if you want to see the pandas doing more than sleeping! Feeding time from 8 to 9 generally. Very young/baby pandas are out at 10am at both nurseries. Red pandas still active and eating at 11am. New born baby",
          "We visited the research centre at 9 am and were part of a volunteer program to assist panda keepers clean out roam areas and pens for the pandas. This takes about 1.5 hours and then you are treated to a walk around to see the other pandas varying in age from 1 year to 19 years.",
          "Once in a lifetime trip to see the Giant Pandas, they didn't disappoint. On the advice of our local guide we got there early in the morning,so they were outside feeding. What a lovely place very well maintained and to see the baby Pandas in the nursery was truly emotional.",
          "Go early ! See the feeding .. else just see the big fellas sleeping ... Toilet cleanliness. Excellent",
          "We were lucky as the weather was overcast and it had been raining, just the sort of weather pandas love. They were all outside rather than being inside and getting the feel it was more like a zoo. In addition to the pandas nibbling away on their bamboo sticks, you can also see",
          "I just love pandas. This research centre is the best place in the whole world to see pandas of every age in their daily life. I travelled to the centre by taxi. It cost 80 yuan or about $15.00 Canadian one way. My hotel was very close to Tianfu Square in downtown Chengdu.",
          "Easy access by public transport and taxis. Lots of taxis outside the park to catch a return trip back to the city. Start early as Panda's are awake and active then. They really are so adorable and cute. Also, going early would avoid crowds and allows you to enjoy the Pandas and",

          "If you are in Chengdu, this is a place you must go. The Gov't has put a lot of funding and effort in the preservation of this endangered species. It is evident here how much research, care, and education is being done for the Giant Panda. Go early in the day for lighter crowds,",

          "Best time to visit Pandas is between 7 and 9 AM as this is when they are the most active. Though I reached Panda base around 8:30 AM but was able to visit Nos 2 enclosure in Park around 10 AM and by then some Pandas had already slept. Though I was able to see some non sleeping",

          "Amazing weather in September and the place was so serene and green and extremely clean. Seen a lot of pandas, even the 2 months old in their nursery. Great walking paths, well maintained public areas and amazing conservation efforts doen by the teams! Absolutely loved it",

          "Huge are for visit the Pandas in Chengdu. We used little cars to go around as we had a short time to visit but we saw many pandas and the baby ones are the best. You can see then in a close range and it's one of the things that you need to see if you visit Chengdu.",
          "A wonderful but very wet visit to this amazing place. Our tour guide managed to switch the tour to the morning which is a better time as you can watch the pandas eating and playing rather than sleeping, which they tend to do in the afternoon. The pandas were on good form!",
          "A fabulous treat, despite the terrible weather - there was a downpour the day we visited, so bad that we had to buy emergency galoshes from a street vendor! The pandas were lovely, so entertaining, and it was marvellous to be able to see them at such close range. We even had a",
          "Pandas are cute. Go as many as you can. People told to go early in the morning because they get fed 8am then sleep, but it\u2019s not exact science. Their food is delivered at 8 but pandas do not always eat them all then sleep. I went twice and the second day was hotter, so many of",

          "One of the best stops on our tour by far. The exhibits are very open and the Pandas dont feel caged at all. The nursery with the baby Pandas was very cute. We went back a few times because we couldnt get enough. The entire complex has a great open feel to it and you can tell",
          "We were fascinated by the thousands of visitors and the order the staff controlled the crowds.The pandas were beatifull and we were lucky to see a baby panda as well. A must visit place.",
          "Lots of opportunities to see these amazing creatures! Some of them are sleeping of course, because they do a lot of that, but we were able to see some eating (their favorite thing), and some were playing. We visited in September and the line to see the baby pandas was very",
          "We arrived at 7:15, fifteen minutes before the base opened. The taxi ride from downtown Chengdu was only a 30 minute journey and cost less than 100 rmb, so we would recommend doing the same rather than faff with buses/tours. Arriving early was essential, as we had heard all the",
          "The place is a little misleading, it looks like a zoo, and acts like a zoo (behind and exhibit, you learn very little about the animal and the research they do.)",
          "Highly recommended to spend up 2-3 hours enjoying the walk around and admiring the giant pandas. Be there by 730am on weekdays to avoid the crowd that starts to come through by 10am.",
          "YES there will be crowds, but, WOW is it worth the visit. The Pandas are about as close to being in the wild as you can get. We have seen Pandas when they have visited at Zoos in Australia but this is vastly different. We are talking 30-40 Giant Pandas.Babies in the nursery,",
          "The place was very clean and well kept. It\u2019s not expensive to see the whole park. About 50rmb. If you get there around 8:00am the place is only a little busy. I recommend getting there early to avoid the crowds.",
          "An amazing place to spend a day. The area is well designed and kept and it\u2019s very nice to see the pandas enjoying their life. You can go there as a family, as couples. With friends or on your own",
          "I was not really sure I wanted to go here, but it was one of the best trips on our vacation. We were lucky that it was not too hot and there were not as many people as I had read there could be. The animals were plentiful and playful. The Pandas got food at different times so",
          "I have not been here for 17 years. In the interval many of the problems with Panda breeding and nutrition have been resolved. My hat is off to the diligence of the local scientists. The Panda population has grown substantially. Of course the critters are cute and pictures for",
          "I went mid September, on a public holiday. However there was torrential rain so it wasn't very busy at all. But the rain meant, as a group of 10 of us, we only got to go to the two nurseries. We did see a large group of 3 year olds, mother and pair of cubs, and several babies",
          "great place to visit, however is very crowded (albeit school holidays when we visited), thoroughly enjoyed",
          "The two of us visited the Research Base at 8am, which was a great time to come, as both the red pandas and black and white pandas had just been given their breakfast and visitors could see them all very easily. The crowds which came later seemed to be handled very efficiently by",
          "The location is quite far from downtown but easily reachable. Good to see funny panda. Try to see the baby panda. They are very funny during breeding time. Visit there during winter season however area full with tourists.",
          "The site is very interesting if you've compassion for animals. They give very comprehensive details of pandas\u2019 care and breeding, history. Must go in morning to view more of them in outdoor. Also check and don't go during china school or public holidays to prevent crowd & queue.",
          "This was the highlight of my China trip. Dont miss chengdu if you are visiting china. I could have stayed the full day just watching these pandas playing. They were amazing and very very cute. You will not see anything like this in the world.",
          "Highly recommend, if you are to Chengdu it must go to one of the pandas facilities, and this one although little bit crowded it is still a big facility with easy access through metro and shoutels, and again highly recommend experience. Tips try to visit in middle week when it",
          "We went as part of a tour, got to see some pandas, was very crowded, shuttle carts mixed with crowds not ideal, very little English explanations, so did not learn a lot. I believe there was educational areas which we did not see.",
          "We visited the Breeding Research Base as part of a tour. Actually, this was the only reason we chose to go to Chengdu, and we weren't disappointed. We didn't get there first thing, which is the best time because the pandas are most active early when they are eating. But we",
          "The park is beautiful and well kept. Thousands of visitors everyday and no litter. But the pandas are the show. Big ones, little ones and even red ones. A great place for young and older to see pandas. Very nice wide walking trails to go through the park. It was very hot when I",
          "We travelled here on a trip organised by Buffalo Tours and it was a great experience. We arrived very early and were inside the grounds by 8am, it was already very busy but not so much that you couldn't see the Pandas. There are approx 165 Pandas there and we saw some in every",
          "The Panda Research Centre in Chengdu is simply fantastic. Get there early, it opens at 7.30am. The Pandas are fed first thing in the morning so that's when they are most active. By 11.30am the crowds were really large so we were ready to leave. Saw over 60 Pandas and a",
          "No doubt that everyone will visit here, just try to arrive in the morning, so you can avoid line up and also can see active Kong-Fun panda, instead of sleeping \ud83d\udc3c",
          "Very few Pandas hidden from the crowd. is not more than a zoo, but only with Pandas. Crowded, to the point that was impossible to take a picture.",
          "They are the cutest and most adorable animals I\u2019ve ever seen. The staff seemed very happy looking after them, as if they treated them as their own family.",
          "You pretty much HAVE to go if you're in Chengdu, like hitting the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I saw a panda in San Diego years before... for me, it was enough. But it's the panda-region pilgrimage. Nice grounds, well marked, very clean, lots of people--not a lot of eating options",
          "Interesting to see how research was done to preserve the panda population. From conception till adult, all is explained. To go in the mornings to see how they wake up and eat. Very nice experience!,",
          "Hiw cute and funny are those animals! Visiting the pandas is something you must do if you come to China. Go there in the early morning, as it becomes too crowded afterwards and, furthermore, the pandas are brought inside as it gets too hot. Unfortunately, you will meet hundreds",
          "You will have the opportunity to see a lot of pandas, from small little babies, toddlers, teenagers to grown up old men trying to push each other out of trees. The much smaller, not-related red panda is also there. Wear comfortable shoes as this is a hilly area with lots of",
          "If you are a fan of pandas then you definitely want to pay this place a visit. It was definitely crowded, but there were a lot of exhibits which gives you an opportunity to walk around and see many different pandas. The red panda exhibit is an added bonus as they are very fun",
          "Had been panda keeper volunteers a couple of days before at Dujiangyan Base which I really enjoyed, but for me you cannot see enough pandas. We travelled to the base by metro and bus, arriving early. Entry was free by showing my passport, I think for over 60's. Was much",
          "We went during Summer holiday and it was packed. Wasnt the best experience due to the numbers of people. Great possibly during off peak or during winter when bears are more active. They chill out in the heat",
          "We had a great time walking about the Panda base - it was really a once in a lifetime experience - suggested to go early morning to avoid the mass amount of groups coming later",
          "We caught a taxi from our hotel to get to the base as it opened. This is suggested as the pandas are more lively in the morning while it\u2019s cooler, and the crowds grow throughout the day. We expected to be almost the only people in the park but we were wrong! Not completely",
          "I think possibly if you\u2019ve seen pandas before, you could skip this. If it\u2019s your first time seeing pandas, it\u2019s pretty cool. That\u2019s basically all you do is look at pandas. They\u2019re not very lively animals, so not especially entertaining. Glad I went but not a must see.",
          "This place is absolutely crazy busy and noisy with people ignoring the flash photography signs left right and centre but the pandas are incredible to see so close up and looking very happy too. I had a great time here, my advice is to get in the queue to see the baby pandas",
          "We enjoyed this but really it was too busy and too hot to properly enjoy the experience. We saw the baby pandas but it was only for a couple of minutes. Preferred Wolong Panda centre as we had more quality time with the pandas.",
          "We really enjoyed this as there were several Panda enclosures. It is very crowded during the Summer holidays but we went early so we could leave by midday.",
          "This was a crazy experience, it seemed like half of Chengdu was visiting the research center, absolutely packed with people elbowing their way along the paths- we saw three giant pandas in a glassed in enclosure and two red pandas in an outdoor exhibit. There was plenty of",
          "I am happy to see the pandas in such a peaceful place, dedicated to ensure the survival of the very beautiful and peaceful pandas. They and many others suffer from our polluting and cultivating more and more of their places of habitation.",
          "Very nice place, a opportunity for see the pandas and a good start for a wonderful trip. Lovely moment. It was very nice to see them in their natural habitat",
          "Certainly one of the hottest spots to visit. We left downtown at 7 am and arrived 7:40. Already very crowded. Long waiting time at the main spots and very loud guards pushing people with megaphones - even it is everywhere stated pls be silent... Happy to see the Panda\u2019s",
          "The title says it all - go early in the morning for the most panda activity - crowds can be a bit daunting",
          "Giant pandas, baby giant panda, giant panda teenagers(?) and even red pandas. You can get a good view of the animals and enjoy lovely grounds with paved walkways and a guided tour tram. Plenty of panda gear for sale. Panda mania!",
          "I would have given this review 5/5 if it wasn't for the amount of people visiting. The park itself is beautiful and seeing the pandas was simply amazing. Crowd control is non existent and can get very claustrophobic.",
          "We learnt our lesson from visiting other tourist spots and reach the panda research base at 7am. Online reports that the centre opens at 7:30am. When we reach, there was already a queue to buy tickets and to enter the gates! We have to jog up slope in order to ensure that we",
          "The complex is very well organised and the Panda enclosures are well set up. There are many Pandas to see, from young adolescents through to mature animals, and also new borns in the nursery. Like most attractions in China, the complex is very busy but we were still able to",
          "First and most important, BE THERE EARLY! Instead of having breakfast at the hotel, have a Jian Bing from one of the vendors outside the park. They accept cash, and ATMs are outside. When inside, go straight to the pandas , since they are more active the earlier in the",
          "This was one of our must do items in China and it was such a fantastic experience to see the Pandas. We were fortunate to see new born cubs and the the rempreture was just perfect for the Pandas to be at their most active. We also saw the cute lesser Panda. Unfortunately it was",
          "We went in August during summer break on a Saturday. It was wall to wall people. The pandas were active and you could certainly see them in spite of the crowds, but the number of people was mind boggling. I was also at this attraction in October 2017 during the week. There",
          "Got there around 8:30am and there was no queuing system what so ever. Was unsure where to get tickets from. Everyone was pushing in front of us. When getting closer to the front we were told we were in the wrong 'que' and had to go and que elsewhere. When eventually making it to",
          "I would recommend visiting A) in term time, not school break B) winter so the pandas are outside It's cool. The museum is good too. It's a big park and I would visit again when less busy.",
          "Don't come on a holiday weekend!! It was insanely crowded when I came during the Chinese Tomb Sweeping Day. I felt lucky to see the pandas at all with all the pushing and shoving going on. Opening hours of the Base are 7:30am to 6pm April through October and 8am to 5:30pm",
          "What a unique place, the only place in the world that you can see Pandas in their natural habitats, see baby pandas be nursed, and Panda cubs as they grow. This place is very, very busy, so get there as early as possible (it opens at 7am) and be prepared to spend a lot of time",
          "Pandas have always been one of my favorite animals, and getting to see such a diverse range of them in one area was a dream come true. Even when all they do is eat bamboo, you will have trouble taking your eyes off them!! When I first heard of the Research Base I had some",
          "I was really impressed about this special zoo. Important is to go and visit it in the morning from 7.30 am to 11.00 am. Too many people having the same idea to visit the park. Anyhow it is great.",
          "We took the subway to the Panda Avenue Station, where we took the special bus to go to the Panda Base (price: 2 RMB one way). You can also buy admission tickets for the panda base at the bus station but a friend had already bought our tickets online. At the bus station we",
          "I have no idea what I was expecting, but it wasnt just a zoo with only pandas. It makes sense looking back, but why dont people just say it's a panda zoo? It's cool, the pandas are cute. But it's just a zoo.",
          "It's easy from \"downtown\"/ Tianfu square by public bus - first a bus to the Zoo stop - there you make a transfer to bus nr 87 or bus nr 198 directly to the Panda Breeding Base :) the trip takes about 80-90 minutes! Ask in your hotel reception/ the concierge for Panda-tickets",
          "We spent a morning here. Arrived at 8.05 am and it was already very busy with large queues of lots of people with pre paid tickets! Despite the crowds we still saw lots of pandas and watched them for a long time. - all very cute! It was a bit of a scrum to see the younger pandas",
          "It was awesome to bring my little child with us to visit this magnificent park of panda it was really fun",
          "Get there early morning to see the pandas, nice place to spend a couple hours, can get easily crowded.",
          "Although I hate to admit it, this was the highlight of my visit to Chengdu with my tour group. However, I never anticipated the massive crowds of people who come to see the pandas. While the park is huge, we only did a small section of it and went to see the newborns which you",
          "My bad but I was thinking we were going to interact with the pandas. That site is apparently about 2 hours away from Chengdu, in the mountains where the pandas live. At this site, you get to see the pandas interact (go in the morning when they aren't so sleepy) and it's cute",
          "If you love animals do not support animal abuse in tourism. If you want to see reserve it is not this place! If you want to have just perfect photo of panda... Small cages are perfect for it. This place welcomes thousands of tourists every day. Pandas are closed in small",
          "Went on a Sunday to see the pandas - get there early!! It gets busier the later it is. Make sure to make it through the whole area, there are sections with more pandas in the back. They will be outside if it is cool enough, another reason to go in the morning!",
          "My family visited there on June 21. It\u2019s great place in Chengdu. Everything were pleasant and lovely. All Pandas and red Pandas were cute. According to our travel guide\u2019s arrangement, our early morning visiting time was very convenient due to summer time temperature and many",
          "For all Chengdu has to offer, the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is certainly among the most worthwhile destinations. Simply incredible.",
          "People waiting for hours to get a 2 second glimpse of a 3-inch newborn. Crowds 10 deep and it it is 98 degrees at 8:30am. This is a must-see but you must be prepared for lots and lots of gawkers. I still cannot figure out why we humans find everything about pandas cute and",
          "You can see 2 different kinds of Pandas, the \u201anormal\u2018 black-white and the less known red Pandas. The Great Pandas (black-white) have newly borns, some days/weeks old, young and adult animals (status: Middle July 2019). Nice is, that you can also see the new born little Pandas,",
          "We spent the whole morning watching the giant pandas, and also saw the one-month old baby pandas in the incubators. Although it was very crowded, we were able to view the pandas up close - a great experience! There are also many red pandas to see as well in a different",
          "An overcast day but best touring weather to see all different ages of panda bears with Lisa Liu from Wendy Wu Tours. Crowds everywhere as expected but they move freely so you can get great photos of the pandas. We saw a panda baby - one week old with no fur to younger twin",
          "Fabulous, fantastic. Guide and driver perfect. A dream come true to come and see the pandas. Will be back !!!",
          "If you can at all help it, don\u2019t go on a weekend or holiday. Get there as early as you can. We arrived around 8:40 and it was already super busy. We were still able to get up front with some patience, but the Saturday crowds were already pretty intense. By the time we left",
          "We had a private tour of grounds very busy so guide was very helpful. These animals are so lovely to watch. Grounds are clean and animals well kept lots of walking.",
          "At the behest of many travel blogs we arrived at the park at 830am to find long lines to buy tickets and enter. Luckily things move pretty quickly and we were glad we got there when we did since we were able to see 3 panda's wrestling with each other for about 30 minutes. Once",
          "great experience and i am seeing panda for the first time,making the day more special.good and clean place. Our travel guide ms.LUCY was very helpful and friendly",
          "Seeing more than just two pandas was what really attracted us to visiting the base. On a July morning, we did see what we wanted to see but man, was the park crowded. So many people, so few space... this therefor is a been there done that for us.",
          "Very clean and well organized. Everything is clearly marked with signs so this beautiful park is easily navigated.",
          "This is my 3rd time to this place. First time here in the summer so really felt the heat and humidity this time. For the giant panda paddocks, they have a few scattered around. To be honest, if you\u2019ve seen one I don\u2019t really see a point in seeing the others especially when it\u2019s",
          "This visit gave me a very good idea about the pandas. The film from the BBC in the tourist center was perfect",
          "I have been there but the indication for nit Chinese people was not very clear. Tickets very cheap Better to go when is not too hot or the Pandas prefer to stay indoor.",
          "Nice place to actually see and learn about Pandas. The worst part are the LOUD Chinese who tend to diminish my enjoyment when there are large numbers... they talk so loudly, talk even louder on their phones instead of enjoying the park and smoke when there are no smoking signs",
          "Probably main reason for most tourists coming to Chengdu. Pandas galore and as cute as can be. Nicely laid out facility with lots of different enclosures and loads of cute Pandas Skip the line for the shuttle bus - it\u2019s not far to walk and much quicker than lining up for the",
          "Our tour group arrived reasonably early at the panda base & the crowds were not too bad. The weather was perfect for panda viewing - overcast & cooler than it had been. All the pandas were out & about eating breakfast. The younger ones were playing with mum. They were comical to",
          "Awesome place to be with family with kids.we thoroughly enjoyed our journey with seeing different sizes of Pandas. We were quite late due to flight delay. Result was most of the pandas were tired and sleeping. Then also we had few awesome moments.",
          "We got to the centre around 8am- opens at 730am. Was not too busy and no line up at ticket booth. Price is around 54RMB for adult. It is a very large centre and you can either walk or get a shuttle. The shuttle line up was huge (ginormous by lunch time) so highly recommend",
          "Our guide took us early in the morning so we can see the Pandas enjoying their breakfast of bamboo shoots. After the breakfast at around 10am they go to sleep!!! What a life?",
          "Great to see so many panda (small and big) at a single area.. All different action from every single one of them..",
          "Everybody visiting chengdu must go see the pandas! It\u2019s an amazing experience and it\u2019s great to see these beauties! Defiantly better to go first thing otherwise any later you risk them all being asleep, as they sleep after food.",
          "Everyone who visits Chengdu should visit the pandas, best early in the morning when the pandas are more active. We visited on a rainy day but this did not spoil the experience with plenty to see at a bargain entry fee, had the weather been better we would have also enjoyed the",
          "the chengdu panda base is located outside the city but was very easy to get to by public transport. The metro is easy to navigate and buy tickets for and goes as far as \"panda avenue \" station and from there there are buses to take you to the entrance. We spent around 3 hours",
          "It was very enjoyable to see both red and giant pandas and learn about the conservation effort. I highly recommend seeing both the BBC film showed at many locations around the park and the Chinese film at the \"cinema\". They put everything in context and the visit gets more",
          "Yes, I was equally thrilled and charmed by the giant pandas and you are able to read thousands of reviews by others that concentrate on cute & cuddly. I knew that I should go in the morning to see the maximum number of animals and to avoid the crowds. So my review concentrates",
          "This Panda Reserve has a ton of pandas and all with different personalities! It was hard not to think of them as animals only because their antics appeared to be intended to entertain onlookers. Pandas by nature, I was told, are lazy, humorous, and seem to operate well in small",
          "As part of our group Tour of China we had a visit to this attraction. Unfortunately our visit was on a Saturday which meant that the site was extremely busy. Nevertheless we enjoyed our visit. It has to be done!",
          "Every tourist should visit it! its a huge park, with so many different pandas! i was there already 3 times!",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is very nice! It is clean and the exhibits for the animals are spacious and well-designed. We didn't get to see babies but the pandas are all ADORABLE and hilarious! I could have watched them in awe for hours! Go in the morning before it",
          "I listened to every review saying that you should go early in the morning, because that time pandas are the most active. I was there about 8:30. It wasn't that crowded as for China(it was Wednesday after all). There were a lot of places with pandas playing with each other, as",
          "The pandas are always fun to watch - but beware of crowds. Don't go on the weekend and go early. In one area one of the staff was trying to help a young panda out of a tree and it felt like Times Square on New Years Eve. Lunch here is adequate. Don't miss the \"red pandas\"",
          "This was one of the highlights of my entire trip to China! If possible go early and on a cool day for the most activity. The centre is bigger than I expected and we spent all day. I wish the food vendors didn't close so early, but otherwise it was great. The dedicated bus from",
          "I advise you go early in the day to see the pandas. They are fed early and apparently sleep much of the rest of the day. We caught them as they were fed and they were wide awake and even playful. The red pandas were very cute, so be sure not to miss them!",
          "We went with a tour group to see the pandas. Our tickets were arranged prior to our visit. We arrived at 7:45 and virtually walked straight in. Pandas were very active at that time. We saw the young pandas frolicking around. We were told their activity stops about 10 or 11. So",
          "What's better than spending Christmas with your mom? Spending Christmas with your mom AND adorable panda bears! At the Panda Research Base, you have the opportunity to interact, touch and (as a volunteer only) to feed the pandas. The paths are spacious and open, so even when",
          "Early June we went to the giant pandas research Center. We went in early afternoon and unfortunately due to the hot summer weather and coming just after they had lunch (I believe) all the giant pandas were sleeping. By 3 pm some had woken up and start eating but otherwise quite",
          "Very big and very crowded natural park. Mostly visited by chinese tourists. Try to go there as early as possible.",
          "Was really looking forward to this . Cleaned out enclosure and washed down the inside enclosure. Break up bamboo , but saw nothing of any research being done . Had minimal interaction with the pandas thought we would see very young ones . Got a meal with the staff who didn\u2019t",
          "We planned to spend an hour here but ended up staying more than 4. You can take a little train between areas within the park but the lines were long so we opted to walk, and we were so glad we did, walking through bamboo groves and along pathways through gardens bursting with",
          "The Chengdu Panda Breeding station is spread out over a large area. Older tourists may prefer to take a ride by bus to the top of the hill where you can watch the Pandas in natural surroundings. However we were unable to see the baby pandas as the nurseries were inaccessible. We",
          "The park is as breathtaking as the Pandas. Go early to beat the crowds and see the Pandas being fed. Very well designed to keep Pandas and offers a great experience to the public.",
          "This is a place which is easy to access for panda sighting as it is located by Chengdu city, suitable for those who has less time,otherwise Wolong should be the first option. This base is also well known as a birding place in Chengdu city.",
          "I took the metro to Panda Avenue on Line 3. I arrived before 7am so you can take a taxi/grab and you might see other tourists that you can share the ride with, take a public bus (I believe bus 87, 198 or 198A but verify) or walk which I did about 4.3 kilometers. I arrived at the",
          "Loved visiting the pandas, there were more than we expected and they were easy to see. The sanctuary is well maintained and very clean. Recommend this place very much.",
          "We had a wonderful guide for this. His name is Haba Yefei. He has been to the Breeding Base many times. He told us we needed to arrive by 7:30, so we did. The pandas get up early to feed. They don't like the heat, so they go in to sleep after their breakfast. Also, it gets",
          "Tip: get their for opening time! And don\u2019t join the line for the bus around the park, the walk isn\u2019t that far and you\u2019ll get to the pandas faster than the crowds. This place is really great, definitely worth a visit!!",
          "Highly recommend. Great to do with kids. Excellent experience viewing pandas. Take a taxi and getting around inside is very easy.",
          "First of all, the enclosures are big and spacious and afford great views of the pandas for everyone. The grounds are beautiful and well kept with walkways through gorgeous bamboo forests and trees. Prepare to do a lot of walking and wade through crowds of people. Push your way",
          "It was wonderful to see the pandas. We visited as soon as they opened as I believe this is when the pandas are most active. We saw lots and got never to be repeated photos. Don't forget to keep checking the trees, its amazing how such large animals can climb so high without",
          "If you love pandas you have to check this place out. There are so many pandas here. It seems like almost all they do is eat and the signs around the place tell us that this is because their digestive systems sort of sucks and they need to eat so much to get a little bit of",
          "Visited the centre on Monday 0900 and was so crowded.. (good to go early as the later panda will stay indoors due to the heat) Decided to take the tram but long queue and ended up walking will be faster. Unfortunately baby pandas not in view as not the birth season. RED",
          "We came here in the morning just after 9 am with a group and it was getting busy. Large attractive park with nice lake and gardens, the pandas were easy to see as the weather was cooler and wet today. We saw the red panda too! There are about 200 pandas here and a total of 200",
          "Visited here early in the morning as the pandas are more active then, than than in the heat of the day. You are guaranteed to see pandas - the large ones which are kept in separate enclosures and younger ones 9up to 3 years) which share enclosures. How do we get baby pandas if",
          "Absolutely amazing centre, promoting the successful breeding of the Chinese Pandas, which is vital to the survival of this species. Hit and miss as to whether the pandas are active or asleep, but you are more or less guaranteed to see active pandas in on enclosure or another.",
          "I had a dream to be up and close to my beloved Panda Bears. To be a Panda Keeper for a day was a check on my bucket list. The facility was clean, the grounds well kept, and the Bears appeared to be happy. I recommend this facility if you want to be part of their care.",
          "Nice park-like facility. Lots of pandas out and about for breakfast. We enjoyed it! They even had red pandas!",
          "Cheapest place in city to see Pandas of different ages. Try to get there at open to minimize crowds and have best chance to see feedings. Leave exhibits and museums for later",
          "Seeing the pandas was one of my trip bucket list items. The park is huge and does get quite crowded, but the wide pathways are paved and comfortable for walking. Beware that there are golf cart shuttles that move people through the park. The drivers don't use horns but rather",
          "We flew into Chengdu Airport and went straight to the Panda Base so got there early. Just a tip, we hired an English speaking tour guide and a driver (its cheap and well worth it), who drove us there and guided us around the base. On entry, don't waste your time in the queue",
          "Wonderful visit. Make sure you have a guide who knows the way around the facility. They can take you where there are not any crowds or at least less people since it can be very crowded. Start lining up at least 30 minutes before opening time to avoid waiting in line for a",
          "Beautiful grounds, very clean, and the pandas. If you are into pandas this is the place to come and see them!",
          "This is the place to see the pandas! I have been here twice in the past four years and both times it was remarkable. Definitely get there early before it gets crowded. It is not too far from the city. The paths are lovely to walk along with the bamboo. Be prepared to walk a bit,",
          "Love pandas ! They are amazingly adorable and cuties. Start early in the morning to avoid the crowd and the pandas are all out and active and playful in the morning . Loved watching all the Kungfu pandas. Take the shuttle .",
          "We visited on our own for about half a day. You don't really need a costly tour. We asked our hotel to call a cab to take us there. It cost only about 60RMB on the meter and we were there in about half an hour. I was unsure if I wanted to go there because I am not a fan of",
          "For me, this is the top attraction in Chengdu (& my second visit to the Research Base). What can you say? It's Pandas! I'd suggest going early in the day as 1) the crowds haven't gotten crushing and 2) the pandas are active. The red pandas are not to be missed. Take a picnic",
          "I mean who doesn't love panda's right? We went here on a sunny day which was perfect. You stroll around all the different sights and just have an amazing day. I guess we were lucky too, as the panda's were super active and played around with eachother. I've heard that some days",
          "This is a pretty big breeding facility and a lot of the pandas are in outside enclosures. The park can get crowded plus the pandas are apparently most active in the morning. So it's best to go early in the day, they open at 7:30 and we got there around that time and there was",
          "What\u2019s not to love about Pandas?? We spent a wonderful three hours wandering around on a tour and, at the start, were not quite sure what to expect (and being non-lovers of zoos). Once through \u2018passport control\u2019 \ud83d\ude0a, we were very pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the",
          "It might be cheating to ask people how their experience of being with Pandas all day went. Our group of 6 had a fantastic visit to the Breeding Center, where we did a few hours of work cleaning the animal enclosures and preparing some of their food. Our reward was being able to",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit, and to see pandas up close. We saw about 15 different pandas at various ages. We're told that they have around 70 pandas at this complex. The entire place is set up in an attractive park-like setting.",
          "How can you not give 5 stars to these wonderful creatures? However tiny, however large, they are all cute! Incredibly lazy, lolling around in the branches of trees and just eating and eating! Super visit and plenty of room for everyone.",
          "It was a great place for my nuns. They had great service and were very kind. SIS, THIS WAS IT. <3 Sister Nunibun",
          "Me and my nuns loved it. It was fun and cool and expensive but it was worth it. Love: Nun power sister",
          "On a rainy day we saw a lot of very active Pandas, best place to be in china. Beside the big pandas also 3 small ones",
          "If you are unable to see giant pandas in the wild, visiting this breeding centre is the next best thing. The pandas are housed outside in very spacious areas and as they are quite lazy they spend most of the day lazing up on the trees. The guide advised us that giant pandas",
          "We unfortunately coincided with a bank holiday weekend but it was still nice to visit. The pandas are in a number of enclosures - some are solitary and mature, 'teenagers' are in enclosures of 2-3 and can be quite funny but the gems are the baby ones who just clamber all over",
          "We visited on the first day of the 4 day May Day holidays and it was very crowded. Nevertheless there were officials insisting people keep moving so it worked quite well. There were many pandas out and they were very cute, with three young ones having quite a game together.",
          "Park is close to Chengdu. Easy to visit by taxi (40RMB). Go early (08.00 AM) when panda`s are still active. In the park everything is in walking distance. Don`t join the endless cue for the transport vehicles in the park.",
          "Fortunately the forecasted rain never materialized during our 2-hour self-guided walking tour. We had a wonderful, memorable visit to this unique park. Taxi from our hotel for the 40-min ride to reach here around 8 cost 87 RMB. Admission at 55 RMB/US$8 is a super bargain",
          "The park itself is a nice facility, though the signage is a 6/10 and could be improved. BIG PROBLEM is they over sold the entrance tickets by ten-fold they day we visited. Panda Park comfortably holds maybe 5,000 at a time but they allowed in about 15,000. Park was dangerously",
          "What a great and rewarding experience this was. Lots of beautiful panda all very happy and well looked after. Definitely worth the visit",
          "The red pandas have a large enclosure where they can wander through the trees, cross the path to the other side, walk up hills and over logs, so lots of enrichment. The keepers put some kind of squash out for them, and they loved eating it which was fun for us to watch. And",
          "I was really pleasantly surprised by how nice this place is. The pandas are such beautiful creatures. The park is clean, easily accessible and the pandas seem to be treated really well.",
          "Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. You have to squeeze through the crowd in order to get a glimpse of the pandas. It is a pain especially this time of the year when the weather is so humid for both pandas and visitors.",
          "Seeing the pandas in a natural environment and learning about the efforts made every day to preserve this species is a highly rewarding experience recommended to all Chengdu visitors.",
          "Now, I DO love pandas, like so many others! But we only went because our friend's wife (who was looking after us) was insistent we should see pandas. It wasn't a huge crowd there, but as the day was warm, all the pandas were inside, and that's where everyone gathers. So, you",
          "Easy to get to with subway line 3, stop at Panda Avenue. Bought ticket at the exit of the subway including 15 min bus transfer for 54 RMB each. That included the return. Free lockers for luggage are available in the tourist centre after the entrance if needed. We went early",
          "Although it opens at 7:30am, get there around 7am to buy tickets and stand in line, as the crowds are unbearable. Once inside skip the tour trolley and speed walk to the panda enclosures. Be prepared to walk, as the base is huge. I recommend visiting the baby pandas first, as",
          "We did this on our own (not really worth paying for a guided tour). Easy to take a taxi there (or public transport) and pay the entrance fee. It's like a zoo for just pandas (this is not the place where you can hold the pandas). There are various enclosures where the pandas are",
          "Definitely go in the morning 9-11 this is when they are eating and playing, after that time they lye around and digest the bamboo. Also we were warned not to go in the summer as they don't like the heat and are fairly dormant. Very nice setting, about 27 Pandas of various ages",
          "Go between 8-10 when they are eating, otherwise they may be sleeping. Also, be prepared to WALK! The area is hugh and spread out!",
          "The purpose of our trip to Chengdu was to see Pandas and this did not disappoint! We arrived by taxi at 7:25, tried to purchase tickets from the machine but they do not accept UK cards or cash so had to queue up at the ticket desk. At 7:30 the desks opened and it was a free",
          "Chengdu is not the easiest place to get to or the best city in China, but I would go again and again and again if I could. The research base is immaculate and you will never walk away saying I wish I could have seen more pandas. We were advised to get there right at opening",
          "I visited the place many years ago. Since then the place has been hugely expanded. The old areas near the front are mostly empty. Most of the pandas are kept in the new areas at the rear. When one visits this place, one should look for the baby pandas as they are cute and",
          "We took the subway from Chunxi Road line 3 to Panda avenue. This took about 20 minutes. We left at 7am because; as most people have stated; you want to get there early. Subway was not crowded at that time of morning and only cost 4y each. When we got to Panda avenue the shuttle",
          "Not only do you see Giant Panda in all stages of development (depends a little on the season), there are beautiful gardens and lakes to wander through. The science of the panda museum should no be missed.",
          "Nice and clean center. We saw around 30 Panda\u2019s. If you like Panda\u2019s then I recommend coming here. We spend 9 days tracking around China and this was my least favorite city. Saying that if you want to see them, come here. Lovely park, nice enclosures and pretty flower garden. We",
          "Beautiful place. Very big grounds. Take the bus if you have trouble walking long distances. But the line for the bus takes forever. Pandas are cute as ever but stinky and they don't do anything. My fav was the red pandas. This place fills up fast. I would suggest going early",
          "The Panda's were wonderful. As everyone says, get there early when it opens. We didn't use the shuttle and had a plan of what we wanted to see before it got busy. The park itself it beautiful to walk around and enjoy. We bought our tickets on the Klook app and it made it so easy",
          "Since an early age have dreamt of seeing pandas in the wild. Well this is the nearest to it. So many adult and babies in large, green open spaces doing what they do- not a lot! They spend a lot of time sleeping and eating and moving slowly around. Some were climbing trees,",
          "It's an unique place to appreciate lovely pandas with natural surroundings.As we all konwn, panda is the national treasure of China, there you can not only learn local culture but also get more recognitive knowledge towards the protection of extinct animals. In a nutshell, its a",
          "You don\u2019t need a tour to visit this place. We arranged private transportation for 7 of us. Those who are over 60 do not need to pay entrance fee - just show your passports. Our hotel concierge advised us to go early as the pandas are active in the morning. April was",
          "Lovely concept and beautiful park but ruined by the sea of selfie sticks and crowds. Go on a day with \"bad\" weather as the pandas will be more active and there will be less tourists. Really nice park and surrounding areas, just the experience is ruined by the sheer number of",
          "Very green and the pandas seemed to have a lot of space. Sometimes other visitors would get in your way a little bit and some tour guide have loud microphones that sometimes scare the pandas. I\u2019d never seen so many pandas in one day. Try to get there in the morning so you can",
          "A must see when in China! The place to see giant pandas and they didn\u2019t disappoint. Make sure you get there super early - they open most days at 7:30 - as pandas are most active in the morning and crowds get unbearable after 10a or so. Avoid weekends and holidays if at all",
          "I only have 48 hrs in the city and managed a four hour afternoon visit to this wonderful place . About 45 minutes from my hotel , the place was full of tourist , well organized , the tickets and entrance very simple to handle. 6 of us choose to walk instead of taking the tram",
          "I love pandas and I got to see over thirty of them while at this park-like research base. I found the open enclosures so nice for the pandas and tourist and that the pandas seemed to really like their areas too.",
          "This is such a beautiful lush vast amazing park with heaps an heaps of pandas in a cool jungle setting I saw heaps of pandas playing,eating, wrestling , climbing and sleeping it was such an amazing experience and the base also has great facts and information on the pandas and is",
          "The research base is huge, like the pandas themselves. A very efficient mixture of research facilities and visiting facilities. And the pandas: sleepy monuments, they even look tired of so much sleeping.",
          "A very popular place with tourists and locals alike.Arrive early for 2 reasons,1...try to avoid the major crowds 2...pandas are most active mornings and late afternoon. You will get a lot of non moving,sleeping pandas if you are here at lunchtime.The surroundings are quite",
          "We came to see thePandas and we were not disappointed. They came out to play and it was awesome. This is a very very busy tourist destination but the crowds sort of moved along at a reasonable pace. It was a very enjoyable day.",
          "A trip to the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is a must for anyone traveling to Chengdu, especially nature lovers. The Giant Pandas are unique and the research facility offers ample opportunity to learn about this magnificent animal. Most zoological parks throughout China",
          "Very enjoyable but not different from a zoo for panda's. Seem like a happy place for them. If you want to see babies, check ahead of time if there are any new borns.",
          "Wonderful atmosphere with around 120 pandas at different ages. From huge giants to months old little pandas you can see all.",
          "Our daughter has always been a panda loving so coming to Chengdu was a no brainer. The base was large with lots of panda areas, they also had red pandas, and peacocks running around. A wonderful way to spend a few hours! It was only a 30RMB taxi ride to the base AND when you",
          "Early morning is the best time , when they get feeded, because they are active then, otherwise the sleep all day long. So best time is between 7 in the morning and 9 pm",
          "Seeing pandas is always fun and although you can't get that close to them it was still a treat to see them. The center itself is easy to get around although was very crowded when we visited at the weekend. Naturally pandas are more active at different times of the day and I",
          "The reason we went to Chengdu was to see the pandas. We were not disappointed. We do not agree with zoos as such but this is the facility on the planet that is pulling out all the stops to save these wonderful creatures. We were entranced by the antics of these bears in an",
          "We arrived early and saw many many Pandas before the crowds arrived. The red pandas were very special to see too. Don't bother to wait in line for the shuttle bus. Its a great walk around the park and you get to see many pandas that you wouldn't otherwise see. The pandas",
          "Very big parc with a lot Panda\u2019s. Worth spending half a day to see all parts as during the walk they will all be or sleeping or eating or playing. The most funny was the place at the far end of the park where small panda\u2019s were playing and fighting while mum was eating :)",
          "On a weekday in April, we arrived at opening time and had the park to ourselves for an hour to watch the pandas feed. After 10AM, it begins to get incredibly busy. The opening hours say 8AM, but the park actually opens at 7:30...it's definitely worth waking up early to avoid the",
          "No matter when you visit it will be busy. Our guide wanted us there early and when we got there -- just at the 8am opening time -- it was clear that this was the right move. Even at opening time there were queues already lined up. Probably shouldn't give away the secret,",
          "Our group of 9 paid to be \"keepers for the day\". We cleaned the enclosure and got to see the bears up close through the bars of the cages. We were left for several hours to explore the center. Without a guide giving us some background, we were uninformed about the efforts of the",
          "A large hillside, so a nice place to amble around. Very busy with both Chinese and foreign tourists but still got to watch giant pandas and red pandas eating and playing. Well worth a visit.",
          "The pandas are as adorable as you\u2019d imagine and were much livelier than we expected. We arrived before the park opened and joined a small queue for tickets. The park opened at 7.30 and we joined the queue for the shuttle bus. We left it after about ten minutes as the kiosk",
          "This park is overcrowded on weekends and the number of visitors should be regulated. Instructions and explanations are in Chinese language, some being translated. Signs and directions are confusing. The bear areas are not too well maintained. Because of this we couldn\u2019t find the",
          "We came to Chengdu to see pandas, and boy did we ever! We loved seeing them in their beautiful habitat. Zoos and other animal establishments often make me feel a little sad, but not here The animals were all very well cared for, with natural like enclosures, which were kept",
          "I loved my visit to the Panda Research Base. Loads of pandas to see in a natural environment and lots of information about the breeding programme. The highlight was seeing a baby panda that was a matter of days old in the incubator!",
          "Other reviews are accurate about arriving early to see the cubs playing around their breakfast time and to avoid big crowds. We visited without a guide and without pre-booking and found it all very easy. Our easy travel advice: Travel by metro line 3 to Panda Avenue (15 -",
          "While most pandas were eating, one of the younger ones seemed to get great joy from tickling himself/herself. It is wonderful to watch all these beautiful, peaceful animals.",
          "Even though there were lots of people this was a fun place and very exciting to see the pandas. Loved it. Lots of shade in the heat of the day.",
          "I arranged a stop over in Chengdu in route to Bangkok to visit this centre. We arrived by Taxi at 8am. There were queues outside the base and hoardes of people already crossing out the prime places to see the pandas. The attendants did not monitor the lenght of time people were",
          "Must do if you\u2019re in Chengdu! The site is easily accessible via public transport. You can get a taxi but I would save your money for more souvenirs. There are multiple buses and the metro to Chengdu Zoo, then change to bus 198 towards the Research Base, which stops outside.",
          "As expected, the base was crowded even on a weekday. Upon entering the base, we saw a long line of visitors waiting for battery-powered shuttle cars. There are only eight cars with each carrying 14 passengers. No wonder the line was so long. Our guide estimated that the waiting",
          "This is a research and breeding center for giant Pandas and red Pandas. It has a zoo like feel. There is a lot walking and hills. Our group paid extra to take the shuttle to the top of the hill and then work our way down. There were a lot of people and school groups when we got",
          "As everyone says, get there early. You don't need an English guide, don't waste your money. Big tourist sites like this in China have reasonable English signs and maps. Take the Metro to Panda avenue, buy a ticket for the yellow bus and ride it to the site. Expect a lot of",
          "Arrived early to the research center and beat the crowds. We were able to see the cubs and the adults as they feed in the morning and are more active. I would recommend getting there around 8:00 am because the park is mostly empty and you can see many of the enclosures before",
          "You can get very close to the pandas and watch them eat and roll around. You can spend hours here or get it over with quick. I would suggest going early and beating the packs of native tourists and all of the schools. Early early in the morning!",
          "Our guide Haba told us before hand that to see the Pandas in action we must reach early. We reached little late, by 9.30 and the babies had finished their breakfast! Nevertheless, we saw some of the grown ups in action - chewing bamboo, playing with others ....... Apart from the",
          "We arrived at about 9 as part of a small English tour party. Our guide was able to ask staff where the active pandas were so we were able to see quite a few pandas including one group of 6 eating. A few were sleeping in the trees. If you do not have a guide look for the crowds.",
          "The panda centre is open at 7.30, and I was there at 8.30. The crowds rolled in around 10.30 and then viewing the pandas was extremely difficult. Early on I had my choice of prime positions for photos of the gorgeous creatures, all dutifully munching on their bamboo cones. There",
          "The panda breeding and research centre give you ample opportunity to observe the pandas in natural enclosures. The pandas can be seen on platforms, in trees and on the ground. When we were there we saw a couple of pandas eating bamboo which was very cute. The facility also has",
          "Adult tickets cost us 52RMB each through CTrip. Children under 7 are free and half price for those under 18 years. Incredible value for money. English guides can be hired but are unnecessary due to all the signs being bilingual (great translation). It's busy but well",
          "We walked the entire park, and saw one panda through the window. Granted that was nice, but we expected more. The park itself is a bit of a trek to get to, and there is much walking to get through it. Perhaps the weather impacts panda viewing? This was in May.",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is one of top 3 places to visit in Chengdu. The Pandas are fantastic!!!",
          "All I can say is that you will really want to take one home. They are so much fun to watch and the place is quite well organized.",
          "Giant Park. Must see! Specially good for families and children. Must arrive early morning to see best of Pandas. Afternoon Pandas like to take naps. For best experience early arrival recommended!",
          "I stayed at Shangri-la Hotel great place and we had the concigere arrange a cab to Giant Panda Breeding Research Base it was truly a high light of my trip. Will take my family someday there because I believe it was truly worth it.",
          "Clearly the highlight in visiting this part of China. We stayed in the center of Chengdu at the St. Regis Hotel, and everyone told us to book a private tour for $80-$100 per person. Totally unnecessary. We took a taxi both ways, bought our tickets at the research center and the",
          "We visited city of Chengdu on a business trip and we had some time to visit Panda breeding center. We bought tickets by our hotel on Chunxi Road from Panda tour buses that included a drive to the center plus a ticket and a drive back to Chunxi Road. When we arrived at the",
          "As others have advised, go early in the morning before the beasts are plum tuckered out from consuming tonnes of bamboo. Indeed, watching them eat has to be the purpose of the trip! The centre is accessible by bus but if the budget affords, taxis are plentiful.",
          "Placed right at the top of chengdu ,parking an issue ,so get taxi much better.55 yuan to get in about \u00a35 each ,try and get there before 9 am as the pandas sometimes go bed at 10 am, great park LOVLEY bamboo walks , take a pic nic too. But the pandas are amazing , as must to go",
          "This place was really well done and exceeded my expectations for a zoo in China. We could have stayed the whole day here. We arrived at about 8am and the pandas were all busy eating their bamboo breakfast. A million picture opportunities. It is clean. Restrooms were also",
          "I went with Tour China , our guide was wonderful we got to see the pandas eating and the 14 babies at the facility. Our guide new the best times to bring us for both the Giant and Red pandas to get the best experience. If you love these creatures, I highly recommend going to",
          "We visited the PBRB in December at around 9:00 am. The timing was perfect as we had unimpeded views of all the pandas, across all ages, having breakfast. Most enjoyable and a heartwarming experience. I was shown photographs of the Base during the high season. How anyone could",
          "As background, my family visited the Chengdu Field Research Centre for Giant Pandas (near Dujiangyan) in 2017. While we had a nice experience there, I would say that this place was more impressive. Upon arrival, I wasn\u2019t expecting much \u2014 likely because it is so close to the",
          "I just love the research base. Educating people about the protection of pandas and how to preserve their existence. I\u2019m not a big fan of playing with animals and taking their pictures and don\u2019t necessarily agree with that but overall a good learning experience.",
          "we went on Thursday, not so crowded. the area is very big, lots of walking but can see many pandas so worth it.",
          "Long-story short, it's a special experience by any measure, just for the privilege of getting to see real live Pandas. Great on many levels: animal lovers will be happy to them, and in clean good quality quality environment, families with kids will find it most entertaining,",
          "A visit to the giant panda was the highlight of my time in China. These magnificent creatures were wonderful to watch. Who knew they could climb trees. Visitors can also view the red panda. Well worth the trip. Arrive early to avoid the crowds.",
          "It was a bit disappointed when we go all the way to the sanctuary to see the panda, at the end, we only manage to see a small number of panda in the air con room with a long wait for more than 45 mins, nothing in the wild on that day. Not worth the 1 hour ride to go there.",
          "Everything was brilliant for me. I have been here for a couple months as a trip. It was so lovely city.",
          "Highly recommend a visit if you are in Chengdu! Beautiful facility to view pandas up close! Closer than any zoo! (and I\u2019ve seen them in Washington DC and San Diego)",
          "Got the chance to go during a winter weekday, so the crowd was manageable. I did the whole tour in 2 hours, with using the little train to go back to the entrance (very cheap). All the pandas were outside, and easily spotted. Just go to where the crowd is, because this is where",
          "I have been three times to the Panda Base, so becoming somewhat of a regular! The Panda Base is a beautiful spot and the only place in the world where you can see so many pandas. Yes, it's a zoo with only two different animals (giant pandas and red pandas) but you don't feel",
          "This is an amazing place to visit, well planned, cleaned and up close with the Pandas - make sure you go with your own tour guide - we used Haba - see my comment about his services.",
          "Though we had been to Chongqing zoo pandas this place is amazing. 180 Panda of various ages where on display. The place is well spread out, easy walking with plenty of toilets. We went in December when tourist numbers are low. Our guide Chris had us go early so we could be there",
          "We went at the end of January and I was afraid because in China some iconic places can be crowded super fast and early in the morning. This time we were lucky !! We were there around 9 - 9:30 because was panda\u2019s breakfast time. Wasn\u2019t too much people so we have plenary of time",
          "Get there early-- the crowds are a REAL thing. The place is huge, so wear comfy shoes. They sell food & snacks in the park, so don't be afraid to spend a whole morning wandering & do lunch here. There are quite a few habitats, and the lake is a stunner. But like, don't try to",
          "A great place to see the giant panda & red panda\u2019s. Go early. The panda\u2019s are active early in the morning & when they being feed. Walk to the top of the park & work your way back to the lake/ museum / entrance area. Great to see adult pandas, sub adults, young /yearlings. Easy",
          "Good experience for a half day trip. Since the weather was good, we could actually see soany pandas of different ages ranging from babues to sub adults and adults. Apparently we saw them during their lunch time\ud83d\ude05 because we saw pandas having lunch in groups as if they were a",
          "Have been 3 times now, and it is getting g better each time. MUST go early if u want to see the Bears moving. They eat early and then sleep all day!",
          "Lots of pandas here, and quite affordable. We paid $8 USD a person to enter the park, and the taxi was around $8 each way from the center of the city which was about a 30 min ride. I definitely recommend heading there in the morning when the pandas are feeding and the most",
          "The most amazing place to see Pandas up close and personal! A great open park full of nature! It was amazing seeing the pandas so close! It\u2019s a huge park and there is a mini train to get around if you don\u2019t want to walk. I would recommend to anyone who is visiting the area! It\u2019s",
          "On a cold January weekday morning (we arrived about 08:30) we saw absolutely loads of pandas up close as it was feeding time - amazing experience and brilliant photo opportunities!! However by the time we left (around 11am), even though it was off season and a weekday the park",
          "Fantastic! Enchanting! Can't but help love the Pandas! And the local school children were fantastic!",
          "The Chengdu Panda Research Center home to nearly 50 giant pandas and red pandas. We saw the newborn pandas and the queue was long but it fast and well organized. We went early in the morning to see the panda feeding and they were very active. There are lots of places to take",
          "Was so unexpected an amazing research center. The number of pandas was incredible from babies to huge older ones. Wonderful to see how the people of China are saving this species and hopefully one day we will be able to see them back in there natural environment. So very",
          "The research center was well planned and with reasonable and pleasant walk, you can access all the facilities. It was off season so we could enjoy seeing panda from decent angles. There are different age groups of pandas and they are lovely to watch than we originally thought.",
          "This is one of the best attractions in Chengdu and strongly advising people to visit the place if you are there. Kids loved the visit and we were able to witness more than 20 pandas during the trip. Unfortunately did not come across any baby Panda's as most of them were at least",
          "A lot of Pandas, we especially enjoyed the young pandas (teenage I guess) they are very active and fun when they first get out and to their bamboo breakfast afterwards they just lie around so it pays to go early (first thing in the morning). Panda cubs where really cute, we got",
          "The Centre was well set out, great views of Pandas (lots of them), about 10 young Pandas in a nursery/creche. The tour guide was informative and made sure we could see it all. The trip was part of a Pandemonium add-on tour of our Webjet/Travel Asia Holiday.",
          "Probably one of the reasons you are in Chengdu is to visit this great facility. I was surprised how built up the suburbs are in the immediate vicinity, but once inside the park, it is wonderfully landscaped and you get to the the pandas in a variety of enclosures. It can get",
          "On a snowy morning it was very picturesque to watch the pandas at play and eating. As it was cold many were curled up asleep though and the nursery wasn\u2019t open. The grounds are beautifully kept, peaceful and lush and everything is we\u2019ll signposted. Cheap shuttle buses transfer",
          "Our visit exceeded our expectations. We followed the advice of other travelers to be there when it opens at 7:30am because the pandas are active in the morning only. Our hotel told us it opens only at 9 and fortunately we didn't believe them since the reviews and website says",
          "After seeing Hong Kong, Beijing and Xiamen. We had arranged through recommendation a tour guide for 2 days in Chengdu. Yoyo, a Chengdu local with over 10 years tour guide experience both from in China and all over Europe, met us at the airport and she exceeded any and all",
          "The big day had dawned.... the day we were so eagerly looking forward to and perhaps the main reason for our visit to China -- to see the giant pandas. Here we were in Chengdu on a cold, rainy morning, up and ready to visit the giant pandas with fingers freezing and we pulling",
          "Saw many giant pandas in naturalized surroundings. The exhibits were well organized. Took a motorized transport to the top of the hill and walked down back to the entrance, which was helpful.",
          "Amazing half day with the cute pandas! My husband and I spent a few hours here looking at the super cute pandas eating and playing. There is quite a lot of walking involved, but it was a cold and cloudy morning, so we didn't mind the extra work out to keep us warm :-) definitely",
          "Fantastic experience, so much information and a lovely environment . We had a great local guide who was very knowledgeable and we had a relaxed leisurely tour. Taking a leaf out of the Pandas book, everything is very slow, a truly amazing and worthwhile visit.",
          "I just visited the Panda Research Base for the second time. I loved seeing the baby pandas. I went on a cold winter weekday morning so it wasn\u2019t too crowded. I suggest taking the shuttle bus up to the top of the park and then walking down unless you have a ton of energy. There",
          "Learn a lot of information about panda through this visit. Though I must say winter might not be the best time to visit as you might not be able to see baby panda",
          "This was my first visit to the Breeding Research Base. We had a guide who introduced us to the history and pointed out the different pandas and their ages. It was a great learning experience to learn of the differences between the red pandas and the usual black and white ones.",
          "Its the best place to see Giant pandas and Red pandas both. Very closely you can see healthy and active pandas. Its a well managed place by Chinese Scientists and administration. Very clean and attractive compared to other countries. Can learn A-Z about pandas at this amazing",
          "Great place to bring family and kids to learn and understand more about this endangered species. Best is to sign up for guided tour as the tour guide would be able to explain in details about the Panda as not all information is stated on the signage.",
          "Made my way alone from city (Holiday Inn Century) with taxi. Cost me about Rmb75 (about S$15) one way. I went at 8am when pandas were at their most active time of day playing, being fed etc. Without a guide, I didn't get useful information. Didn't find the trip enjoyable.",
          "Was a zoo-like research facility with multiple pens for pandas of differing ages and a separate facility for young/juvenile pandas Great way to see them up close and admire their Cushy life. Also present were red pandas which were equally interesting",
          "If you have not a fan of panda or those who see it done it type, this is probably not a place you want to go. I have to say it's not my first choice because I have panda on several occasions. However, I have time to spare and so I went on a local tour that comes with Sanxing Dui",
          "If you are in China, you must make sure to visit Chengdu, and the breeding and research facility. Like a zoo, but all pandas, and very large. Tram service for those with mobility issues. A lifetime experience if you are an animal lover.",
          "Extremely crowded. Be patient to see the babies in the nursery. Walk along the pathways to see the Giant pandas in their habitat. Also saw red pandas. Was able to get many good pictures.",
          "We were part of a large group who visited the Centre in November. We caught the shuttle bus from the reception area. At first I thought it was going to be a case of sheer luck if we saw the pandas but once we had passed the first area, we saw lots of pandas at every point. They",
          "Enjoyed the education and the panda habitats. The service by the minibus/tram was excellent as there is a great deal of variation and walking/climbing. I saw it on Saturday pm and it was very busy. Lots of pandas as expected. If you are older/disabled probably not the best place",
          "Go during the weekday to beat the weekend crowd. This place is simple and kept up very well. Lots of pandas, easy to see/access.",
          "We visited Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding (Panda Park) by morning around 8.30 am in NOV 2018. We were lucky to spot nearly all the Pandas in the Park as it was winter season as Pandas were out in the Park.",
          "I read some reviews, ...so do your homework first, than go, to avoid dissapointment! 1. visits during summer makes no sense at all 2, go in the early morning and you can leave for lunch happy 3. take a bus for 55rmb included tickets from K~alley or the Metro to Panda avenue from",
          "My coworkers took me here during a business trip. I can say that it is a chance of a lifetime for most people to see so many pandas. Also, this is a rare opportunity to see baby pandas. The park layout is a not straightforward and it's easy to miss some of the enclosures. I",
          "An amazing experience to see these incredible creatures up close and personal We were lucky enough to have a close encounter with a baby panda even though it was only a ten second meeting This is a very exclusive experience that is hard to put into words but will be forever in",
          "Great place but make sure you go as early as possible. There's queues even before they open (730am), but it just gets worse as times goes on. Go early, walk quickly, be patient and don't forget to go and see the red pandas. So fantastic seeing pandas up close and playing around",
          "We had a whirlwind stopover in Chengdu with Wendy Wu Tours specifically to see the panda research station\u2019s resident Pandas. We were picked up from the airport by our guide and went straight to the Pandas. We arrived at about 2.30pm on a clear day and were treated to a lot of",

          "make sure you get there early before it gets too busy. the lake is very nice area to finish your day",
          "We arrived in Chengdu around lunch time and were able to join a 2pm tour to the panda research base. At this time we got to see a number of the adult pandas, but only one of the little babies. Most of the pandas were asleep or sleepy (still cute), though we got to see 2",
          "Does not matter if you are a tourist or here for business, you have to go there one time! there is no other place in the world where you can see so many pandas!!!",
          "A must when in Chengdu. A very special experience! We saw pandas at all stages of development from babies to fully mature! Gorgeous!",
          "Spent a full day at the centre and saw several giant pandas in habitats as natural as could be provided.You get the chance to be close to them and if you have patience to wait for a good spot because of queues,get great photos.There were also red pandas on show but not as",
          "We took a shuttle from the subway, which was included in the \u00a555 entrance ticket bought at the shuttle station. The shuttle station can be found just outside panda avenue subway station of line 3, the first shuttle leaves at 7:50. So we arrived at the Panda base at around 8:10",
          "The Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is a wonderful place to see pandas of all ages and learn about their habits and habitat. The base is an imitation of the panda's natural habitat so you are surrounded by bamboo trees over 92 acres. This does not feel like a zoo - it feels",
          "We were there this morning. At one of the enclosures saw five very active giant pandas eat, climb up and down trees, chase after each other, and wrestle among themselves. One even fell off a tree because the branch couldn't hold its weight, and broke off. It was hillarious! The",
          "What an amazing facility. The facility is incredible and they do such a good job of taking care of the pandas. I got so many wonderful photos. If you are a bird watcher, there are also a lot of great birds there too.",
          "We decided to visit mid-morning to escape the ever present Chinese crowds! So glad we did as it was pleasantly \u2018quiet\u2019 and we were able to see pandas at our own leisure without having to jostle for space. They may be less active at this time but it really didn\u2019t bother us and we",
          "Rainy weather but lesser crowd if u go early. joined a small grp tour by windhorse n ghere were only 5 of us all foreigners. Della our english speaking guide was friendly n informative. Panda was hvg breakfast. lots of walking required. the docu movie is good. pandas are sooo",
          "Enjoyed my trip a lot at the Panda park but should have came earlier. Try to go before the park opens by 10 min so you can enjoy a more peaceful time.",
          "Pandas galore- pandemonium of the best kind! The babies were especially cute. Red pandas also worth seeing. Loved this day!",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived early before it became too crowded and were immediately rewarded with a stunning view of a giant panda. We saw all sizes from babies through to teenagers and several adults. They either slept or ate, enjoying their relaxed",
          "Advantage is this place is near city centre so easily accessible. Also, seniors above 60 years old get free admission. Not many pandas though even when we visit early morning.",
          "This Panda Breeding Research base is extremely well done. The grounds are a very nice respite from the hardscape of Chengdu, the Pandas are easily accessible, we had a nice lunch at the Bamboo Restaurant and everybody was friendly.",
          "Apart from everything everybody can tell you about this wonderful huge mono zoo I was most impressed by the movie shown at the entrance ( and also a bit further in the park) We saw a giant panda feeling a bit restless and then - floop - the birth of a tiny pink sort of piglet.",
          "Totally enjoyed the visit here. The panda viewing was much better than expected due to the large open enclosures. Had to be patient for photos sometimes due to the large number of mainly Chinese tourists. Morning is the quietest time to come. The tiny baby pandas were rather",
          "Went on a group tour with Trip A Deal to this panda base. Was fantastic, were lucky enough to watch the adult pandas playing around. Lovely park and for those that struggle walking there is a courtesy golf buggy type train. Would highly recommend this tour.",
          "Beautiful seeing the pandas. There were 6 little pandas which we queued up to see inside and they were all in a big cot. So cute. The reserve is well kept and heaps of pandas. Extremely enjoyable.",
          "We spent a great 4 hours watching the pandas in this well appointed, well run center! It was a weekend so it was quite crowded, but still plenty of opportunities to see the pandas. Bring mosquito lotion if you tend to get bitten.",
          "We took a taxi from the hotel and it was easy to get a taxi back. Use the green taxis as they are the ones with meters. Allow at least 3 hours and try to go in the morning because the pandas sleep in the afternoon.",
          "Great place to visit to see many Pandas. As per the guidebooks get there early - it opened at 0730 in October as the Pandas are fed early. As there\u2019s little nutrition in bamboo they then fall asleep to conserve energy. So unless you want to see snoozing Pandas get there early.",
          "The panda sanctuary was a wonderful experience, even though it was busy so you were always with a large number of people anywhere you went. The pandas of all ages, sizes were on view in all areas and it was easy to get terrific photos. The red pandas were out and very close,",
          "Many pandas to see, from young to old. Come early to see panda activities like playing and eating. They tend to sleep in the afternoon.",
          "Had a lot of fun watching the panda eating, walking, and just plain sleeping. They did a lot of sleeping when we were there. Some though were in the trees. It would be long walk had it not been for the small buses transporting visitors from one area to another. It is autumn so",
          "Honestly one of the best experiences, such a beautiful sight We were lucky enough to have an English speaking guide who took us round , the place is massive so be prepared to spend a whole day there, Lots of stuff to buy which isn\u2019t over priced like most tourists places",
          "definitely go early. get there before the first feeding and first huge masses of tourists arrive. it's quite enjoyable all day but a bit more magic in the morning",
          "must go. 1. easy trip from center city. cab 50 rmb, 30-40 min trip. 2. go early in the am. pandas active from 7:30-9:30am. adults pretty much sleep after that. 3, nice places to walk around, relax, and picnic in addition to pandas. we were recommended 2.5 hours but we spent",
          "You will see some baby pandas wriggling on the bed for sure, and check every corners and rooms, you'll find some where a big naughty panda climbing on the door waiting for food, or playing actively... check the weather before you go, cause if it's sunny and warm, and you get",
          "You will see adorable giant pandas playing on the well maintained ground. Walking the paths itself is also very pleasant with lots of bamboo providing shades and look very cool. This place is not only for kids, there are many adults coming by themselves and enjoy the nice",
          "What can i say, going to this fantastic place was the high lite of the tour for us, watching these beautiful animals at the breeding centre,we were not disappointed, watching the young pands play rough and tumble was a joy to watch.",
          "We have all seen Pandas in pictures and documentaries. But to see them in person is amazing. They all seem to have their own personality, especially while chewing on their bamboo sticks. We were quite surprised to see Red Pandas, something we did not know. Overall, a great",
          "This is a great place for everyone to get a close hand view of the pandas. There are multiple viewing areas set out along a short walk. Perfect for families!",
          "This was one of the highlights we had been looking forward to and we were not disappointed. We were in a group, but well organised by our tour guide who knew her way around and how to avoid the crowds. Nevertheless it is crowded in places and patience is needed to get the best",
          "Don't miss this attraction even without children. Great experience. Nevertheless, you should come early as you can. We came at 8:30 and we were able to enjoy ourselves. People that came at 10:00 complained that it was very crowded.",
          "Seeing all these pandas puts a smile on everyone's face! Get there early (8am or earlier). The crowds were overwhelming by 10:30am.",
          "Very good layout and plenty of pandas and baby pandas. You can\u2019t handle the babies any more but always a few about to see. Lots of red pandas as well. Get there as early as you can, the crowds can be large.",
          "This is THE center for panda research and conservation in the world. It's a large park of bamboo forest where you can observe pandas (including the more elusive red panda). They also have the research and breeding center. We were lucky to see seven panda cubs that were only a",
          "This is really a must see when in Chengdu. As everyone else has said, it\u2019s brilliant to see pandas up close and in a semi - natural environment. We took a taxi (45rmb) from the city centre and arrived at 7.15am - already a queue forming. But the park is so large that you can",
          "Unfortunately we were there on a national holiday so it was VERY crowded. Even with the crowds it was worthwhile. We got to see pandas inter habitat. I have no idea how may are in there - but it is lots. I am not sure if my highlight was seeing an adult panda high in a tree, or",
          "Take metro line 3 to panda avenue, leave at exit A and go up the escalator. There is a dedicated booth straight ahead with park employees wearing yellow jumpers/jackets. Purchase your park entrance ticket for 52rmb pp (adult) and get a free bus transfer to the park. Shuttle",
          "Outstanding if you visit first thing in the morning when the pandas are at their most active. We arrived at 8.30 when the older pandas were still having a lovely play in the trees etc and the babies were outside for the public to see but by 10.30 the babies were out of sight and",
          "Took Metro Line 3 to Panda Avenue, then took the shuttle bus to the Research Base. You'll want to visit early, arriving not later than 9:00 am, since Pandas sleep most of the day. Both Red Pandas and Giant Pandas are housed here, and most of what you'll see is in outdoor",
          "One of the three provinces (Szechuan) where we can see Pandas in China and this is largest giant panda breeding site. You can easily see about 20 of these cuddle balls although we learnt there are over 170. The pandas are out and about doing their usual lazing around, sleeping,",
          "We had a private guide who guided through the complex. It is very crowded with Chinese tourists. It was fun to see the different pandas from the very young to the giant pandas.",
          "A must to do when in Chengdu.A well set out attraction where you self walk around the grounds to the various sections of the pandas.You have the red panda,giant pandas,teenage and baby pandas. It is a lot of walking but you can pay to take the shuttle bus around the grounds. You",
          "Go to the centre early morning to see the pandas at their most active. Take good walking shoes and toilet paper with you.",
          "They open at 730 I would make the effort to be there whatever your guide says. Great pandas but not as many as I expected. People travel a long way to see them and yet many enclosures were closed. Saw two of the 30 babies born recently. I loved it but by 11 am it is mobbed and",
          "You cans many sites in pictures but the Pandas you need to see in person. The base is very large and the grounds are wonderful. It will take a minimum of an hour to see everything or longer. Plan to spend a half a day.",
          "Whatever your expectations are before you visit this outstanding facility - double them. It is a privilege to view these amazing creatures close up without having to peer through cages as you would in a western zoo. It is the closest experience you can have to seeing them in the",
          "Tooooo cute , such a big place , easy to get lost! Use ur Student ID if u have one! Also , be careful with the taxi guys outside, make sure you have DiDi !!!",
          "What an incredible visit my boyfriend and I had to see the pandas. We went for opening time at 7.30 (highly recommened) so that you reach the enclosures for breakfast time when the pandas as most active. It was a life dream to see the pandas in a sanctuary (not a zoo) and the",
          "We made a detour in our trip especially to see pandas and weren\u2019t disappointed. The research base is educational and entertaining, with opportunities to see areas such as the veterinary hospital, panda kitchen where meals are prepared as well as to view Giant and Red pandas in",
          "The Chengdu Goat Panda reserve is for excellence a place that you have to seem if you visit Chengdu. Great place to have fun with your family members and kids. Also to help to preserve the wild life diversity of Pandas in the world because the money you pay for the entrance go",
          "I came here during a visit to Chengdu and really enjoyed the morning. You walk through a lovely park with forests and there are many stops where you see pandas of different ages - adults, juveniles and small babies. I arrived soon after the opening and at first it was not so",
          "Yes, it is true that Giant Panda Breeding Research Base is more a ZOO than a nature park. And yes, it gets crowdy even on working days. BUT pandas are pandas. I honestly have no idea what it is about these animals which makes the experience special, but it worked. Though it is",
          "We came to Chengdu to see the GIANT PANDAS and we were NOT disappointed! This is a wonderful park spread over 500 acres. You can see it all on foot... or you can wait in line to catch the free electric shuttle cart...",
          "Highlight of our trip so far. Although this is much closer to a zoo than seeing animals in the wild it is still a very pleasant park and really the only way to see pandas. We preferred the juveniles that were in a larger parkland area than the enclosures for the adults but it",
          "We arrived before 10.00 to make sure we saw the Pandas while they were still active, but in fact at this time of year it doesn\u2019t reach the temperature at which they want to go indoors so there is plenty of activity much later. Even at this time though, there were crowds and",
          "Of course this is very nice to see, with appr. 140 panda's, amongst whom some unbelievably cute baby panda's (they sleep on their belly...) The park is quite large, but still tends to get (very) crowded. Two tips. First of all: go early. We were there at 7.15 hours. The park",
          "Went there this morning (Saturday) and we arrived at 7:45. By about 9:30 the place was heaving. Thankfully by that time we\u2019d already seen most of what we wanted to. Possibly quieter during the week but would still recommend an early start as this seems to be when they are",
          "Went in Monday mid afternoon. Only crowd was for the tram. Definitely needed to avoid a long uphill walk. Since we are all 60+ admission was free. Bring a real camera with a zoom lens instead of a phone if you want to fully capture panda cuteness.",
          "Go early to avoid the worst of the crowds. The pandas are very well cared for and we got to see the adult, teenage and baby giant pandas as well as the more energetic red pandas. Be there when it opens at 8am, 2-3 hours is more than enough time to explore the park",
          "Basically it is a zoo dedicated mainly to the giant panda, with a couple of difficult to see reds as well. Beautifully laid out in a park like setting. You get to see the nursery as well as older and adult pandas fairly close up. Compounds are excellent and large so don\u2019t let",
          "You haven\u2019t been to Chengdu unless you have visited the pandas. How many you will see is kind of hit or miss, but I was satisfied. Do it.",
          "If you don't like crowds get there early. Our fabulous guide Peter made sure we were there by 8.00am to avoid long queues. Once inside you have the option of waiting for the small electric buggy or, much easier, just stroll along the paths to the enclosures. We were there early",
          "This place is incredible. It is kept largely natural and panda enclosures are spacious. We visited early in the morning when pandas were relatively active - eating and eating more. Some were jostling and playing. We didn\u2019t get to see new born pandas but i guess it\u2019s better to",
          "Never seen so many Pandas. I am not really a fan of zoos but the enclosures were not exactly cages. Very striking animals to say the least. It was a Saturday morning and raining but was really busy, which I guess is most days. It's quite a big place and the grounds are well",
          "If you are over 60 you get in free! Just bring your passport otherwise full price is 55 rmb and 27 rmb for student discount. Pay 10rmb to ride the shuttle and is well worth it.",
          "What a great place to visit if you love to see the gentle giants!! Pandas galore and so so cute! Love the cute pandas who thrilled the crowds in the open areas with their endless eating, climbing up the trees and basically just being their sweet selves! We went in the best",
          "Nice to see a million of Chinese wanting to see few pandas. Nice bamboo garden with no pandas. In summer all animals are hidden in the pavilions.",
          "We arrived at opening time and it really was worth the effort. We were the only ones watching the cubs in their enclosure before they were let out for their breakfast. There were a few more people when they were let out just after 8.00am but we could still see the pandas easily",
          "What an experience to visit with these cuties do up close and personal. So much worth it to hold them even if only s minute. Well maintained and organized facility. Great way to spend time in Chengdu.",
          "You can see pandas of various ages, up close. Go in the morning because they are the most active before 10am. You may need to wait a while, but eventually they'll do something fun, like climb a tree or wrestle with their buddies.",
          "Surprised by the amount of new buildings in Chengdu it is the Panda base is now in suburbia. The base is nicely laided out and there are red pandas and golden pheasants to observe as well,",

          "Lovely to see the pandas in a fairly natural setting. We saw a range of pandas from 4 days old to fully mature. We saw them swimming, playing, eating and sleeping. Great fun to watch. We also saw the unrelated red panda, very cute.",
          "My wife and i visited the panda research base and was fantastic thanks to our Wendy Wu guide who new what time was feeding and when babies were on show. We avoided the bigger crowds to a big extent and we were able to take some amazing photos and videos.",
          "China often gets a bad rep for their treatment of animals, but when it comes to their national treasure, they pull out all the stops. The facility is top notch. The enclosures are spacious, but you'll quickly feel a sense of claustrophobia with the amount of people. We visited",
          "I was lucky enough to be in a hotel near a metro station. I decided to try this method as it seemed as quick as a taxi. I paid my 4 yuan for my ticket, got off at Panda avenue, (All the station names are both in English and Chinese as well as how to buy a ticket- all very easy)",
          "Try and avoid weekends and public holidays, go early. If you are lucky a cooler overcast day you will see the 1 -2 yr olds at their active best, playing with each other or chasing their mum. There are big crowds but they move pretty quickly, so if you wait for a bit you can get",
          "Visiting the pandas is an obligatory thing to do when in Chengdu. I expected to see a few animals behind bars. What a surprise. This place really well laid out with areas set out so the pandas can roam around close to their wild environment. The baby pandas were a highlight. .",
          "We visited very early in the morning with the mist still present. No queues and few people there at that time. The pandas were busy eating bamboo and playing. Such charming playful mischievous animals. Captivating to watch. The baby pandas being reared were tiny and only",
          "The research base is about 30 minutes from the city centre. Highly recommend you get their at opening time, to beat the crowds and the pandas are more active in the mornings! Be prepared for a lot of walking, but you will find the Research Base well structured and easy to get",
          "I enjoyed the base a lot. I arrived at 9 am- metro line 3 to panda avenue , buy a ticket in the dedicated office upstairs then a free shuttle bid to the base. There is a fair bit of walking uphill once inside but it\u2019s worth it to see giant and red pandas in large open enclosures",
          "We were in a tour group...there is obviously a certain amount of walking to visit all the Pandas...but there are golf carts if mobility is limited. Always busy here , understandably...places to buy water nd good quality toilets. Also a restaurant on site called the Bamboo..very",
          "If you are in Chengdu you must visit this attraction. Take the metro to Panda Avenue Station (on the pink line.) After the metro station exit there was a shuttle bus operator where you could buy the admission ticket there and get a free shuttle to the base. That ended up",
          "Lots of people went see panda. Walk saw so beautiful baby panda my daughter trying take photos because army not nice say move move. I said to army my daughter wanted take good photos and army won\u2019t talk. Army no smiles to people. Went beautiful lunch enjoying!",
          "I absolutely loved it but have to say it was too crowded. We were lucky we were brought there by a driver from our hotel and he skipped the queue often for us and taught us to be rude. Otherwise we probably still would be queuing there and don't think we would see ever anything.",
          "Made the trip to chengdu to see the pandas! After reading all the reviews we got a taxi out to the breeding base early in the morning. Arriving there just before 730am. The ticket booth opens at 730 so we got our tickets and didn\u2019t have to wait to long in line to get in. The",
          "Visited the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base in early September 2018. We really enjoyed the place. Its better to keep at least two - three hours for the visit. One may experience both grown up giant pandas and baby pandas in this base. They also have a few red pandas in this",
          "Arrived early and crowded even then. But still worth it to see the pandas. Had a guide with us so may have avoided the worst if the masses.",
          "The pandas are super cute, but prepare yourself for thousand of tourist :)) during summer the pandas can't stand the heat and will be kept inside a small cool room with air condition. Fighting with thousand of other people who also trying to take a photo and you will see the"
